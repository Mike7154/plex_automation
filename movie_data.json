Unsurprisingly, just as in the original movie, there are frequent illegal street car races, often resulting in accidents and reckless driving. There is frequent profanity, including \"s--t\" and \"d--k.\" Though there are two strong female characters, women on the whole are little more than bikini-clad objects who exist to dance around the racing cars while the men slap their behinds or refer to them as little more than \"potential.\" The two lead characters settle their grudges by getting into a fistfight. Lots of gun violence. In perhaps the most disturbing scene in the movie, a man is tied down with a rat placed on his chest. The rat is covered by a bucket, and a man threatens to heat up the bucket so the rat chews through the bucket and attacks his private parts. Overall, this movie is little more than an exercise in \"car porn,\" with the story being little more than an excuse to get to the fast driving.\n|Positive Messages|: No positive messages in this one.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters and the action they get into are too unrealistic to be seen as positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent car races, chases, and crashes. A man is tortured by getting tied up and then getting a rat placed on his exposed chest with a bucket over the rat and a man threatening to heat the bucket with a torch so the rat chews through the bucket toward the man's private parts. Guns are pulled, pointed at heads and chests. A fistfight is encouraged as a way for two characters to try to make amends.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Frequent sexual references and innuendo. Women are often objectified, scantily clad.\n|Language|: Frequent profanity. \"Bitch,\" \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k.\" Spanish profanity. Women are referred to as \"potential\" by the two lead male characters.\n|Products & Purchases|: A Pepsi billboard is prominently displayed.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne drinking.

That's the story, but that's not what the movie is about. It's about action, a \"stunt reel\" from start to finish, including one very long car chase that almost destroys a city's downtown hub, including its pedestrians, buildings, and its entire infrastructure. And that's before we know who anyone is. Viewers can expect countless deaths of participants and innocent bystanders. Characters are shot (by machine guns and conventional weapons), run over, plummet to the ground, killed in vehicle accidents. Blood is everywhere -- it spurts, it pours, it emerges from heads, mouths, and wounds; a dripping eyeball takes center stage for a lengthy sequence. Language is coarse, with \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"pr--k,\" and a reference to masturbation. Sexual activity occurs in several scenes (one sequence between caring strangers, others are fast and crude). There's some social drinking (wine, beer, rum); no drunkenness. Not for kids or the squeamish.\n|Positive Messages|: Good defeats evil.\n|Positive Role Models|: Flawed, mysterious characters are courageous, determined, resourceful, loyal, and don't hesitate to use violence to defend themselves or to achieve their goals. Female characters are as powerful (and violent) as their male counterparts. Ethnic diversity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Relentless, extended action sequences. Bloody deaths from all manner of weaponry. Innocents are killed as well as combatants. Explosions, gunfire (machine guns, pistols, etc.), devastating vehicle crashes, fire, falls from buildings and structures, hand-to-hand fighting, wartime violence. Intense sequences with bloody wounds (including a dripping eyeball), point-blank shooting.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sexual activity: passionate kissing, undressing, thong, foreplay.

The scene in which a girl bears her breasts to a teacher is worth discussing.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroines demonstrate a very healthy attitude and strong self-esteem, defending their hearts and their bodies very capably. Kat and her father have a tough time communicating but eventually come to understand each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many references to sex.

Messages about popularity, compassion, personal values, and having integrity/being true to yourself are delivered with insight and humor. Because the story places a 13-year-old girl in the body of a 30-year-old, the main character's reaction to sexual situations is exaggerated and meant to be funny: There's \"boob\" talk, the beginnings of a striptease, a married man making a pass, mistaking sexual games for childhood board games, and the advent of a naked man (no actual nudity). Characters flirt, kiss, wear some revealing clothes, and use mild profanity and sexual language (\"jump your bones,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell\"). There's some drinking (the lead enjoys that part of being a grown-up); marijuana and mind-altering drugs are briefly mentioned.\n|Positive Messages|: Initially, 13-year-old Jenna is driven to be popular and have what she wants at any cost. But getting an unexpected look at herself at age 30 shows her that it's far more important to be kind, compassionate, generous, honest, and true to your own values and talents (i.e. to have integrity). And she begins to understand that, by making mistakes, she'll learn how to make things right.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jenna goes from being a self-centered, awkward girl who's willing to do anything to be liked by the \"in\" group to an independent-thinking, unselfish, ethical young woman who becomes immune to peer pressure. Parents are supportive, understanding, and loving. The world of magazine publishing is presented as cutthroat, shallow, and materialistic. Little ethnic diversity. One featured gay character.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The leading lady forcefully pushes a man away from her and follows with a kick to the crotch.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of double meanings, sexual references, and humorous sexual moments. It's all meant in fun as an innocent 13-year-old is unexpectedly thrust into adult situations. She discovers a naked man in her apartment (no actual nudity; she holds up an umbrella to cover him), squelches a pass from a married colleague, appreciates her new womanly body and sexy clothing, inappropriately flirts with a young teen boy, and ends up in a new acquaintance's apartment thinking the games he wants to play are Monopoly and Battleship. Romantic kissing.\n|Language|: \"Bulls--t,\" \"Holy Christ,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"jump your bones,\" and some bodily references (\"testicles,\" \"balls,\" \"butt\" and \"thingy,\" referring to a penis).\n|Products & Purchases|: Visuals of brands/products including Fed Ex, Bloomingdale's, Chanel, \"For Dummies\" books,\" Cole Haan, New York City's CBGB Club. Shots of Times Square with some businesses identified. Razzles candy plays a role in the story. The games Battleship and Monopoly are mentioned.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many scenes show social drinking. The 13-year-old in a 30-year-old body has her first experiences with adult beverages and gets slightly tipsy. An underage girl talks about buying beer. Marijuana and a couple of illegal drugs are mentioned briefly.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f35256fc551001ef80aa5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/17-again", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that they may want to think twice before letting young tween High School Musical fans see this PG-13 rated comedy, which is edgier than most of star Zac Efron's previous work. There's a scene of teens drinking at a party and a fair number of sexual references. It's generally more talk than action, but there's some making out, a teen girl gets pregnant, and one character hoards condoms. But curse words are few and fairly mild (\"ass\" and \"bitch\") and violence is at a minimum (of the two \"fight\" scenes, one is cartoonish, the other lukewarm). Parents may appreciate the fact that Efron's character implores his fellow teens to make so-called \"smart\" decisions about sexual activity and college.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters learn lessons about appreciating family and making smart decisions. But to get there, they navigate some tricky situations (for instance, a high school senior gets his girlfriend pregnant and gives up college to marry her and find a job, leaving him frustrated and resentful).\n|Positive Role Models|: Some students clearly relish bullying others; some girls practically throw themselves at guys (one says a guy doesn't even have to remember her name as long as he sleeps with her), and vice versa. A teen boy binges on junk food.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One scene features intense slapping. In another, a grown-up swings a hatchet and light saber against a teen, but the scene is played cartoonishly. Some bullying and brief fistfights.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: More references than actual sex/action. A teen girl makes out with her boyfriend frequently. In one scene, a teen girl tries to seduce a guy with animal role-play. Conversations sometimes include sexual innuendoes; one guy hoards condoms because he says he has \"needs.\" Discussion of abstinence and why it works (or not) for teens. A teen boy kisses a woman old enough to be his mother. A teenage girl gets pregnant, and her high school boyfriend offers to marry her. Girls throw themselves at a guy, essentially offering sex. Adult couple show in bed together. A boy wearing nothing but a shield (nudity implied) walks out of a party.\n|Language|: Fairly mild; some use of \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"dick,\" \"whore,\" \"oh my God,\" and the like. One \"s--t\" in a song.\n|Products & Purchases|: Products featured in the movie include Captain Crunch, Pringles, Nutella, and Old Milwaukee Beer.

That said, the subject matter is pretty serious, and there are some fairly violent scenes -- a security officer punches counters with a closed, ring-bedecked fist -- as well as lots of smoking, drinking, swearing, and, of course, gambling. The students also meet up post-gambling at a strip club, and there are plenty of cleavage shots and some passionate clinches.\n|Positive Messages|: The students involved in the scheme are aware that what they're doing isn't necessarily playing by the rules, and they seem quite attracted to the rush. They also happily indulge in the spoils, drinking to excess, hooking up with strangers, and throwing money around (one seems to have a shoplifting habit, and fake IDs are used to subvert the authorities and protect the students' true identities). Still, it's clear that, for them, it's not necessarily about total greed (except perhaps for their mentor, Professor Rosa). Also, for Ben, this enterprise is a means to a seemingly noble end: paying for medical school without having to rely on anyone for help. Plus, he comes to an understanding that his game isn't without its cost.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A security officer takes delight in beating up anyone caught counting cards; he even wears special rings on his fingers to make the experience more painful (the bloody aftermath is shown on camera). He also flashes a gun, and another gun is fired in a casino. Some loud arguments between friends.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Strippers do their thing at a club (lots of cleavage shots); Jill propositions Ben, and they make love in front of a window (they're shown from the top half, kissing passionately, naked); mild jokes about masturbation.\n|Language|: Some salty language, including \"goddamn,\" \"bulls--t,\" and the like.\n|Products & Purchases|: Practically feels like a commercial for Las Vegas, with scene upon scene of casinos, gamblers, and the strip. Signage is everywhere, from the Hard Rock Cafe to Planet Hollywood to The Mirage. A book that teaches the students how to count cards is clearly shown. Shopping sprees take place in stores that are clearly marked out front or by shopping bags, including Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Also many mentions of Google, Sizzler, MIT, Harvard Medical School, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of drinking in Boston pubs and at the Vegas casinos and strip bars. Tons of smoking in those locales as well.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776920594b2b001e69dbd2": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/21-and-over", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that 21 and Over was written and directed by the same team that wrote The Hangover and features the same type of raunchy humor, if perhaps at not quite the same level of excess (though it's plenty over the top!). The comedy follows three friends through a single night of debauchery as they celebrate a 21st birthday, a momentous event that they believe should be celebrated by getting as wasted as possible. They drink at parties, they drink at bars, they even drink in a taxi. Then they drink some more, until one of them is completely passed out. There's a string of misadventures, a few fights, and some sexual harassment -- plus near-nonstop profanity (\"f--k,\" \"s--t\" and much more), people smoking pot at a party, and a few brief glimpses of topless women and almost-nude men seen from behind. Men make out in one scene.\n|Positive Messages|: In the process of reuniting to celebrate a 21st birthday, three formerly close friends rekindle their friendship. Though their antics are juvenile -- and many of their actions, especially when it comes to excessive drinking, flat-out irresponsible -- their feelings are heartfelt. Jokes rely on sexism and stereotypes for laughs.\n|Positive Role Models|: Miller and Casey are devoted to Jeff and struggle to get him safely home after a wild night. But they're also poor influences who induce Jeff to go out drinking the night before an important medical school interview. They also glorify drinking to excess, insisting that it's their duty to get as wasted as possible when one of their number turns 21.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several people get into a barroom brawl, throwing both punches and stools. They later go at it again, with one man using a baseball bat to destroy several household objects. A woman uses self-defense techniques, including a knee to the groin, to subdue a man. Two almost-nude men are subjected to ritual violence, including being spanked with a paddle. They later wrestle each other, still almost completely naked. A buffalo charges through a crowd, butting several people.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many, many crude sexual references, though little actual physical contact. A guy and a girl flirt with each other all through the film and eventually kiss. A guy drinks shots that are tucked between breasts and placed on navels. A few brief flashes of topless women, and several longer scenes feature almost-nude men seen from behind. Two men walk around wearing nothing but socks on their penises; they also make out. A stuffed animal is shown glued to a man's genitals.\n|Language|: Near-constant swearing includes just about every crude word imaginable. \"F--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"t-ts,\" \"d--kwad,\" \"c--klicker,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"douche-bag,\" and many more. Almost every sentence involves profanity.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some characters drink Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Other labels/brands seen include Budweiser, Bud Light, and Soundgarden.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The characters spend an entire debauched night getting more and more wasted, with many sequences of people drinking beer, shots, more beer, playing drinking games, slurping liquor off of women's bodies, sucking straight from a keg tap, and drinking some more. A few scenes feature people smoking pot, and one character mentions that he spent an entire night dancing after taking LSD.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768a6594b2b001e691db4": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/21-jump-street", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that 21 Jump Street is an often crude (but irreverently funny) action/buddy comedy based on the popular '80s TV series that launched Johnny Depp's career. This version stars popular actors Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as bumbling cops who attempt to redeem themselves by going undercover to bust a high school drug ring. The storyline leads to plenty of drug content (there's also pot smoking and some underage drinking), and you can also expect lots of strong language (including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more), crude references, and sexual innuendoes.\n|Positive Messages|: 21 Jump Street's main message is that friendship trumps high school stereotypes and popularity contests -- as long as you keep an eye on what's important (relationships) and what's not (your position in an imposed hierarchy).\n|Positive Role Models|: The two lead characters are sometimes inept and inane and not always supportive of each other, but in the end they realize the error of their ways.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of it, but generally played cartoonishly (and lots of slow-motion scenes). A character rejoices when his friend shoots someone (it's a gross-out moment); guns are drawn and pointed at someone's head. Though most of the fight scenes are cartoonish in nature, blood is shed. And cops rejoice after arresting and shooting people.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Three people are shown in a state of undress while in the middle of a sex act (though there's no graphic nudity); in an end-credits scenes, two couples are seen together. Also lots of crude language and sex talk, including discussion of teens hooking up and/or wanting to. Some kissing and sexual gestures; genitalia are drawn on family photographs and also can be glimpsed briefly in a non-sexual context.\n|Language|: Very frequent use of strong language, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"p---y,\" \"prick,\" \"d--k,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"oh my God\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: It's a teen movie, so the products that teens use -- laptops, phones, etc. -- are on display. But there's not a lot of label-dropping.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The plot centers around the arrest of a drug ring that deals in a high school; they've created a synthetic drug whose effects have been chronicled on a website. The video has gone viral, and the 21 Jump Street agents have to stop the drug from spreading, too. There's also pot-smoking and some underage drinking at parties.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a097a53e9001e6f8491": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/22-jump-street", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sequel to 2012's hit 21 Jump Street is nearly as hilarious -- and easily as crass. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return as undercover cops Schmidt and Jenko; their bromance is one of the franchise's main selling points, and they keep it going here. Expect tons of lewd and crude jokes about sex, college, work, and the like (some jokes about a strong friendship between two guys have a homophobic subtext that comes off as overly tasteless/uncomfortable instead of funny). There isn't much nudity, but couples are seen in their underwear, presumably post hook-up; co-eds converge on a spring break beach community in skimpy bathing suits; and one scene shows a man pretending to perform a sex act on another. There's also action movie-style violence, from gun fights and hand-to-hand combat to car chases and explosions, but mostly portrayed in a cartoonish fashion and  is played for laughs. Prepare for loads of swearing -- including \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and many variations on \"f--k\" -- and some underage drinking at college parties. As in the first one, the plot has a drug-related focus (the guys are investigating a new recreational drug that killed a college student).\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the over-the-top shenanigans is the message that to be successful, partners must communicate well with each other, be unafraid about being honest, and be willing to compromise. Also, loyalty matters -- and don't do drugs.\n|Positive Role Models|: Schmidt and Jenko make plenty of mistakes, but they also treat each other like brothers and watch out for each other (most of the time).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Gun fights and fist fights, plus a car chase and an explosion or two. People get shot and hurt, but there's little blood, and the violence is cartoonish and sometimes played for laughs. A man and a woman get into a tussle, with the woman being the main aggressor. A kidnapping by fraternity brothers. In one scene, a young boy shoots a gun (at inanimate objects).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of college kids are shown waking up in bed together, wearing underwear. One scene shows a man pretending to perform a sex act on another. Lots of sexual innuendo/sexual references. One of the main characters sleeps with a supervisor's daughter. A woman alternates between hitting a man and asking him to sleep with her. One scene shows a young boy shooting a gun at sex toys. Women in skimpy swimsuits.\n|Language|: Very frequent use of a wide range of swear words, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"p---y,\" and more. A homophobic slur is also used, and there are some jokes with a homoerotic subtext that may strike some viewers as uncomfortable/tasteless.\n|Products & Purchases|: Product names/labels shown or mentioned include Sony, Under Armour, Nike, Vaio, Doritos, Lamborghini, Riddell, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: As in the first movie, much of the plot revolves around a drug; this time, one known as \"WHYPHY\" (Ecstasy plus Adderall). A girl dies because of the drug, and there's a scene in which Scmidt and Jenko accidentally take it and get high. They both \"trip out\"; nobody gets hurt, but they\u2019re obviously affected by it. Also several big parties at which college students, some underage, drink lots of beer and other liquor.

The message -- that women aren't truly happy if they're always the bridesmaid but never the bride -- verges on being a little overly retro, but since the movie is so frothy, it manages to get away with that such old-fashioned thinking. Star Katherine Heigl was in the hit comedy Knocked Up, so teens (particularly girls) will likely be interested.\n|Positive Messages|: Nothing too bad for the romcom genre, though there are the requisite plot-driving shenanigans: A woman pretends to be someone she's not to land a fianc\u00e9 ... who happens to be the man her sister loves; a reporter deceives a woman, making her think he's writing about something else when she's actually the subject of his expos\u00e9; a woman humiliates her sister at her engagement party. The overall message (that women aren't happy unless they're the bride, instead of the bridesmaid) feels a bit dated.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman slaps a man (hard) after he wrongs her; two sisters argue loudly, with one throwing objects at the other.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Deep kissing and making out (on a couch and in a car); sexual innuendoes (e.g. \"walk of shame\" and hooking up at weddings); a woman stands in her lingerie during a dress fitting.\n|Language|: A fairly generous sprinkling of the word \"s--t,\" plus \"whore\" and \"a--hole.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Visible/referenced brands include Budweiser (a bottle appears fairly prominently in one scene) and Filofax; the dressing room of Amsale, a wedding dress designer, is shown in one scene.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of drinking at wedding receptions; in a major scene, the two leads get plastered after drinking lots of hard liquor and beer.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682aeb5d26001f1de2ba": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/50-first-dates", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that some of the male characters in this movie don't treat women with respect. They lie to get into bed with women, and talk badly about their wives. True to form, there are numerous sexual references along with some lewd language. But the leading bad- boy in the movie does an about-face by becoming a loving, devoted boyfriend to a woman with a disability.\n|Positive Messages|: Though Henry starts out as a guy who lies to women he has one-night-stands with in order to keep himself unattached, he ends up being devoted to Lucy. In fact, he becomes so devoted that he helps her to overcome her disability. This is a comedy with some lewd and gross moments, as well as comedic portrayal of people with disabilities, but there is heart that beats beneath the surface.\n|Positive Role Models|: Henry definitely starts out as the poster boy for bad behavior, but he shapes up into a stand-up guy by the end of the movie. Lucy is a model of compassionate and kind behavior. Henry does use knowledge of Lucy's soft side to his advantage, but she knows how to stand up for herself -- she even protects herself by wielding sports equipment when she needs to.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick violence includes a character being beaten with a baseball bat by a woman (but he's not injured). Lucy is in a car accident and suffers from memory loss, which is a sadness that affects her family daily. A mention that Lucy's mother is deceased.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: From the start, we learn that Henry dates and has sex with many women. References to these escapades include comments like, \"He pounded me like a mallard duck.\" Though crude references and gestures are made, there are no naked images.

Characters smoke cigarettes regularly (one character also smokes a \"vape\"), and there's a scene of heavy drinking and cigar smoking at a party. Given that the film stars The Amazing Spider-Man's Andrew Garfield, teens may be interested.\n|Positive Messages|: The storyline is a spin on the Faust legend, in which a man sells his soul to the devil in exchange for riches; he loses focus on what matters but eventually realizes that family is the most important thing. The lessons of the economic crisis that began in 2008 (and in some ways, still continues) -- i.e. banks gambling on bad mortgages and earning huge profits by foreclosing -- are part of the plot; the movie manages to address these important issues without getting preachy or overbearing\n|Positive Role Models|: Dennis learns a huge lesson after selling his soul to the devil in exchange for riches and glory.

It has mild peril, slapstick violence, scenes inspired by classic horror movies, and potty humor. Main character Freddy (voiced by Ilai Swindells) is shunned by his werewolf family when he turns into a poodle. Freddy tries to overcome the odds, but the movie's message of acceptance is lost amid its misjudged tone. The death of a parent features heavily, with Freddy's father falling from a cliff. Freddy cries at the funeral and sobs under his bed with a photo of his dad. There are also several instances of bullying. For instance, when Freddy transforms into a poodle, he's forcibly dyed pink as way of emasculating him. Some scenes mimic classic horror movies and might be scary for young children. Violence includes long fights, dogs biting humans, and anger management issues played for laughs. There's a lot of potty humor, with \"butt sniffing\" dog jokes and a long sequence involving urine. When a character transforms into a human, he's naked and a hot dog is used to cover his genitals as part of an innuendo-based joke.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate, but some younger viewers may gain an interest in learning more about werewolf mythology.\n|Positive Messages|: The importance of teamwork -- working together with people no matter your differences and background.

The two bumbling puppy thieves are shown falling on an electric fence and getting their groins electrocuted before they're violently thrown off.

Although there's some very gruesome self-inflicted violence as the main character (who's played by James Franco) attempts to free himself -- some audience members reportedly passed out at preview screenings -- ultimately 127 Hours is a positive, life-affirming story about overcoming incredible odds. Those who have the stomach for the bloody parts can also expect some heavy language (not all that surprising, considering the movie's circumstances), and flashback scenes with drinking and sexual situations. There are also notable beverage product placements (Gatorade, Coke, Perrier, etc.) as the main character gets thirsty and dreams of something to drink.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has strong messages about triumphing over the odds and facing challenges with courage. Aron works hard to solve his problem, keeping his head and trying not to panic or give up.\n|Positive Role Models|: The movie presents Aron as a brave survivor and a hero, someone who faced incredible odds and won. He's not flawless; he swears a lot, and flashbacks show him in sexual situations and drinking, plus he probably could have avoided his situation entirely if he had been more responsible. But this event was a life-changer, and it clearly woke him up. During part of the movie, he engages in extreme survival techniques that may disturb some viewers, such as drinking urine.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense, gruesome self-inflicted violence; some reports say that audience members have passed out as a result of watching it. In the worst of it, Aron tries to saw through his own arm, which requires him to slice through flesh (blood is shown), snap the bone, and sever what looks like a nerve; the movie uses blasts of shrieking noise on the soundtrack to illustrate the pain. Close-ups and X-ray shots of the arm are seen. In an earlier, more carefree moment, Aron wipes out on his bike.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flashbacks show Aron with a former girlfriend. They're seen under a blanket, possibly naked, presumably after sex. There's innuendo and sex talk. A carload of teens performs a \"freeze-out,\" i.e. taking off all their clothes and rolling down the windows of a moving car on a cold night (very little actual nudity is shown).

Like Sin City, 300 is an ultraviolent tale based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller. There's blood galore as the Spartans -- trained war machines -- defend their land against Xerxes' massive Persian army. Battlefield valor and violence is glorified by the Spartans, who take no prisoners and show no mercy. Heads literally roll, blood splatters, exotic animals are sliced and speared. Many, many soldiers on either side die gruesomely. If on-screen death and war -- even one so stylized and cartoonish at times -- is too disturbing a subject matter for your kids (or you!), this bloodfest isn't a safe bet.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of underdog heroism and not bowing to corruption get a little lost in the blood and gore.\n|Positive Role Models|: Even in the face of sure defeat, brave soldiers stand firm against tyrannous threats to freedom. A corrupt Spartan councilman is exposed as a traitor and brought to justice.

They're physically skilled, shrewd, brave, and untiring in their pursuit to do what's necessary to save the world from extreme danger. While each is tough and capable as a solo agent, the clear message is that women are stronger together. Each reflects the culture of her country of origin to some degree, and many languages are spoken. Frequent action violence includes highly choreographed combat moves, gunfire, punches, kicks, explosions, and stabbings. These scenes aren't graphic and don't have a huge amount of emotional impact -- but a hostage situation is far tenser and may be too much for sensitive viewers. A long-term friendship gets romantic, with kissing on a bed and the implication of sex. There's drinking throughout and reference to selling cocaine. Strong language includes \"a--hole\" and one use of \"f--k.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Women are strong, and they're even stronger together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main characters are working for their government with the intent of serving the greater good, putting their own lives at risk so that others can go about their lives without worry.

They do work that's most often credited to men in the movies while, for those who have them, male domestic partners tend to the home front. The women are in control of their image and aren't sexualized.

The camera follows the young soldiers in one long tracking shot, making it feel like you're right in the action. Consequently, it all feels very real, and tension runs extremely high. Battle violence is graphically realistic, including shootings, strangling, stabbing, bombings, etc. Wounded soldiers are bloody, missing limbs, and crying in pain. Soldiers smoke (accurate for the era), drink, and use strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t\"). Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth make cameo appearances alongside stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman.\n|Positive Messages|: War is hell. Camaraderie and loyalty can help motivate people in dire circumstances. You can make headway in the worst situation if you persevere and focus on your goal. Themes include compassion and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Blake and Schofield demonstrate incredible courage for the greater good, as well as compassion for others -- including the enemy.

While much of the humor was not that great to begin with, decades later, this movie has not gotten better with age, especially the jokes at the expense of homosexuals and the mentally ill. There is frequent strong sexual innuendo, including a sex scene in which Ace and a woman make the bed shake and bounce as the animals watch. There is also a joke in which a character says that a former Miami Dolphins player who has a brief role in this movie \"should die of gonorrhea.\" Expect frequent profanity, including variations of \"s--t.\" Some toilet humor when Ace emerges from the men's room of a socialite's party drenched in water. A man jumps off his penthouse balcony and is killed. People fall off cars and balconies and into shark-infested fish tanks.\n|Positive Messages|: The women in the movie serve little purpose beyond sex and cleavage.

A son has never properly forgiven his father for dying young and takes it out on his mother, who's also grieving. When an older version of himself shows up, he's drawn into an adventure that gives him the chance to go back in time and repair those relationships. But that adventure is quite dangerous, and while it allows the child to escape bullying kids who tease and punch him, it also puts his life in jeopardy repeatedly. Multiple deadly fights with futuristic soldiers involve weapons used to kill by shooting, stabbing (one bloody wound is treated), disintegrating, electrocuting, and beating. A tween attacks soldiers with a video game-like drone system. Car chases result in vehicles being shot at, flipped over, and exploded. A man jokes about wanting to drown an annoying kid. There's also a lot of language (\"s--t,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddammit,\" \"bitch,\" and more). Expect to see kissing, sexual innuendo, and drinking, too. Underlying the action are positive messages about the importance of family, the value of communicating genuine emotions, and the benefits of \"being a nerd.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Our time on earth is short. It's easier to be angry than sad, but sometimes you can forget there's a difference. Family provides a child's place in the world and sense of identity. Kids don't need a parent to be perfect; they just need a parent to be there for them. Sometimes scientific discoveries can be used for negative purposes. It pays to be a nerd.\n|Positive Role Models|: People make personal sacrifices, including risking their own lives, for the larger good of humanity. Parents and kids learn they can support each other through difficult periods rather than retreating into their own emotions. Adults and kids both cover their true emotions with sarcasm and feigned indifference. A father shares his love and pride for his grown son.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main characters are mostly White except the lead character's wife, who is Black. Main characters are \"nerds\" and scientists, and a running theme is how being a nerd can pay off.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Bullying kids tease and punch an asthmatic kid smaller than them.

It's not quite as macabre as its live-action predecessors, but there's still plenty of dark humor, an emphasis on violence and weapons, and incidents when townsfolk raise arms against the eerie Addamses. Insult language includes words like \"freaks,\" \"monsters,\" and \"lemmings,\" as well as a few Addams family spins on endearments or encouragements (like \"do your worst\" and \"kick your father goodnight\"). As always, Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) are presented as caring parents who are very much in love; the movie also promotes acceptance, teamwork, and empathy. Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard co-star as Addams children Wednesday and Pugsley.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes accepting those who are different from you and not forcing conformity and assimilation on everyone. Parker and Wednesday each rebel in their own way but want to feel loved unconditionally and be accepted as they test their boundaries. Character strengths such as teamwork and empathy are important to the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gomez and Morticia love each other and their kids. Wednesday wants to see what's beyond her family's mansion. Parker doesn't want to go along with everyone else like her mother wants. Not a lot of cultural inclusion, but there is equal focus on girl and boy characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Townsfolk with pitchforks, torches drive Addams family out of the Old Country (Eastern Europe). They respond by using swords; instead of injuring people, they slice open their trousers (which fall and reveal underwear). People hurl and catapult fiery rocks/boulders that cause lots of property damage. A character is struck by a car but survives. Wednesday's braids end in the form of a noose. Wednesday and Pugsley often fight with weapons and explosives, and it's common for Wednesday to shoot an arrow at Fester. An Addams rite of passage requires each Addams to do a choreographed dance with a special sword. At school, Wednesday shocks the dissection frogs back to life. A climactic confrontation between the Addams and the Assimilation town causes property damage, minor injuries. The house itself yells \"Get out!\" in a spooky voice. A girl is an overt bully at school. Most of the dark/violent content is intended to be funny.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: As always, Gomez and Morticia are deeply in love and passionate -- kissing, embracing, slow-dancing. Thing is caught scrolling through internet images of bejeweled and manicured hands that are clearly implied to be \"hand\" pornography.

Like that film, it's not as scary as its live-action predecessors, but there's no shortage of dark humor or cartoon violence. Wednesday (voiced by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) is perpetually trying to kill/harm her brother Pugsley (Javon \"Wanna\" Walton), and she traps a man who hangs upside down over a cliff before presumably falling to his death. It has big explosions; characters in peril, held captive, or sedated; human experimentation; fighting; an homage to the movie Carrie (with red paint instead of blood); and a destructive battle between gigantic monsters. Some of the creatures in the Addams Family world can look scary, and the family experiences emotional moments when they're told that Wednesday may not biologically be an Addams. Expect to hear insult language like \"freak\" and \"weirdo,\" as well as a few Addams-style endearments (like \"murderous maternal instincts\" and \"witch\"). Gomez (Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) continue to be depicted as caring parents who are very much in love (kissing, dancing, and exchanging affectionate gestures and innuendoes fairly frequently). This movie also finds Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll) advising Pugsley on dating, resulting in some pretty cheesy pickup lines and flirting. A joke substitutes \"tentacles\" for \"testicles.\" Adult characters drink in a couple of scenes. Ultimately, the movie promotes communication, teamwork, and the value of a family's unconditional love.\n|Educational Value|: Audiences will learn about the classic Addams family, but otherwise this is for entertainment.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes honesty in family communication, accepting those who are different from you, realizing that families can include members with different personalities and interests. Character strengths such as teamwork and empathy are important to the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gomez and Morticia are incredibly affectionate, love each other, are attentive and kind parents. Wednesday is very intelligent and curious; her feelings about being different from others/her family are developmentally appropriate for someone her age (though trying to kill her brother is not). Fester is a kind and encouraging uncle, if sometimes misguided.\n|Diverse Representations|: Not much cultural inclusion. Majority of characters present as White, although Snoop Dogg plays Cousin It. Female characters have agency. Despite being kooky and creepy outsiders, the Addamses are a traditional multigenerational family.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A youth beauty pageant includes a tribute to Carrie; red paint rains down on contestants, covering them like blood. Bikers at a bar get into a brief brawl, arm wrestle, push and shove one another. Lurch and another bodyguard are scary looking. Wednesday traps a man who hangs upside down over a cliff. Later he's gone, so it's assumed he's fallen to his death. A scientist uses a gas to poison and sedate people. A man holds a family captive, plans to experiment on them. A man turns into a giant octopus and fights another human who has transformed into a giant blend of three animals. The Addams family causes an explosion at the Grand Canyon and mass chaos at a science fair.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Morticia and Gomez are frequently passionate with each other: kissing, embracing, slow-dancing. Pugsley has a crush on Ophelia, and they flirt and eventually hug and touch foreheads. Uncle Fester offers dating advice and mentions writing a how-to book about dating and romance. Fester and Pugsley have several conversations about dating. Cousin It is shown to be a ladies' creature. A joke substitutes \"tentacles\" for \"testicles.\"\n|Language|: \"He gave me the finger\" joke when Uncle Fester literally hands a man a severed finger. \"Freak,\" \"weird,\" \"monsters,\" \"poop,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Big Progressive Insurance billboard is featured in a scene. Addams Family franchise has lots of off-screen tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Wednesday serves a potion in a martini glass.

It's all played for laughs, of course -- as is the seriously stressful business of trying to get into college -- but tweens and teens who aren't involved in the admissions cycle might not appreciate the jokes quite as much. Expect some swearing (mostly \"s--t\" and \"damn\"), frank references to sex and drinking (primarily in college, where a teenager is shown attending a party with students who are partaking, though he doesn't drink himself), and sometimes-scathing discussions about high school seniors and their college applications.\n|Positive Messages|: Life may seem like a mess, and maybe it is, but sometimes it has to be for you to figure out what you truly want. Also, surprises don't have to destabilize us forever; often, they help us find balance and get on better footing.\n|Positive Role Models|: Portia cares a lot for her high school applicants, even when her job requires her to be impassive. Despite her rigid ways, she's open to new information, even if it's not so flattering or is hard to deal with, and she wants to learn from her past mistakes. That said, she's very competitive with a fellow female admissions counselor, which could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes of rivalries between women.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman fires a shotgun at a man she thinks may be harassing her daughter. (He's not.) A woman screams at a male character.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adult characters kiss (the first time, accidentally) and take a shower in separate but adjacent stalls. (All viewers see are their shoulders.) Sexual encounters are implied (a couple is shown kissing/groping/starting to remove clothes before and then buttoning back up after, but not during). Some frank sexual references and humor related to a woman's prosthetic breasts (her character previously had a double mastectomy).\n|Language|: One \"f--k,\" plus occasional use of \"s--t,\" \"screw,\" \"prick,\" \"damn,\" \"twat,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of Princeton name-dropping and crest-flashing (and many scenes feature clothing and paraphernalia in Princeton orange).

The action is virtually nonstop and includes swashbuckling pirate violence, explosions, kidnapping, and gun shots. Some of the scenes might be too peril-filled for younger elementary-aged viewers, but kids who like Indiana Jones-style fun will be entertained. Of more concern to some parents may be the fact that one of the main characters is perpetually drunk or looking for his next shot of whisky throughout much of the movie; others disapprove of his behavior, but it's a big part of the film. That aside, with its teen hero and a suspenseful plot full of high-seas intrigue, The Adventures of Tintin is an ideal animated adventure for middle-graders and up.\n|Positive Messages|: Tintin proves that one person -- a young one at that -- can make a huge difference.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tintin is courageous, industrious, and incredibly smart. Though young, he lives independently, with only Snowy to keep him company. He single-handedly figures out a mystery and is intrepid about discovering the truth. And even in the face of danger, he helps others, like Captain Haddock.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Quite a bit of action violence, particularly the sequences featuring the pirates. Characters use guns, and there are also explosions, swords, razors, and fires that Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock must try to evade.

But the main characters (played by Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin) don't rush into sex despite their intense attraction, and all scenes are consensual. There's both same-sex and opposite-sex kissing. Parents are portrayed as struggling to overcome flaws themselves, including alcoholism and broken marriages. Partying, with alcohol and drugs, is depicted as a fact of college life. Infrequent swearing includes a use of \"s--t.\" Teens may pick up positive messages about love and friendship, but they could also walk away with superficial notions of romance and college life.\n|Positive Messages|: Peers, including friends and romantic partners, can be cruel to one another, but deeper relationships are shown to last. Teens can learn that being mean doesn't feel good. College is portrayed as a time of experimentation, self-discovery. Peer pressure -- to party, play drinking games, break rules, skip class, get a tattoo, etc. -- is seen as inevitable but surmountable.

No private parts are shown, but the scenes are explicit, including movements, suggested orgasms, implications of oral sex, close-ups of thighs, mentions of condoms and being \"turned on,\" and hands on private parts on top of and under each other's clothes. College-age young adults taunt each other with sexual language like \"skank\" and \"whore.\" This often comes as part of wild party scenes at a frat house, where there's heavy drinking, drinking games, bongs, flirting, and hooking up. Drinking is a theme in the film as Hardin struggles with an alcohol addiction, and he \"self-medicates\" with alcohol when things don't go his way.

College-age young adults taunt each other about \"carpet sucking,\" '\"d--k sucking,\" being a \"skank,\" and being a \"whore.\" Tessa goes \"commando\" (doesn't wear underwear) one evening, calls to let Hardin know.

Tessa is encouraged to share enormous bowl of \"Sex on the Beach\" with her workmate and a potential investor. She's encouraged to play beer pong, involving multiple shots of vodka. She gets drunk in both scenes. Hardin struggles with alcohol addiction; when things go badly for him, he resorts to heavy drinking (wine, liquor).

Other scenes include multiple martial arts fights, wild driving, kids captured and held against their will, and some cartoonish scary villains. Many bad guys' off-camera deaths are a result of the young lead's heroics. Mild, campy sexuality includes some revealing clothing, a comic scene in which the young hero is instructed in ways to attract girls, X-ray vision glimpses of undies, and a few leering males and breast jokes. Occasional potty humor and coarse language (\"crap,\" \"screwed\"), and twice the hero is asked, \"Are you in Special Ed?\" -- meant as an insult.\n|Positive Messages|: Good triumphs over evil. In a fantasy world, kids can be as powerful and heroic as adults.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though loving and kind, Cody's parents are gullible and ineffective. Adult authority figures (mostly members of a farcical CIA) are far less intelligent than their youthful counterparts, and are mostly rigid and clueless. One Asian stereotype -- a driving instructor -- speaks pidgin English and is an exaggerated caricature. Rich kids are described as \"spoiled brats\"; they harass and haze the hero. There's ethnic diversity throughout the cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Almost nonstop exaggerated action, starting with a baby at the wheel of a careening, out-of-control car and his rescue by a skateboard-riding teen daredevil in the opening sequence. From then on there are: fist fights, martial arts battles, jet ski and snowboard chases, a wild driving lesson, fires, crashes, launches through glass, a melting face, numerous narrow escapes, the \"plastification\" of a villain, a tense countdown to a massive explosion, and assorted falls, captures, and rescues. Despite all of the above, the violence is not played as real and most characters do not die on camera.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Cody\u2019s statuesque CIA handler wears low-cut tops and bare midriffs.

The bad guy, Jafar, can be pretty scary for younger kids with his sorcery and mind control -- as can scenes in which Aladdin is chased by henchmen with giant swords and mythological monsters. There's also some cultural stereotyping: scheming Arab and Jewish merchants with large noses, for instance. Potty humor includes burping and bad guys getting the seat of their garish underwear torn off by an angry tiger. But Genie provides plenty of comic relief to the more dangerous moments; the late Robin Williams is in full-force free association as Genie's voice, channeling everyone from Rodney Dangerfield to William F. Buckley and providing some laughs for the adults in the room, too. Also expect a bit of mild name-calling and some revealing outfits on Princess Jasmine and curvy dancers. Overall, the theme of being true to yourself should resonate with families and inspire discussion between parents and younger kids about not changing who you are simply to please others.\n|Educational Value|: Retelling of Middle Eastern folktale and one of the best-known stories in the classic work Arabian Nights.\n|Positive Messages|: \"Love conquers all\" is the big message; also themes of friendship, loyalty, honesty, fulfilling your promises. Characters learn and demonstrate courage, perseverance, humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aladdin is a sweet underdog with a big heart, but he's also pretty obsessed with treasure and puts himself in all kinds of dangerous situations to get it. He pretends to be someone he's not to impress Jasmine. Jasmine is spirited and has strong opinions. Genie is loyal to Aladdin beyond the requirements of their bond. Jasmine's father is caring and attentive, though weak-minded. Jafar is a terrifying leader who subjects people to punishment and peril.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Stereotypes Middle East as barbaric and features two-dimensional caricatures of Arabs and Jewish people. Jasmine doesn't have enough agency.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Big henchmen pursue Aladdin with swords, threats to Aladdin's life. Scary mythical monsters, perilous chase scenes, and near escapes. Jasmine is chained to a chair and forced to feed Jafar. One character is eaten by a mythical sand creature.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Very curvy ladies dance about in scanty outfits -- in fact all women are barely clad in this movie.

As with previous remakes like Dumbo, Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast, there are lots of computer-generated special effects, including the quite scary Cave of Wonders and co-star Will Smith as the huge, comedic, blue-skinned Genie. The effects and the live-action factor make the scenes of peril and danger feel more intense than in the cartoon (although it's pretty tame for a Guy Ritchie-directed movie). There are chases, falls, and near deaths, as well as one confirmed fatality when villain Jafar pushes a man down a dark well. The cave crumbles and spews lava, a giant bird pursues the characters, guards are armed with weapons, and there are references to dead parents. Language is very mild, with just a few insults along the lines of \"street rat\"; characters flirt and kiss, and Genie tosses back a couple of martinis (a pipe also appears). Thanks to stars Mena Massoud (Aladdin) and Naomi Scott (Jasmine), this musical remake keeps the spirit of the original and adds a boost of female empowerment to messages about friendship, courage, integrity, and honesty.\n|Educational Value|: Kids familiar with animated version will learn about adaptations and impact of live-action stories vs. animated ones. They'll also learn about importance of being true to themselves and of women's worth as leaders.\n|Positive Messages|: It's important to look beneath the surface (social class, rank, etc.) to really know who people are inside. Other positive messages include idea that women -- not just men -- can be powerful, inspiring leaders and that true connection and love transcend superficial differences. Promotes value of telling the truth, honor, friendship, thinking of others' needs, and the ability to break free from outdated traditions. Courage and integrity are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aladdin is a thief but also helps others even less fortunate and cares about people -- and the princess. He's clever, brave, kind. He gets caught up in advantages of wealth and power but ultimately remains true to himself, demonstrating integrity. Jasmine is intelligent, thoughtful, empathetic. She grows to love Aladdin for who he his, not his status. Genie, despite being a slave to his master, is full of good advice for Aladdin. He's helpful, outspoken and teaches Aladdin about friendship. Jafar is power hungry, manipulative but is clearly a villain. The sultan is a little less clueless here than he was in the original.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cave of Wonders is scary. When Abu breaks the rules, it crumbles and spews lava, nearly killing Aladdin and Abu. Falls and perilous climbs/pursuits/flights. Jafar pushes a man to his death in a dark, creepy dungeon, later uses his powers to disappear people and torture the sultan. He also tries to kill Aladdin by pushing him, bound, into the water (it's a tense scene for a few moments while Aladdin is in danger of drowning). A giant bird chases the heroes, causing damage. Jafar is scary when he wields his full powers. Sultan's armed guards take hold of various people and chase/capture Aladdin. Genie is forced to make even dangerous wishes come true. Arguing. References to both Jasmine's mother and Aladdin's parents being dead. Carpet is damaged during an action scene, which could upset some young kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting, hand-holding, dancing, a few kisses. Genie makes a double-meaning comment about \"feeling a little thirsty\" after staring at Jasmine's handmaiden, Dalia; Dalia calls Genie \"incredibly attractive.\" Possible reference to someone as \"hot\" (hard to hear). A woman calls Aladdin \"tasty\" in a song lyric.\n|Language|: Some insults: \"street rat,\" \"riffraff,\" \"nothing,\" \"scoundrel,\" \"thief,\" etc. Misogynist comments like Jasmine should \"be seen and not heard,\" \"be silent,\" \"hurry up, woman,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in film itself, but off camera Disney has endless merchandising tie-ins, from apparel and accessories to toys and games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Genie has martinis on a couple of occasions.

During 11-year-old Alexander's very bad day, his 13-year-old sister (Kerris Dorsey) drinks cough medicine from the bottle and ends up drunk, his dad (Steve Carell) accidentally sets his shirt on fire, and his 16-year-old brother (Dylan Minnette) picks up his cell phone during a driving test, then gets into a car accident. Additional mayhem also ensues, but amidst the chaos, Alexander's family manages to support each other and ends up even stronger than they were before. There's also some mild language (butt jokes, \"crap,\" \"idiot,\" \"sucks,\" etc.) and inappropriate behavior (cyberbullying, the suggestion that party performers are going to start stripping, etc.), but ultimately this is a sweet, entertaining movie with positive messages about finding humor in adversity and coming together as a family.\n|Positive Messages|: Over the course of their horrible day, the Coopers learn that being part of a loving family is more important than being popular, having a pretty girlfriend, pleasing a demanding boss, nailing a job interview, or just about anything else. They stay positive (and find humor) in the face of adversity, for the most part, and are there for each other when it matters.\n|Positive Role Models|: During the terrible day, the worst in all of the Coopers comes out: Parents are distracted (dad Ben ignores the baby during a job interview and lets him eat a marker), important responsibilities are ignored (mom Kelly ignores her job for a long time after she creates a catastrophe at work), teens make big mistakes (texting while driving, drinking enough cough medicine to basically get drunk before going on stage, etc.), etc. But ultimately they all support each other when the chips are down, and there's no question that they're a loving, caring, hardworking, down-to-earth group. Really, the terrible day helps them all admit and face up to their weaknesses and become stronger as a family. They demonstrate perseverance and teamwork when things get tough. There\u2019s some brief cyberbullying when a classmate takes a picture of Alexander and puts his picture on the face of bikini-clad women and spreads the photo around school. And Anthony's girlfriend is self-centered and materialistic, but she's clearly not intended to be a positive role model.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few loud pratfalls involving the kids and the adults. Anthony gets in an accident while taking his driver\u2019s test; the van is damaged, and there's some screaming/yelling. Alexander sets some papers/posters on fire during a science experiment, and his dad sets his sleeves on fire at a hibachi restaurant. Dad Ben chases after an escaped kangaroo and gets kicked in the chest. Ben opens the door to his house, and an alligator snaps at him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Anthony wants to get his driver\u2019s license so he can make out with his girlfriend in the back of his parents\u2019 minivan on prom night. He tells his girlfriend she has a \"cute butt.\" Alexander\u2019s dad accidentally hires three male strippers for Alexander\u2019s birthday party thinking that the \"Thunder from Down Under\" is an act for kids; the dancers are told to keep things tame just in time. A chaste kiss; a baby's naked behind is seen. The mom walks in on her teen son in the bathroom; nothing is shown, but it's clear she's seen him naked.\n|Language|: Words used include \"butt,\" \"crap,\" \"idiot,\" \"pee,\" \"shut up,\" \"OMG,\" \"sucks,\" \"boobs,\" \"penis,\" and \"butt thong.\" The adults say things like \"oh sh...\" and \"oh mother!\" but don't complete any profanities.\n|Products & Purchases|: Mac computers and iPhones are seen/used. Trader Joe's is mentioned. A character references Gossip Girl. Anthony is called Wreck-It Ralph, referencing another popular Disney movie.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Suffering from a cold, Alexander's 13-year-old sister drinks cough medicine straight from the bottle (in front of her dad) to get through a school play and ends up drunk on stage; she eventually throws up.

She also talks about having to learn to do what's right. The caterpillar makes Alice think about who she is and how she can \"grow\" to meet the challenges that Wonderland throws her way. The walrus says \"nothing is impossible.\" Alice stands up to the tyrannical queen.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alice is a role model for perseverance. She doggedly finds a way to get out of Wonderland, but not before she defends what\u2019s right. She also demonstrates curiosity by going down the hole and eating and drinking strange foods that could be dangerous\n|Violence & Scariness|: Alice nearly drowns in her own tears. In one sequence, oysters are lured to a kitchen, where they're killed. The enchanted flowers throw Alice out of the garden, thinking she's a weed. Alice grows so tall she nearly destroys Rabbit's house. The Queen of Hearts is a murderous tyrant and frequently sentences her subjects (and Alice) to death, shouting \"Off with her head!\" dozens of times. During Alice's show-trial, the Queen says \"sentence first, verdict later.\" She sets her army of cards to chase after Alice.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Characters (usually Alice) use mild insults like \"barbarian,\" \"stupidest,\" \"poo,\" and \"fat, pompous, bad-tempered old tyrant.\" The enchanted flowers call Alice a \"weed.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The Caterpillar is shown smoking a hookah in every scene he's in.

This trippy adaptation -- in which Alice is a young adult -- includes some fantasy violence with scary monsters that attack people, a cruel Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who frequently sentences people to death, and a climactic battle scene between sword-brandishing humans, animals, and beasts. Some parents might want to know that a caterpillar (played by Alan Rickman) smokes a hookah, but this is as Lewis Carroll depicted the character. The language includes taunting insults like \"stupid,\" \"imbecile,\" \"idiot,\" \"bloody,\" and the like, and the sexuality is limited to one kiss between a married man and another woman and some aggressive flirting.\n|Positive Messages|: The Red Queen's cruelty, jealousy, and insecurity end up costing her everything, proving that she's wrong when she asserts that it's \"better to be feared than to be loved.\" Alice and her Underland friends are all loyal to each other and to the cause of overthrowing the evil Red Queen -- all are willing to make sacrifices to ensure that the Red Queen is defeated. Alice confirms the belief that to dream, to believe in the impossible, to believe in your own abilities and potential, is actually a very wise thing to do.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alice, like all heroes, must learn to believe in herself to finally defeat the Jabberwocky and save Underland from the tyranny of the Red Queen. She's an excellent example to young girls, because she doesn't follow her sister and mother's advice to rely on her looks to land a high-class husband. Instead, she trusts her instincts and confronts her fears to emerge a powerful champion, a courageous defeater of evil, a friend and ally to an entire world. And when she returns to regular London, she makes a decision that goes against cultural norms of her day, but that is ultimately much better for her future.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Red Queen is quite bloodthirsty and frequently sentences people to death, yelling \"Off with their heads!\" She makes comments like \"I love morning execution, don't you?\" and sends scary creatures to do her bidding. A scary dog-like creature called the Bandersnatch suddenly attacks, chasing and pouncing on the Tweedle twins. Since these sequences are in 3-D, they're especially intense. There's a moat filled with cut-off heads and potions filled with severed fingers. People are scratched and nearly killed, an executioner is shown about to lower the axe on someone, and in the end, a creature is decaptitated.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Alice catches her brother-in-law kissing a woman who's not his wife; Alice and Hamish dance, and he proposes to her. The Knave of Hearts pushes an overgrown Alice against a wall and says he likes her, because he likes \"largeness.\" The Red Queen acts smitten with the Knave of Hearts.\n|Language|: Mild taunts and insults like \"imbeciles,\" \"idiots,\" \"bloody\" (in the British sense), \"stupid,\" \"big head,\" \"lunatic,\" and \"fat.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: None in the movie, but like all Disney movies, there's plenty of related merchandise available.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Absalom the smoking caterpillar does just that -- smoke a hookah -- in three different scenes.

Although Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, and other main characters reprise their roles, Tim Burton isn't the director this time. While there are certainly moments of peril and fantasy violence -- including some close calls when key characters seem on the verge of death -- the sequel is actually less scary/bloodthirsty than its predecessor. There's one comical death (someone's time is literally up) and tense moments when it seems like the past, present, and future have been destroyed. Alice's courage and determination make her a force to be reckoned with, even though she's considered \"hysterical\" back in 19th-century England. Expect some insults along the lines of \"imbecile\" and \"stupid.\"\n|Positive Messages|: A girl/woman can do whatever she puts her mind to. Family and friends who will help protect you and love you unconditionally are extremely important.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alice is a courageous, determined, strong-willed young woman who bucks trends and works as a sea captain on her father's ship.

Language includes frequent use of words like \"s--t\" and \"a--hole,\" and there's a brief glimpse of adults drinking beer with meals. There's a little bit of mild peril when characters get stuck in potentially dangerous situations, as well as a few cartoonish pratfalls.\n|Positive Messages|: Although the movie's \"stalking\" theme is obviously negative, the movie's resolution makes it clear that if you have to stalk someone you love, they don't really love you. The fact that Steve is less interested in Mary after discovering how \"book smart\" she is also sends an iffy message.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ultimately, Mary realizes that she shouldn't have to change who she is for a man (she doesn't dumb down her behavior or change to be less quirky), but none of the characters is really a role model. Mary is a workaholic who transforms into an unprofessional, obsessed stalker. Steve is only too happy to sleep with a woman he hasn't said two words (until she proves herself too \"crazy smart,\" that is). The news reporters are only interested in ratings and beating their colleagues to juicy stories. Mary's brand-new friends are sweet, but the woman in particular seems ignorant.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A group of schoolchildren falls into a hidden mineshaft; later, a couple of main characters fall in, too. A tornado lifts up a car that a few characters just ran away from, and there are a few funny pratfalls by Mary and Steve.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mary basically attacks Steve during their first date. She and Steve are shown shirtless (she's wearing a bra) and make overt sexual references/gestures while making out as they're lying down in the backseat of a car. Although it's technically not a sex scene, the foreplay includes a few verbally explicit moments. Aside from that one scene, there are many conversations about romantic relationships and sexual comments and innuendo.\n|Language|: Language includes \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"p---y,\" as well as \"crap,\" \"dumbass,\" \"Christ!\" and tamer words like \"damn,\" \"hell,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Surprisingly few product placements, but there are a couple, including Twinkies.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink beer with meals in a couple of quick scenes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b78ad5437001f7a0871": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/all-creatures-big-and-small", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that All Creatures Big and Small is a European animated film that's also been known as Oops! Noah Is Gone and Two by Two. This animal-centric kids' film is loosely based on the Noah's Ark story, though it's from the animals' perspective and has almost no mention of Noah or religion. Fart and poop jokes are prevalent, including the detail that some characters fart a dark gas when nervous. There's a lot of slapstick violence and many suspenseful scenes showing characters trying to escape the flood or villains, which may be too intense for sensitive young viewers. There are also some dark themes, including one character's musings that \"maybe we're not all meant to survive\" that seem out of place in a children's film. Parents may also be concerned about the bullying shown, as some animals aren't deemed worthy to board the Ark or are taught to be cruel to other animals, though (SPOILER ALERT) it's eventually revealed they wouldn't need the Ark to survive after all and the bullies learn to play nice. But by the time these caveats are given it feels too little, too late. There is also a large character named \"Obesey,\" which seems in poor taste.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Friendship and working together are important. But even though there's a happy ending, the apocalyptic message that maybe we're not all meant to survive overshadows the positive messages. There's also a character questionably named \"Obesey.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Finny helps and supports everyone, regardless of species.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Flood threatens to destroy the whole world and any species not safe on the ark.

The dogs are parodies of Prohibition-era gangsters -- they smoke and drink, lie, cheat, steal, commit arson, and try to kill each other. Dogs are shown at the casino bar acting extremely drunk, falling over, passing out. The lead character dog is shown drunk and singing, and there's cigar smoking, including scenes in which the lead antagonist dog blows smoke in the face of a little orphan girl. This little girl has been kidnapped by dogs and forced to use her ability to communicate with animals to tell the dogs which animals are going to win at the races. This little orphan girl nearly drowns in flaming water in another scene. There's some potentially frightening imagery (demons pursue Charlie in a fiery nightmare) and some racial stereotyping: For a brief moment, one of the characters morphs into a racist caricature of an Asian.

Based on the first half of the final book in Veronica Roth's best-selling trilogy, the adaptation continues the saga of Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her partner in love and war, Four (Theo James). The violence is on par with the second film, but there's a conspicuous lack of blood, even during execution-style murders in which someone is shot at close range. There's slightly less romance in this one, with a few passionate kisses but no love scene; two nonsexual shower scenes show Tris' silhouetted nude backside and Four's bare chest. Strong language is infrequent but includes a few uses of \"s--t\" and \"ass.\" Tris, while still unfailingly courageous, makes a mistake this time by blindly trusting someone whom viewers will be able to tell is shady; Four continues to be a brave, if brooding, boyfriend to her. Readers, be aware: Many of the movie plot's details are quite different than in the book.\n|Positive Messages|: While previous films in the series dealt with identity and destiny, this installment explores issues of diversity and discrimination. Tris' crusade encourages people to look beyond what divides them and seek to work together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tris is (as always) courageous, but in this installment she's not very intuitive about others' intentions. Four is clear-headed and brave, but he's also hot-headed. Caleb redeems himself by finally being loyal to Tris as his only remaining family.  Tris and Four have a loving relationship in which they respect each other, even when they don't agree.\n|Violence & Scariness|: People die via gunshot wounds (including execution-style murders at close range), but there's a conspicuous lack of blood, so occasionally it's unclear whether characters have been killed or just left unconscious (in some cases, it's obvious, but in others it's ambiguous). Fist-fighting and vehicle crashes injure/kill characters. A serum/gas that erases people's memories is unleashed on the population, frightening them and immediately affecting some of them. Lots of danger/peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several kisses, a couple of them passionate. Four tells Tris: \"I wish we could be alone\" before an intense kiss. Two different shower scenes show brief silhouettes of Four's bare chest/back and Tris' entire back -- and then a dark shadow of her whole figure from the back.\n|Language|: A couple of uses of \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" and \"s--tless,\" plus insults like \"stiff,\" \"damaged,\" \"ass kisser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776ba3594b2b001e6df8e5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/almost-christmas", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Almost Christmas is an all-star ensemble holiday movie (stars include Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, and more) about a dysfunctional family celebrating their first Christmas after a sad loss. Although it centers on a family with three school-aged grandchildren, it's not really for kids. Mature themes include adultery, drug dependency, and grief, and language includes words like \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" and more. On the sex front, there's an affair between a married man and a woman he barely knows. Adults drink, but not overly so, and one character uses illegally obtained painkillers. Still, in the end the movie offers a positive message about forgiveness, family closeness, and the power of a strong legacy.\n|Positive Messages|: Clear messages about empathy and the importance of family unity despite superficial differences and past hurts, the powerful legacy that an incredible mother leaves her children, the value of siblings who look out for and help one another, and the significance of the holidays as a time for families to come together and heal.\n|Positive Role Models|: Walter is a wonderful father who's loving and supportive and encourages his children to make peace with one another. Aunt May wants to be with and emotionally support her brother-in-law and nieces/nephews during their first Christmas after her sister's death. The siblings all have their issues but realize what an important role they play in one another's lives.

In the end, teamwork saves the day.\n|Educational Value|: Some information about Hawaiian culture and mythology.\n|Positive Messages|: As usual for Scooby-Doo stories, the tenets of teamwork and friendship are strong. The idea that \"crime doesn't pay\" gets some play.

Characters are pretty stereotypical (nerd, beauty, hunk, dork...).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tiny monsters seem to be terrorizing the small Hawaiian village with spears, axes, or spiked clubs and people act afraid of the spirits.

While there's not much in the way of language, the movie does feature a few violent scenes in which snarling wolves are about to attack each other and one sequence in which the main wolves have to run away from angry bears chasing them (all of which iis made more intense by the 3-D). On the plus side, there's a girl empowerment theme and a positive message about marrying for love rather than duty, but families sensitive to innuendo may be put off by all the grown-up references.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn that relationships should be based on love rather than status and a bit about how wolf society is structured -- though it's not 100% accurate (in real life, omega wolves are often terrorized and forced to disperse, and they would never be allowed to mate, much less with an alpha).\n|Positive Messages|: Kate's character shows that the alpha female is powerful and important to the pack; she's not secondary just because she's female. Marrying for love is demonstrated as the ideal and is presented as more important than marrying for familial duty or societal obligation (though selfless Kate is willing to do whatever is necessary to unite the packs). Kate and Humphrey and Lily and Garth also teach kids that you should base friendships and relationships on personal compatibility rather than cultural status or popularity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Several of the characters act courageously: Kate, Humphrey, Lily, and the two chief alpha wolves. The goose and the duck are loyal friends to Kate and Humphrey. The alpha wolves are able to adapt to their offspring's decision to \"marry\" someone outside of \"pack law.\" Kate is a strong female character.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few scenes show snarling wolves posing aggressively, like they're about to attack. In one case, it's just a couple of wolves versus a couple of wolves, but toward the end of the movie, it's two entire wolf packs about to go to war, and they look fierce and frightening. Humphrey and Kate have to evade three angry bears. A stampede nearly kills some wolves (but they're saved). The mother alpha makes humorously off-putting threats about ripping anatomical parts off and shoving them down throats. The 3-D version of the movie makes these potentially frightening images more intense for younger viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of sexual innuendoes and jokes that will go over very young kids' head but that worldlier tweens may understand. For example: \"was it good for you\" after a male wolf shows off his howling skills; \"check out her moves\"; \"she's hot\"; \"you can't 'howl' together\"; and a drawn-out gag about an \"alpha\" male's limp, unimpressive howl. There are also continuous jokes about who can mate (although the word is never used as a verb) and why alphas and omegas can play together as kids but can never be together (it's the \"law of the pack\").\n|Language|: Language includes \"butt,\" \"dumb,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683085719b001f3a2a56": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/alvin-and-the-chipmunks", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that while this movie is mostly OK for little kids, there's some innuendo and sassy language that children might mimic.

They also tell Dave his music \"sucks.\" There's also a fair amount of slapstick/cartoonish violence. Female backup singers and partygoers wear tight, revealing clothes. But overall, it's a mild kids' movie -- albeit one that's mired in product placement and overcommercialism.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Family matters. Rules are good; always being able to do what you want isn't as fun as it seems.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dave learns that even chipmunks can become your family. The chipmunks discover that being loved and cared for by Dave is better than being treated like overworked rock stars.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dave angrily throws his music equipment out his door.

There's nothing overly troublesome in Chip-Wrecked, but young kids might be frightened when the Chipmunks wind up on the deserted island, especially when its lone inhabitant turns on them and captures a Chipette. Two of the chip-characters engage in an overt flirtation and (tame) romance; Alvin also tries to hit on a woman who's gambling at a casino, and the Chipettes wear notably short outfits. The movie's ultimate message is one of family and friendship, but it's a bit buried underneath the sense that the whole thing is a commercial for Chipmunks merchandise.\n|Educational Value|: This is not an educational movie -- it's strictly for entertainment purposes.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's most crucial positive message is that family means unconditional love, something Alvin doubts when he realizes that he's disappointed Dave again.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dave is a positive role model because he tirelessly tracks down the Chipmunks and saves them. The Chipmunks and Chipettes work together to find a way off the island.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's some mild peril and lots of slapstick. Theodore is frightened of a movie called Jungle Monster, which he shouldn't be watching. Young viewers might be upset when the chipmunks and then Dave and Ian are washed away toward the deserted island. A few precarious situations pose a danger to the characters, but no one is hurt (although a greedy island dweller captures Jeanette and forces her to locate hidden treasure).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's a love interest between the Chipmunks and the Chipettes -- particularly Simon and Jeanette. Simon is poisoned and winds up acting like an accented lothario, which leads him to romance Jeanette, hug her, and kiss her hand -- as well as save her from imminent danger. The other chipmunks insist that Simon and Jeanette went on a \"date.\" The Chipettes' routines feature some suggestive dance moves, and in one scene, they challenge a trio of human Jersey Shore-like caricatures and sing and dance provocatively. One song has lyrics like \"I wave my tail back and forth,\" which the girls sing while wearing just a towel. Eleanor sews outfits that would be considered \"sexy\" on a human. Alvin also flirts with a woman gambling at the cruise casino.\n|Language|: Occasional use of insulting comments like \"no you didn't!\" or \"little rodent\" or \"fat\" and \"pain in the ...\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The Carnival brand plays a prominent role, since it's the cruise line the Chimpunks are on before they go overboard. Other brands mentioned or shown include Swiss Army, YouTube video references, and Apple.

With the introduction of girl Chipmunk group The Chipettes comes some flirting and suggestive hip-wiggling (similar to that of sexy starlets like Beyonc\u00e9 and Shakira), which -- along with the infrequent use of phrases like \"junk in the trunk\" -- makes this sequel a little edgier than the original. But overall the movie focuses on family, togetherness, and acceptance and deals positively with school and peer pressure. Though the issue of body image comes up (at times, Theodore's weight is called to attention, as is that of his female counterpart, Eleanor), ultimately the message is one of liking yourself for who you are.\n|Educational Value|: Probably the most important lesson here is to avoid peer pressure and believe in yourself and/or your family, but it's not the movie's main focus.\n|Positive Messages|: Alvin learns to overcome his arrogance and need for acceptance -- i.e. joining the football team -- and fulfill his responsibilities to his family. Alvin's brothers refuse to perform without him because their act has always been about teamwork rather than any individual. Eleanor begins to feel bad about her body image but learns to accept herself the way she is. The evil talent agent and school bully are both humiliated as punishment for their behavior. The movie portrays video games as a means to avoid social interaction and family time.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alvin isn't an ideal role model, though he does learn his lesson and adjusts his arrogant behavior. None of the adult characters is really very admirable either, but Simon and Theodore continually show good, strong behavior -- they're the ones who emphasize family and call Alvin on his bad conduct. They also re-affirm confidence in personal body image, as well as cleanliness, politeness, and other positive attributes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Theodore develops a fear of being scooped up by an eagle, and there's some scary eagle imagery, but he eventually overcomes his fear. The movie has a jock bully in the high school scenes (with a couple of toilet \"swirly\" scenes), and there's an evil talent agent who locks his chipmunk clients in cages (though the scenes are all ultimately meant to be funny). Theodore feels alone and sad when Alvin and Simon argue, but the movie usually ends these moments with a humorous note.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The Chipettes perform their act with some suggestive hip-wiggling. The boy chipmunks and the girl chipmunks all develop crushes on one another, but nothing more than some googly eyes and a bit of mild flirting results (in one scene, Eleanor trips and falls into Theodore's arms). Among the human characters, Toby has a crush on a former schoolmate, but he's too shy to act on it. They hug at the end.\n|Language|: Use of cruel comments. Some uses of the word \"butt,\" and some \"fat\" jokes -- like \"junk in the trunk.\" One character calls another one a \"big jerk.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Featured brands/products include Apple computers and iPhones, FedEx, YouTube, and Animal Planet. Characters also spend some time playing Wii (though the movie's attitude toward playing video games is that it's a waste of time).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a961905001eb91f6c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-amazing-spider-man", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Amazing Spider-Man sticks pretty closely to the standard superhero template. There's an average guy (Andrew Garfield) who mysteriously receives amazing powers and is suddenly thrust into the unfamiliar role of savior, some tame romance (kissing, flirting), mild swearing (\"damn,\" \"hell\"),  and lots of comic book-style action -- cars getting thrown off bridges, villains throwing heroes through walls, and assorted other mayhem, some with weapons and a bit of blood. Popular actress Emma Stone co-stars as Spidey's love interest, and Martin Sheen adds gravitas in the tragic role of Peter Parker's kind Uncle Ben.\n|Positive Messages|: Much is expected from those to whom much is given (or, in other words, with great power comes great responsibility). That's the theme that pushes Spider-Man to take on the much stronger Lizard, with some concerns about his abilities, since nobody else really has the ability to stand up to the bad guy. Teamwork and collaboration play important roles, and love (familial, romantic) is a big theme of the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter Parker is really trying to do the right thing, but he often comes off as a classically immature teen -- self-absorbed, insensitive, and at times narcissistic. But that doesn't make him a bad guy; when it counts, he definitely comes through (although at the end it's not clear whether he plans to keep a very important promise). Gwen is a smart, independent young woman who, unlike many superhero movie female leads, doesn't need rescuing. Uncle Ben and Aunt May teach Peter the importance of responsbility and unconditional love.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of super-powered comic book-style action, including cars getting thrown off bridges, villains throwing heroes through walls, and assorted other mayhem. A mugging leaves a shot bystander bloody and dying, and Spider-Man's first crime-fighting efforts target other muggers, who are clearly outmatched and beaten badly. An NYPD assault team tries to take out both Spidey and The Lizard, using high-powered weapons that leave the web-slinger injured and bloody. The villain impales a cop with his long claws, leaving the officer critically injured. Some bullying among high school students.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting, and a few romantic kisses.\n|Language|: Infrequent swearing includes \"ass,\" damm,\" \"hell,\" \"suck up,\" \"oh my God,\" and the euphemistic \"Mother Hubbard,\" used as an expletive. Some insults -- \"stupid,\" \"loser,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise. A few scenes feature people searching the Internet on Microsoft's Bing browser and looking for medical information on WebMD.com.

Like most superhero-based action flicks, there's lots of city-wide violence and destruction of property (some of which is notably more intense when viewed in 3-D). While the crash-and-bang scenes may not scare experienced movie-going kids, there are some emotional deaths that are sad and upsetting for all ages, particularly to anyone who isn't familiar with the Spidey storyline. There's no drinking or sex to speak of (although Garfield and Stone have a strong chemistry that translates into a few passionate kisses) and very little language (\"damn,\" \"hell,\" etc.), so if your teen or mature tween Webslinger fan can handle the violence, they should be ready for this latest adventure.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has several worthy messages, but the biggest is simple: Hold on to hope, and instill hope in others whenever you're able. Peter struggles with his responsibilities as Spider-Man, but he's reminded of his desire to offer help to the people of New York.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter is a caring and loving nephew, boyfriend, and friend -- and obviously a selfless superhero when he's acting as Spider-Man. Gwen loves Peter not because of his superhero alter ego but because of his generous spirit.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Most of the violence is on a large scale: cop cars pile up, people are shot at, and Manhattan landmarks, including Times Square, tumble down -- but people don't seem to actually die or bleed, just get injured and run away. When seen in 3-D, some of these scenes feel more intense. There are a few upsetting deaths, particularly of people who love Peter Parker. Those scenes are the most disturbing. Spider-Man's run-ins with Rhino, Electro, and the Green Goblin result in violence, but only one has lasting impact on Peter or the audience. The scenes in which the Green Goblin transforms suggest that it's a very painful process.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses, embraces, and declarations of love.\n|Language|: Language is infrequent and limited to \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: There's a tie-in between Spider-Man and a whole host of merchandise: the comic book source material, games, apparel, figures, video games, and much more. As for product placements, all of the electronics in the movie are made by Sony.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b9896b655001fe16522": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/american-made", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that American Made is based on the true story of a CIA pilot (Tom Cruise) who doubled as a drug runner in the 1980s. Expect frequent strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" etc.) and a few sexual situations, plus brief nudity (a man moons his family, etc.). For a film about drugs, not much actual drug use is shown; characters do drink. And there's a non-graphic car bombing, but otherwise violence is more referred to and discussed than shown. Still, the tension and stress of the high-wire act the main character walks might be too intense for kids. But the main issue for parents may be whether a film this ironic is right for their family. It takes a bluntly, hilariously cynical view of 1980s American foreign policy and secret operations, as well as of the war on drugs itself.\n|Positive Messages|: This isn't a message film; it's far more about irony than morality, inclusiveness, etc. If anything, it's a cautionary tale against getting in over your head, but even that's a stretch.\n|Positive Role Models|: Positive role models are hard to find in a story in which just about every character is deeply flawed. Everyone is pretty much amoral, incompetent, murderous, or outright evil. But you still root for the main character.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of tension, but while the war on drugs and Central American insurgencies are the backdrop to the story, the related violence isn't shown (though it's taken seriously). A car bombing has an emotional impact on the characters/film, but it isn't graphic.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few instances of non-graphic sex, including in the pilot's seat of a plane in flight. Brief partial nudity (of a few folks) from behind, including the main character humorously mooning his family more than once.\n|Language|: Many uses of \"f--k\" and its variants. Also \"s--t,\" \"goddammit,\" \"c--t,\" \"pr--k,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" and more. \"P--sies\" is seen written twice.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Cocaine smuggling is at the heart of the story, but viewers don't see many drugs being used.

Content is mild overall. There's some drinking (all by characters of legal age) at bars, parties, and meals. Language includes a few jokes about Kurt's age, a couple of uses \"dang,\" and an unfinished \"son of a...!\" While there's no off-field violence, the story of how a child became blind could be upsetting, as could a scene of mass destruction in the aftermath of a tornado that tragically killed many people, including two of the movie's characters. While there are no overt love scenes, Kurt and Brenda kiss, canoodle, and make out several times. Families who watch can discuss the movie's themes of gratitude, perseverance, and teamwork. The movie is directed by the Erwin Brothers, who are best known for their faith-based movies, including I Can Only Imagine and I Still Believe; this one is more \"faith lite,\" but the main characters are committed Christians who believe in their faith's ability to guide their lives.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include the importance of gratitude, perseverance, and teamwork. Kurt Warner's story is one of not giving up, of believing in something greater than yourself, and in the power of transformational relationships. Also promotes the power of faith.\n|Positive Role Models|: Warner is portrayed as a man who's disciplined and loyal. He's committed to Brenda, despite their different life experiences and situations. He believes in his abilities and in his dream to play professional football. Brenda is self-confident, encouraging, and supportive. They both believe in God and in their Christian faith's ability to guide their lives.\n|Diverse Representations|: Kurt, his family, and most of his coaches are White. He has a couple of close friends/teammates/roommates who are Black. Brenda's young son, who is blind, is portrayed as having agency: He explores and plays and isn't limited by his blindness.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Upsetting scene of the aftermath of a disastrous tornado that destroyed an entire community and killed lots of people, including two characters. Discussion of how a baby is injured due to head trauma. Football action.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brenda and Kurt flirt, dance, and, once they're together, kiss passionately and make out several times. When Kurt stays with Brenda's family, he stays in a different room.\n|Language|: Language includes \"dang\" and an unfinished \"son of a...,\" plus some insults: \"old man,\" \"green,\" \"rookie,\" \"pop.\" \"Oh my God\" and \"God\" used as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brief glimpses of vehicles like Ford trucks.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink (usually beer) at dinners, and empty bottles and cans are visible in Kurt and Mike's apartment.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d1951dd69001fe3fe87": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/anastasia", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Anatasia is a very romantic, fun, animated fairy tale about a long-lost princess and her quest to find her family and rightful place in history, but it's intercut with scenes in which the evil Rasputin attempts to kill the young heroine. Thus, Anastasia and her helpmates are often in great danger (i.e., a runaway train, a fall into a raging sea). In many of the villain-centered scenes (which young or very sensitive kids might find scary) Rasputin's body comes apart and he's surrounded by green bats, dark music, and crashing noise.\n|Educational Value|: Beautiful animation depicts simple sights, sounds, and culture of Europe in the early 20th century. The movie shows the geographical connection between Paris and Moscow, as well. Though based on overthrown Romanov royalty at the time of the Russian Revolution, this tale of Anastasia is a fairy tale rather than factual.\n|Positive Messages|: Fairy tales can come true. Goodness and perseverance are rewarded. Evil is destroyed by courage, honesty, and doing the right thing. Life is full of choices; make good ones and never give up hope.\n|Positive Role Models|: Anastasia is a thoroughly modern, courageous role model for girls. She's feisty, honest, stands up for herself at all costs, and is effective even in the most dangerous of physical pursuits. Dimitri, the young hero, is her equal and they work together to achieve their goals. Though Dimitri is not 100 percent honest early on, his true goodness and loyalty surface by the finale.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Anastasia faces a powerful enemy (often appearing as a rotting corpse) who has placed a mighty curse on her and her family. Cartoon danger in several sequences: the fiery destruction of a castle and its surroundings; a runaway train on fire, as it heads for a crumbling bridge; the heroine sleepwalking on a ship in torrential rains, precariously in danger of being thrown into the sea. After a scary attack, Anastasia believes Dimitri is dead, but he awakens almost immediately. In one scene the young princess slaps her \"prince charming\" in anger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young woman and a young man fall in love over the course of the film, kiss at the end.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768322ec6b5001f6bb5cc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/anchorman", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although your kids may love Will Ferrell, this is not Elf.

The movie has comic peril and violence. One character's arms are hacked off and others are killed.\n|Positive Messages|: Tolerance is a theme of the movie, but there is very little racial diversity within the cast to support this.\n|Positive Role Models|: The men act like buffoons, but it is played all for laughs.

Like those, the story centers on a foreign plot to kill the American president, with Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) ready to protect and serve. Also like the other two, Angel Has Fallen has constant graphic violence: Hundreds of (largely faceless) people are killed in multiple extended battle scenes with military weaponry and aircraft, and sympathetic characters are suddenly dispatched on-screen. Bodies are set on fire, fly through the air, and lie burned on the ground with missing limbs. Dozens of explosions take out many people at the same time; there are also scenes in which people battle while driving, with cars and trucks smashing into things and each other. Nobody shows any remorse, nor are there many consequences for the deaths. Language is frequent and quite salty, including \"f--k,\" \"a--hole,\" \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\" Banning is frequently praised for being brave and strong, but the movie mostly shows him being brutal. He's tender to his wife and child, but they mostly serve as a symbol for what he leaves behind when he heads off on a mission. Women are almost absent from the movie overall, though Jada Pinkett-Smith plays an FBI investigator.\n|Positive Messages|: Lip service is paid to courage and integrity, but those messages are muddled because both villains and heroes use exact same brutal methods. Movie also doesn't seem to care about collateral damage: At one point, a hospital is blown up, and it's never mentioned how many patients, doctors, nurses, other people were killed, just that a few characters are safe.\n|Positive Role Models|: Banning is true to his word, works hard to protect his family and the administration he's hired to guard. But it's hard to consider him a role model when he's blowing up, shooting, stabbing, and/or strangling so many. His relationship with his father, though, is relatable and humanizing. Women are almost absent; although Jada Pinkett-Smith plays a high-ranking FBI agent and Piper Perabo is Banning's wife, neither is given much to do.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Nonstop, super-intense mayhem and violence. People are hit with grenades, other explosive devices; many, many bodies fly through the air, are on fire. People are shot; usually they just fall to the ground, but sometimes viewers see spattering or pooling blood. People are hit by cars, stabbed, strangled; a hospital is blown up, presumably causing an enormous number of deaths. Many scenes are filled with high-tech weaponry, military aircraft, advanced guns. Vehicles crash into each other, skid down the road, burst into flames. Character bludgeoned in front of a small child, who screams and cries. Deaths are usually of identically dressed soldiers whose faces are obscured by helmets/masks, but some sympathetic characters are killed suddenly on-screen.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Married characters kiss affectionately.\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"a--hole,\" \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink at gatherings; no one acts drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684eeb5d26001f1e5705": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/angels-in-the-outfield", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this film has a few mild swear words and one mild fistfight.

As you might expect, there are plenty of scenes of birds being kicked, punched, and hurled through the air, as well as explosions. Eggs are stolen from their parent birds and put in peril, and their parents are visibly upset. There's also some drinking (out of coconuts, etc.) and few sexual situations/innuendoes (which will likely go over many kids' heads), including an unpleasant Peeping Tom scene. Language includes \"idiot,\" \"weirdos,\" quite a few \"butt\" jokes, and cursing stand-ins like \"pluck my life.\" Although there's only one main female character, the movie has some messages about taking responsibility and not judging others. But mostly its goal is to be funny -- putting it squarely in the category of movies that kids will like and parents will tolerate.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but there are mild lessons about taking responsibility and not judging others.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't judge people before you know their story. Everyone has something to offer society. It's important to take responsibility for your actions.\n|Positive Role Models|: A mixed bag. Main character Red punches and mocks people, destroys things, and has a bad attitude. But even though no one believes him and he has no friends, he still acts bravely and fights to save the island and rescue the eggs. The eagle is a cowardly blowhard who pees in the Lake of Wisdom, but he eventually comes around and helps save the day. Even though there are many birds and pigs, there's only one main female character. The king of the pigs lies, steals, and destroys.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Chase scenes, explosions, and birds being thrown into buildings. Birds and pigs are punched, kicked (including a baby bird), and shoved. Eggs are kidnapped and almost dropped into boiling water; parents cry about the lost eggs. A door opens to show twin pigs in matching outfits that say \"redrum.\" Piggy planes attack birds. Red says to remember him when he's gone, and at one point it seems he might be dead. A bird couple cries when they think their egg has died.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An eagle looks through a telescope at a bird taking a bath. When the birds are kidnapped, a bird says they can be replaced and suggests that \"ladies get busy\" laying eggs. Plungers are attached to a pig's chest, and the pig shakes them like breasts. It's pointed out that the pigs are naked. Two birds flirt and snuggle.\n|Language|: No actual swearing, but stand-ins like \"pluck my life,\" plus insults like \"idiot\" and \"weirdos\" and quite a few \"butt\" jokes.\n|Products & Purchases|: Angry Birds is based on the wildly popular app that already has tons of merchandise associated with it, including clothing, toys, and much more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A bird is in a bar and says, \"drinks on me.\" There's a party scene where everyone is drinking out of coconuts.

As in the original, there's a lot of silliness here, as well as some mildly rude and suggestive jokes. But there's also a focus on teamwork, courage, and communication. Now that Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) has won the trust and admiration of his fellow birds, he's no longer the titular angry bird -- that title belongs to a new threat: Zeta (Leslie Jones). This movie improves on the original's messages and storyline, but it still has plenty of the butt jokes, endangered eggs, and physical comedy that made the first movie so popular. There are a few mildly eyebrow-raising jokes about mating season, naked pigs, and speed-dating. A few scenes make it clear that animals are in danger, but (spoiler alert?) everything turns out just fine for everyone. It's likely to appeal to mid-elementary-school-aged kids and tweens.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but it does teach teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Focuses on teamwork, redemption, diplomacy, courage. Encourages individuals to see past former failures and work for the common good. Emphasis on taking responsibility, asking for forgiveness, communicating, moving forward.\n|Positive Role Models|: Red reluctantly learns to work with others and that he doesn't always have to be the only hero for others to like and respect him. He values Silver's ideas. Zeta's true motivations for being cruel are revealed; once they're dealt with, she apologizes and redeems herself. Mighty Eagle has courage to face up to his past failures. The little birds are brave to save their egg siblings.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Little hatchlings have to save three \"baby sisters\" (eggs) from danger and peril on multiple occasions.

Explosions and pranks momentarily injure or scare birds and/or pigs.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Jokes about mating season. Two birds flirt and eventually get together, hugging briefly.

It moves fast, with a busy story and lots of imaginative, quirky characters to follow. There's a jealous, bullying villain who wants to take back the circus he abandoned years earlier and will do anything to make it happen. Action includes chases, falls, wild rides/crashes, fierce animals fighting, and a threatening mythic monster. A fire, shown from a distance, destroys the big tent, presumably with the owners inside. Insults used include \"nincompoop,\" \"nitwit,\" \"sap,\" \"fool,\" and \"feather-brain.\" While there are messages of perseverance and teamwork and some ethnic diversity, viewers will also see a couple of stereotypical/farcical characters (a circus fat lady, a clown who overeats, a gypsy) and a few skimpy costumes. The movie is recommended for kids who can distinguish between real and pretend violence.

There's lots of bloody horror, splattering blood, and scary images, plus some jump-shock moments, shooting, fighting, and dead bodies. A pregnant woman and, later, a small child are in jeopardy. It's all pretty terrifying. But on the upside, other than the scary/gory stuff, there's not too much other iffy content of note -- no sex, strong language, alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs. Though the central couple is married and affectionate, they're very rarely physical onscreen (not much beyond a hug or a kiss). And since the movie is set in the 1960s, not many brand names are shown. Horror fans will probably want to see this, but it's not likely to be as big as The Conjuring was.\n|Positive Messages|: Basically the movie is about misfortune; bad things randomly happen to good people. But the good people do get certain chances to help out in big ways.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although there are lots of decent characters -- loving couples, helpful neighbors, hard workers -- who are all generally polite and caring, they don't have many chances to prove themselves, and their goodness doesn't heavily apply to the plot.

Overall, it's a charming and entertaining family movie that's full of memorable songs. Annie (Aileen Quinn) and her friends demonstrate courage, gratitude, and perseverance in tough situations. But Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), who runs the ramshackle orphanage where intrepid, determined Annie lives, is often drunk, slurring her speech and clutching bottles of liquor in a way that's intended to be funny. She's also cruel to the children in her care. There's kissing, flirting, and occasional references to sex (\"make hay,\" \"tumble with the bundle\"). Things never get too scary, but someone throws a lit bomb into an office, and some tense scenes show Annie hanging from a bridge after being kidnapped and chased. Women have stereotypical jobs like secretary and maid but are important in the story. The movie also includes racist stereotyping in the form of bodyguards Punjab (Geoffrey Holder) and The Asp (Roger Minami) and promotes the \"rags to riches\" idea of the American dream, which is idealized and not achievable by all.\n|Educational Value|: The film is intended to entertain, rather than educate, but kids may learn a little about the Depression and New York City in the 1930s.\n|Positive Messages|: Families can be based on more than blood relationships. Loyalty and friendship are strong themes, as are courage, gratitude, and perseverance. Promotes the \"rags to riches through determination\" idea of the American dream, which is idealized and not achievable for all.\n|Positive Role Models|: Annie displays grit, determination, and optimism as she tries to make the best of her situation. Sometimes she tries to solve problems by fighting but does better when she shows kindness to others. Her friends are loyal to her, and Daddy Warbucks and Grace grow to love her and want to help her. Grace demonstrates a strong moral code by insisting Annie stay with them. On the downside, Miss Hannigan is irresponsible and conniving, and Rooster and Lily tell lies, steal, and try to cheat Daddy Warbucks. They care more about money than Annie's safety or happiness.\n|Diverse Representations|: The only non-White characters are Daddy Warbucks' bodyguards, \"Punjab,\" played by Black Trinidadian American Geoffrey Holder, and \"The Asp,\" who is East Asian (Hawaiian actor Roger Minami). Grace treats them with respect and they're good at their jobs, but both are portrayed in racist ways: They're servants, generic \"Eastern-sounding\" music plays around them, and they're insensitively named (\"Punjab\" is a region in India, and \"asp\" is a generic term for a poisonous snake). Punjab plays into clich\u00e9 of \"magical\" Eastern cultures by having mind control, healing, and levitation powers. On the plus side, the film tackles wealth inequality by contrasting Annie's poor living conditions with Daddy Warbucks' \"billionaire\" lifestyle. Adoption and non-parent caretakers are represented as good ways to form strong, loving families. Women have stereotypical jobs like secretary and maid, but girls and women are important heroes and villains in the story. President Roosevelt uses a wheelchair, and some domestic workers have different body sizes, although most characters are thin. Film minimizes and makes light of the seriousness of alcohol addiction.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Peril: Annie hangs from a bridge after being kidnapped and chased by a man who's trying to hurt her. Someone throws a lit bomb into Daddy Warbucks' office. Miss Hannigan often shoves the children around and is generally cruel to them by denying them food and sleep and threatening them. Children get in a few fistfights and sing about forcing Miss Hannigan to drink a drugged beverage. Annie stops a group of boys from harming a dog that Miss Hannigan later threatens to send to the \"sausage factory.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing and insinuations between Lily and Rooster. Flirting from Miss Hannigan, including the phrases \"make hay\" and a \"tumble with the bundle.\"\n|Language|: \"Goddamn.\" Children are referred to as \"pig droppings\" and \"brats.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Miss Hannigan often appears drunk, slurring her speech and clutching bottles of alcohol.

Compared to High School Musical, the dance moves are just slightly sexier, and there's a little kissing between teens. Also, girls fawn all over a teen heartthrob to an embarrassing extent, even rubbing up against him suggestively in public. A Zune music player figures prominently in the plot, and the wicked stepmother likes her martinis. The mean behavior directed at the main character is typical of her Cinderella role and played as over the top for laughs.\n|Positive Messages|: Not the helpless heroine message you usually get from Cinderella stories.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mary is not a typical helpless Cinderella, and she charms Joey by being herself. Joey defies his money-grubbing parents to get the girl. The stepmother figure, Dominique, is supposed to be over-the-top, and she gets enough laughs that there's no taking her bad behavior seriously, even though Mary is expected to do her bidding at every moment. Twins Britt and Bree try to make Mary's life miserable, but they seem pretty pathetic themselves. Joey's conniving ex-girlfriend Natalia is truly mean until the very end.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A mention that Mary's mother, who was one of Dominique's dancers, died before Dominique took her in. A couple of empty threats by Tami to the twin \"step sisters\" and Dustin in defense of Mary. Someone falls off a stage and ends up with two broken legs.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses between teens. Girls -- and some boys -- fawn all over teen singer Joey Parker; one girl kisses him in the school hallway, another asks him if he wants to make out, and others rub up against him and embarrass themselves to get his attention. Mary and Joey hang out alone together in her room and almost kiss on her bed. A mention by Dominque that some talk-show hosts had grabby hands. Some slightly sexy dancing moves.\n|Language|: Pretty mild. One \"damn,\" and someone says \"frickin'\" a few times in a row.\n|Products & Purchases|: The Zune music player figures prominently in the story. Mary's friend Tami drives a VW bus. Plenty of celeb-lifestyle shout-outs, including TMZ, the VMAs, E Hollywood True Story, Dr. Phil, TiVo, and YouTube.

There's definitely plenty of action/sci-fi violence -- from fist fights to shoot-outs to a few gory deaths in which the human (or animal) victim turns into gelatinous goo -- but overall this adventure is on the tamer end of the Marvel movie scale. Occasional bursts of language (mostly \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and \"damn\") are peppered throughout the dialogue, and there are a couple of suggestive jokes/references, but there's only one (brief) kissing scene and very little drinking. The hero and his young daughter are sometimes separated, which could upset younger kids, but she's never in extended peril. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, this action adventure is full of humor, with some edgy jokes that will go over younger kids' head.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages forgiveness and redemption. Flawed characters, particularly Hank and Scott, are given an opportunity to redeem themselves for past mistakes. As with most superhero movies, teamwork, courage, and trust are also valued.\n|Positive Role Models|: Scott/Ant-Man and Dr. Pym are flawed men with uneven pasts, but each seeks redemption by doing what's right. They both love their daughters and want to protect them/be there for them. Hope is a strong, capable, successful woman who isn't easily impressed by charm or wealth. Paxton is a good cop who lives by the law and loves Maggie and Cassie. The trio of thieves may be ex-con robbers, but they step up to help Scott and Dr. Pym.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent sci-fi/action violence. Weapons include a gun that the villain uses to kill people by disintegrating them into gory goo (in one case, he just flushes what's left of the person down the toilet). During scientific testing, scientists end up killing sheep as they attempt to shrink them. A beloved ant is killed. Many people are shot at during a long stand-off, and one person seems on the verge of death. Fist fights leave bloody bruises. People crash into things. At one point the villain grabs a child, but she's not in extended danger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing. An adult woman sits on top of her boyfriend whispering and laughing in his ear. A couple of women are referred to as \"hot\" in suggestive ways. A man refers to a woman as the \"first pair of boobs I ever touched.\"\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hat,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"idiot.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Baskin Robbins (and one of their smoothies) is heavily featured in one scene.

It takes place between the events of Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War and is less intense and less violent than either of those films. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, who's under house arrest and at odds with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) as the movie opens. The biggest issue here is the action violence; there's plenty of it, though not on the scale of many other Marvel movies. Still, you can expect frequent peril/danger, hand-to-hand combat (with weapons including guns and knives), abductions, and destructive chase sequences. Children are shown hurt, sad, and losing their parents in flashback, and people are injured, but (spoiler alert) no major characters are killed. Language isn't frequent but includes \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and \"damn\"; on the romance front, there are a few quick kisses between established couples. Like the original, this is a fun, lightweight Avengers adventure, with lots of jokes and less death and destruction. It also promotes forgiveness, redemption, courage, and teamwork -- and marks the first time a female superhero has been included in the title of a Marvel film.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the original, the sequel promotes forgiveness, redemption, teamwork.

Hope is a strong, capable, successful woman who isn't easily impressed by charm or wealth (her Wasp is the first female Marvel hero to earn title billing). Paxton is a good cop and a loving stepfather/husband. Scott adores his daughter, Cassie, who's a clever, curious, and brave girl. Janet van Dyne is a brilliant scientist and devoted mother/wife. Ava is a complex villain whose situation will inspire sympathy, if not full support.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent sci-fi/action violence, with chases and pursuits that put major characters in peril. Large-scale crashes, destruction, as well as one-on-one/group fights with injuries. Weapons used include blasters, guns, knives, pots and pans, flames, and more. A couple races against time to stop a missile from exploding. A woman is used as a human weapon. Giant ants attack people; sympathetic ants are eaten by seagulls. Flashbacks show young girls upset/in peril -- one who's sad when her mother leaves and, later, dies (offscreen), and another who ends up in constant pain/mortal danger after trying to save her doomed father (both parents are briefly shown dead). Threats.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two kissing scenes between established couples. Flirting/loaded looks. Scott is shirtless in the bath.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"badass,\" \"ass,\" \"goddammit,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"for Christ's sake,\" \"Jeez,\" \"Jesus,\" \"oh my God,\" \"for God's sake,\" \"hell,\" \"screwed,\" \"hate,\" \"idiot,\" \"jerk,\" \"dumb.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands/products featured prominently include Altoids, Pez (Hello Kitty), Entemann's, Hyundai Veloster, Cadillac Escalade, Hot Wheels, Mercedes Benz, Dell computers, The Fault in Our Stars.

That metaphor may connect with teens, but it will likely be lost on younger kids, who may also be upset by the movie's sadder scenes. Spoiler alert: It's not just a dog who dies in this movie, but also the loving mother of a young child, who first suffers a prolonged illness and is shown bald, weak, and vomiting. While the film suggests some beautiful ways to think about death and says that there's nothing to fear, you're still going to cry. Fears of parental separation could also arise for some kids: The villains here are the grandparents who \"just want what's best\" for their 8-year-old granddaughter, and they use their money, false allegations, and the court system to take her away from her dad. All of that said, the film has fantastic messages about the bumpy road of life, and it shows why dogs are such wonderful support animals. Milo Ventimiglia stars, with Kevin Costner as the voice of his loyal dog, Enzo.\n|Positive Messages|: \"Rain\" in title is a metaphor for life's most difficult challenges; to get through them, you must \"create your own conditions\" so that when it rains, you can control your reactions to keep driving, keep racing, come out victorious. Lots of quotable wisdom using racing analogies: \"No race has ever been won in the first corner, but many have been lost there.\" \"There is no dishonor in losing the race; the only dishonor is not racing because you are afraid to lose.\" Themes also include communication, curiosity, empathy, integrity, teamwork. Wealthy characters act superior, use their money to influence the legal system. The dog monologues \"People are generally not satisfied with what they have; they are very concerned with what they are going to have.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Denny is a fantastic role model: He's kind, patient, thoughtful. He puts his family above his career, he's a loving father (to both his daughter and his dog), and he respects others' wishes. When life gets difficult, he doesn't let it affect who he is as a person, but fights for what's important. Minor supporting characters have positive ethnic representations.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two men argue, which leads to a minor accident. Spoiler alert: Moments of sadness/separation/loss that may be upsetting or spark fear: A child's loving mother is stricken with cancer and dies; immediately after, the child is separated from her father for an extended period of time with the threat of it being permanent. A dog dies.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple falls in love, gets married, starts a family: They kiss on several occasions. Before they're married, they're seen in bed (no graphic nudity, nothing sexy happening) in the morning.\n|Language|: \"Hell,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"for Christ's sake.\" A dog is called \"lazy\" and \"bad.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Set in the world of auto racing, where sponsorships are plastered everywhere. Continental and Katerra are predominant, plus car brands -- particularly BMW. Ferrari is portrayed as the best. Historical Formula One footage often shows the Marlboro logo.

It's based on a 2002 children's book Arthur and the Minimoys. There's some cartoonish action violence. After Arthur has been made tiny enough to find the ant-sized Minimoys, there are sword fights, battles with bad guys flying mosquitoes, and a car chase in which Arthur races a model car through tunnels to avoid an impending flood. The grandmother is drugged with sleeping drops so she doesn't catch Arthur sneaking out of the house. Some flirtation between Arthur and the princess.\n|Positive Messages|: No real positive messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: Arthur is a creative, imaginative, and innovative boy who comes up with interesting inventions and daring solutions to the problems he and his friends face throughout the movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some cartoonish/action violence.

One brief scene of a group of startled wild animals and another of an angry homeowner wielding a gun may frighten very young kids, and there are a few jokes targeting parents -- like when Grandsanta explains that \"in the old days,\" he once gave a double whiskey to an elf. But otherwise this movie from the British animators behind Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit provides a good reminder of the holiday spirit, family unity, and being generous. Families that don't celebrate Christmas should know that the story doesn't have any religious overtones; the emphasis remains on Santa and his family.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about the English tradition of \"Father Christmas\" and will briefly see how Christmas is celebrated around the world when Arthur and Grandsanta make their way to England in search of one little girl.\n|Positive Messages|: Arthur's story is an example of how one person can really make a difference and why families should work together. Arthur and Bryony also exemplify rising to the occasion and overcoming fears. Christmas, the movie suggests, is about the joy of feeling of loved and appreciated. There's also a worthwhile message about finding a balance between technology and tradition, especially during the holidays.\n|Positive Role Models|: Arthur is a wonderful example of someone who rises to the occasion to fight for what he believes in, overcome his fears, and help others. He's generous and kind and believes every child deserves to feel special and loved for Christmas. Grandsanta starts out acting selfishly but redeems himself toward the end of the movie, as do the other adult characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An encounter with wild animals in Africa could frighten younger viewers; the lions look especially ready to pounce. A dog is another formidable obstacle to delivering a gift. In one scene, a homeowner gets out of his house and fires a gun at Arthur, Grandsanta, and Bryony, mistaking them for aliens; in another, missiles are fired at Grandsanta's sleigh, and it bursts into flames. Some of the sleigh rides themselves are a little perilous, especially when the police are involved, and there's a fair bit of military flavor to some of the goings-on. Physical comedy gags include clumsy Arthur always falling and tripping into things, being afraid of heights, and otherwise wreaking havoc on the elves' world.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: The word \"hell\" is said.

It has fairly sophisticated themes (grief, loss, and war), as well as plenty of cartoon action violence -- including the death of a child, the destruction of several robots, explosions, and robots armed with heavy artillery. But language is limited to mild insults like \"idiot,\" and there's no product placement to worry about. A war-obsessed military man is presented as a humorously negative character; on the opposite end of the political spectrum is a trio of revolutionary robots who call each other \"comrade\" and have a poster of Lenin in their meeting place.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn about inclusiveness through the orphans and their early acceptance of Astro Boy, as well as about mustering the courage to defend others through Astro Boy's actions.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite the fact that Dr. Tenma does something clearly unethical by creating a robot with his dead son's memories, the movie has several positive messages. Cora's ability to forgive Astro Boy for not revealing that he's a robot shows kids that it's his character -- not his \"parts\" -- that make him a good friend. And Astro Boy's decision to bravely put himself in danger because he's the only one who can fight the negative energy is an example of selflessly overcoming obstacles and accepting your own responsibility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although the hawkish Metro City General and his cronies are basically warmongerers, most of the role models are positive. Dr. Tenma redeems himself by saving Astro Boy, and Astro Boy himself acts bravely and selflessly to stop the negative-energy killer robot. Cora is also a positive role model, as she's not a damsel-in-distress type but rather a confident, capable girl.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A lot of weapon-based explosions and disasters when the \"negative energy\" is unleashed. Several robots are destroyed throughout the movie, most of them a bit comically during their Coliseum-like battles to the \"death.\" A child dies (off screen).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Astro Boy and Cora flirt mildly, but it's not more than a couple of looks and a hug.\n|Language|: Characters occasionally say mildly insulting words like \"idiot\" and \"stupid,\" and there are a couple of jokes about weapons growing out of Astro Boy's \"butt\" and the \"sudden release\" of a robot's \"bodily fluids.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768354de0ee001fccb936": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/atlantis-the-lost-empire", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this movie is scarier and more intense than much Disney animated fare, with larger-than-life scenes of mass destruction (by crushing tidal wave, sea monsters, molten lava, and more). There are also lots of dive-bombing planes and guns, a huge robot monster, fire, and the deaths of hundreds of anonymous sailors. Characters are mean to each other, and some betray each other. Major characters are in peril, and some are killed. One character is a chain-smoker, and there are jokes about whiskey and sleeping in the nude.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate. The myth of Atlantis is sure to be intriguing to kids, but some clarification might be needed in terms of its true place in history.\n|Positive Messages|: Though Milo is trying to save a culture that's been living in peace for centuries, his colleagues have no problem destroying the city and its inhabitants for the sake of material gain. There are examples of both multicultural teamwork and greedy, violent behavior.\n|Positive Role Models|: While Milo is a positive character who's doing his best to preserve a culture, Rourke starts out as a strong leader but in the end is shown to be a ruthless mercenary who cares very little about human worth. The explorers hire Milo under the pretext that they're finding Atlantis for adventure's sake, but they're really in it for the money, which causes them to betray Milo and the people of Atlantis.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Edgier and darker than much Disney fare. There are apocalyptic scenes of mass destruction and large weapon caches, which include dynamite, nitroglycerin, machine guns, various hand guns, grenades, torpedoes, and more. All of these weapons are used at various points of the movie. Hundreds of shipmates are killed when they suffer an attack by a giant monster. Rourke punches the village elder and ultimately causes his death. Lots of explosions, a fight with an ax, a bad guy is chopped up by a blade, and there's an attempt to commit genocide.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Revealing clothes worn by some female characters make the males bashful.

Still, it does try to question those predictable assumptions somewhat and is buoyed by strong performances. Jane Austen fans will particularly enjoy the inside jokes and references to her work. There's not much language (except for \"crap\") and no drinking (though one character acts drunk), but you can expect some kissing and heavy flirting (as befits a movie with an Austen theme).\n|Positive Messages|: Love -- and life -- doesn't follow the trajectory of books (or movies, for that matter). Women don't need rescuing; neither do men. All you can do is be true to yourself, and if something, and someone, is meant to be, so be it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jane is really appealing as a heroine. She's relatable, understandable, and vulnerable, yet she stands up for herself and is open to a world full of possibilities, romance, and friendship. She doesn't lose hope.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two men get into a fight at an airport; a man forces himself on a woman, but she trips him up and stops him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couples kiss, sometimes passionately, often tenderly; some sexual innuendo/suggestive dialogue.\n|Language|: \"Crap\" is about the extent of it.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One character is lecherous and seems drunk all the time.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d057a53e9001e74ed5d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/avatar", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is about humans colonizing the planet Pandora, home to the Na'vi. The movie is long (at 161 minutes) and intense, with several effects-heavy battle and hunting sequences that show the devastation of imperialist violence and the right that Indigenous groups have to protect themselves and their land. These scenes include missile-launching military aircraft, neurotoxin-laced arrows, scary Pandora-dwelling fauna and flora, and lots of explosions. Salty wartime language includes many uses of \"s--t,\" \"\u200b\u200bbitch,\" and more. As in his previous films, Cameron infuses the action-driven story with strong female characters who are important to the plot, and crafts a morality tale about treating others with respect centered in a romantic relationship. \u200b\u200bMain character Jake uses a wheelchair in his daily life and a Na'vi  \"avatar\" body to interact with local populations, and the human-Na'vi relationship in question gets a bit complicated because the human is actually using his Na'vi avatar. Na'vi clothing makes parts of their bodies visible from time to time. The romantic leads have chemistry that's sometimes sensual. (Note: Fans of the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender should know that this movie is in no way connected to that show or the movie based on it.)\n|Positive Messages|: Overall, movie's message is that we could all stand to learn something from a population that's different from our own. Strong environmental and pro-peace themes. Some viewers may see the message of occupying a foreign land to usurp their cultural riches as a commentary on Western imperialism or United States' involvement in global politics.\n|Positive Role Models|: Several characters make difficult but moral choices. Jake chooses to support the Na'vi even though it's against orders to do so and means he must fight (and kill) fellow human soldiers. Neytiri, Grace, and Trudy all make personal sacrifices to help the clan; they're strong, courageous, assertive characters. (In both human and Na'vi populations, female characters are brave and important -- even the Na'vi mating ritual requires that both partners equally accept/choose each other.) On the flip side, the Colonel and corporate boss Parker are portrayed as bloodthirsty and greedy.\n|Diverse Representations|: Although humans on the base are racially diverse, majority of main characters are White. They use offensive terms and stereotypes when talking about the Indigenous population of Pandora, and the military engages in imperialist violence. These scenes, intended to encourage racial/ethnic equality and show value of treating other groups with respect, only partially succeed because, while the Na'vi ultimately triumph, they do so only by following the guidance of outsiders. Violent human colonizers are ultimately ejected from Pandora, but film glosses over how the Na'vi environment and population have been permanently damaged by even well-meaning human scientists and allies. Main character Jake has a visible disability: He uses a wheelchair and is initially teased and treated as an inconvenience. But he easily moves around the base in his wheelchair and asserts control over himself when others try to touch or move him without his consent. Women and female Na'vi characters are important in the story, hold prominent social roles such as scientists and spiritual leaders. No body size diversity. All romantic relationships are between male and female Na'vi.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters (supporting and extras) die due to explosions, bullet wounds, arrows (some treated with toxins), precipitous falls, asphyxiation. Several intense scenes involving frightening Pandoran animals and plants, as well as tension between Jake's rogue group of pro-Na'vi humans and the rest of the humans sent to Pandora.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many longing looks between Jake's avatar and Neytiri, which eventually leads to kissing and a marital \"mating\" ritual (kissing and touching are seen on screen). Na'vi clothing makes parts of their humanoid bodies visible. \u200b\u200bJake and Neytir's relationship is briefly referred to as \"getting tail.\"\n|Language|: The word \"s--t\" is used several times. Language also includes \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"piss,\" limp-d--ked,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God,\" \"ass,\" and insults like \"stupid,\" \"ignorant,\" etc. Degrading language is used to describe disabled people, such as \"cripple.\" Slurs such as \"savages,\" \"roaches,\" and \"blue monkeys\" are used to describe the Na'vi.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement in the movie, but dozens of tie-in merchandising deals tied to the title -- including toys and books aimed at young kids.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Sigourney Weaver's character, Grace, smokes cigarettes and somewhat glamorizes the activity.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684d61141d001fb181b9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-avengers", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Avengers is a superhero adventure in which many of Marvel's major characters -- including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) -- come together to battle an otherworldly enemy in a war to the end. From the first scene on, there's virtually nonstop comic book mayhem, including advanced weapons, epic-scale battle scenes, and thousands of casualties. Some of the fights are deeply personal as relatives face off, and some people do die, including characters the audience will care about. The heroes sometimes discuss their motivations for fighting crime, and the discussions can be intense, though it also leads to a good deal of camaraderie and cooperation. Expect some swearing (\"ass,\" \"son of a bitch,\" etc.), plenty of snarky quips from Iron Man, an off-hand joke about adoption that could upset some families, and intense 3-D action.\n|Positive Messages|: It's clear: Teamwork matters. The Avengers are best when they're working toward the same goal instead of letting others tear them apart. And the movie makes it very clear that you can step up and be a hero no matter what mistakes you might have made in the past. That said, not everyone in the \"good guys\" camp is always entirely on the up and up, and the heroes do have their share of conflicts before they come together. And violence is the primary means of conflict resolution (with tons of collateral damage).\n|Positive Role Models|: Though they have their quirks and frailties, ultimately the Avengers all show courage and work to overcome their individual challenges so they can accomplish their greater mission. They're not always successful, but when it counts, they come through. Within the group, there are many brands of heroism -- Steve Rogers (Captain America) is always upstanding and squeaky clean; Tony Stark (Iron Man) is snarky and selfish until matters come to a head; Bruce Banner (Hulk) fights his inner demons by trying to help others and avoiding conflict; Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) and Clint Barton (Hawkeye) have very checkered pasts but do the right thing when it matters; and Thor tends to act first and ask questions later but has a strong sense of honor and duty. Although Loki is Thor's brother, he shows no loyalty to him; Thor doesn't feel the same way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hugely explosive, destructive mayhem throughout most of the movie. There's not much in the way of gore/blood, but cars are flung from overpasses, a giant monster tosses people around like rag dolls, entire armies are decimated by lasers, massive explosions and mega aliens destroy buildings, etc. Casualties aren't lingered on, but they're presumably in the thousands; use of nuclear weapons is discussed. In one startling scene, an important supporting character is killed; other characters are injured. Lots of weapons (guns, hammers, shields, arrows, hands, bombs, and more) and fighting. The bad-guy aliens are pretty creepy looking.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirty banter and form-fitting outfits. Bruce Banner is briefly shown naked, but no sensitive body parts are shown, and it's not sexual in any way.\n|Language|: A few uses of words including \"ass,\" \"hell, \"damn,\" \"bastard,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"son of a bitch.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.

The biggest issue, of course, is the explosive, comic book-style violence, which includes nonstop destruction, fighting, weapons, flipping cars, imploding buildings, citywide devastation, and massive civilian casualties implied. There's also one sad death, as well as some kissing/flirting/innuendo/cleavage, swearing (\"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" etc.), and celebratory drinking. But as always with the Avengers, the ultimate message is that teamwork and loyalty will always save the day.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork and loyalty matter: United you stand, divided you fall. Don't let your fears get the better of you.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Avengers are all fighting for justice and to overthrow evil. Each has quirks and frailties, but ultimately they overcome their individual challenges to accomplish their greater mission.

Characters get shot and die (one very sad death), cars go flying with people in them, skyscrapers are reduced to rubble, and more. Children are sometimes right in the line of fire, buildings implode, missiles fly, and innocent casualties are countless (though they're not lingered on).

Families with younger kids should know that there's definitely as much intense violence (decapitation, explosions, stabbings, impalement, crushing, shooting, etc.), and even more pain, trauma, and grief here than there was in Avengers: Infinity War. Spoiler alert: A couple of beloved characters die, which will prove particularly upsetting. The language is similar to that in previous movies (mostly uses of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k\" -- even Captain America swears this time!), but there's no romance beyond a few brief embraces and kisses between established couples; a very minor male character talks about dating another man. Thor drinks a lot to numb his pain. Those who haven't seen any of the previous MCU installments should at least watch Infinity War and Captain America: Civil War to follow the plot, but those who are familiar with the movies and comics will be rewarded with plenty of inside jokes and references. With themes of courage, teamwork, and perseverance, this epic Avengers finale is the ultimate gift to Marvel fans -- they'll laugh, cry, and cheer as their favorite superheroes team up to save the universe one more time.\n|Positive Messages|: Violence is main means of conflict resolution, but story is primarily about courage, self-sacrifice, heroism, collective good. Themes include teamwork, perseverance, courage. Central characters are willing to die (and kill) to save universe and rescue Earth from grief/trauma they've experienced. Also shows how important family and friendship are, how concept of family is more than pure biology: People can have incredibly strong chosen families, with friends who love you unconditionally. Emphasizes idea of being who you are, not who you think you're \"supposed\" to be.\n|Positive Role Models|: Avengers and friends are flawed but unforgettably brave. They aren't individually as strong as Thanos, but together they can accomplish the impossible. They make sacrifices, protect one another, work together to save their loved ones and strangers alike. Women of Marvel once again have opportunity (albeit fairly brief one) to band together, and family men like Scott/Ant-Man and Clint/Hawkeye are particularly invested in doing what's necessary to save loved ones. Captain America and Thor prove themselves worthy of their special weapons/powers. Characters make difficult life-or-death decisions that put them in danger for the greater good. Thanos believes he's bringing salvation to universe, but his method -- genocide -- is untenable.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent and intense comic book-style action violence. Characters are killed, severely injured. Viewers will see dismemberment, decapitation, stabbing, crushing, shooting, impalement, choking, extremely destructive explosions, self-sacrifice, pursuit by scary monsters, etc. A character carries out ruthless vigilante justice, leaving lots of bodies in his wake. Weapons include guns, swords, axes, hammers, missiles. Violence isn't especially gory, but a couple of injuries/deaths are a bit bloody. Frequent peril and danger. Mourning/sadness. Arguments/yelling/shouting. Spoiler alert: A couple of beloved characters die in order to save the universe, and a couple of previously dead characters don't return to life, which could upset viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief kisses/embraces between a few romantic couples.

Also, it requires more knowledge of things that have happened in previous Marvel movies than other Avengers films have; it's the meeting point of several franchises and storylines. Violence is the biggest issue; it's stepped up even by MCU standards, with some torture and several impalings and crushings in addition to the usual smashed buildings, giant fights, and blasted spaceships. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is by far the most powerful nemesis the Avengers have faced, which the filmmakers establish right away with his brutal beatdown of one of the mightiest Avengers. The core plot element is mass murder on a universal scale, which might be a little much for younger viewers. Frankly, things get pretty grim: Key characters die, and the villains are much scarier than most comic book baddies. The gore level isn't higher; it's really the emotional impact that's different. There's also some strong language (including \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"dammit,\" and several colorful insults), but sex isn't a factor beyond a few loving kisses. As always, teamwork and courage are core messages as the Avengers (including Robert Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow), other MCU heroes (including Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange), and the Guardians of the Galaxy (including Chris Pratt's Star-Lord and Zoe Saldana's Gamora) come together to defend humanity -- and the universe.\n|Positive Messages|: Heroism, courage, self-sacrifice are front and center in most Marvel movies, but with stakes feeling even greater than usual here, they really stand out -- along with teamwork, of course. Several characters face ultimate test; most pass. Several make extremely difficult decisions while acting out of love. The crisis unifies the heroes instantly, reuniting factions. All that said, violence still the core problem-solving method, and Thanos' mission of \"mercy\" involves genocide.\n|Positive Role Models|: Motivations and actions are unusually believable for the genre. Characters can be selfish and sarcastic but also frequently make sacrifices and act to protect each other and in others' best interests. The Avengers are increasingly diverse (welcome back, Black Panther!); there are many strong female characters, including a powerful villain. Women make their own decisions and fight as hard and as bravely as the men. And Shuri may be the smartest. The youngest hero, teenage Spider-Man, is also brave and very clever. Thanos and his minions believe they're bringing salvation and mercy to the universe, but their method -- genocide -- is untenable.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent, intense, massively destructive comic book-style action violence, as well as brutal beatings, impalings, stabbings, and sudden smashings/crushings. Characters tortured. Violence is generally bloodless, but consequences feel real; the emotional impact is greater. Some deaths of well-known characters appear final, which will likely upset younger viewers. Also a scene of genocide, though actual murders aren't graphically or clearly shown. A flashback includes a scared child hiding with her mother from bad guys; the child is saved, but everyone she knows is killed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One scene is implied to be taking place after sex (one character gets out of bed, while the other remains there). Loving kisses between couples. Talk of love; flirting.\n|Language|: Not constant, but a couple uses of \"s--t,\" plus words including \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"douche bag,\" \"nut sack,\" \"dammit,\" \"d--khole,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"bastard,\" \"jerk,\" \"sucks,\" \"stupid,\" \"screwed,\" \"God\" (as an exclamation). Two suggested but incomplete uses of \"f--k\": One character says \"chill the F out,\" and there's a cut off use of \"motherf----r.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tony uses an ancient AT&amp;T flip phone. Verbal reference to Starbucks. Film is tied in to the vast merchandising/licensing efforts surrounding Marvel Comics.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e1632ff10faa500400d93f9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/awake-0", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Awake is a graphically violent and darkly suspenseful film with a strong but flawed Latina character as its lead. A global event wiping out electronics and making it so humans can't sleep means the characters are slowly going crazy from sleep deprivation. This affects different people differently, but most seem to get more violent. The film shows this graphically in shootings, drownings, car crashes, fights, electric shocks, and other gruesome deaths. A mob mentality seems to pervade, with a church group shouting to sacrifice a child, a bunch of people standing naked in the middle of the road (we see them from the back and from the waist up), and a group that tries to violently break into a car and drag a family out. The main character is trying to save her two kids, whom she's lost custody of due to a previous drug problem. She still sells pills to make extra money. A former soldier herself, she has survival skills that will help her, and her kids demonstrate bravery and quick thinking as well. There's quite a lot of swearing, including versions of \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"bitch,\" \"pr--k.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Families look out for each other. Some people maintain their hope and/or humanity in seemingly dire circumstances. Kids can demonstrate bravery and problem-solving skills. An apocalyptic event like the one in the film could theoretically shut society down and destroy a significant portion of humankind in a matter of days.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jill is a strong-willed survivor -- she has weathered rehab, the death of her soldier husband, and a court-ordered loss of custody of her two kids. She's also complicated: she still steals pills from her employer and sells them to a local drug dealer. And she's courageous: a former soldier herself, she's trained to keep her wits about her in a crisis, deal with death and injury, be skeptical, and know when to fight or run. Her kids are courageous and clever. Other people in the film are mostly untrustworthy or even violent due to the circumstances of the global event affecting them. The film's cast is diverse, and the lead character is a Latinx woman.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Pretty constant and graphic violence throughout the film. A car crashes and plunges into water, its occupants barely escaping. A woman glues her own open face wound back together. She demonstrates how to shoot a gun and almost shoots her son by accident. Two kids die -- from drowning and electric shock -- and are brought back to life. A man describes what happens to people when they lose sleep, from brain swelling to a malfunctioning of organs and more. A woman is drowned on purpose, a man is shot in the head at close range, two men are found dead of gunshot wounds, a man stomps on a dying man's head, escaped prisoners threaten a family, people are losing their minds, a church group wants to sacrifice a child, a man crashes a pole through a pharmacy window, a lab chimpanzee's head is cut open while it is still awake, a girl is given ether and a doctor proposes cutting into her as well, strange-looking men hang other people by their feet, zombie-like people attack a family in car -- grabbing at them, breaking windows, and splattering blood. A false alarm and lack of sleep leads dozens of heavily-armed military personnel to go on a shooting spree, killing each other and themselves and leaving almost no survivors. A woman imagines her son trying to stab her. An old lady dies.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A handful of naked adults stand in a road looking off in the distance. We see male and female nude bodies from the back and from the waist up. Matilda asks her brother whether he and his girlfriend ever \"do it,\" then she teases he's never had sex and he says \"I have!\"\n|Language|: Versions of \u201cf--k\u201d and \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"bitch,\" \"pr--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Some clothing and car brands can be made out or are named. The US military plays a major role in the plot.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Jill was in rehab and continues to steal and sell pills. The dealer she sells to tries to capitalize on people's need for sleep after the apocalyptic event by offering her more money to get \"zombie pills\" -- \"downers, benzos, phennies, tooies, red jackets.\" There's a party happening in a park and people are drinking. Jill's mother-in-law has to inject herself with medication. Members of the military inject each other in the neck with a concoction meant to help stimulate the brain despite a lack of sleep. A pastor shows a little girl the tattoo on his arm that covers up the evidence of his past drug addiction.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776835999c64001ec2f6fd": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/awakenings", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this is a moving story and may be tough on sensitive viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: Theme of respecting the humanity of those who are different.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Sad, but not scary.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: A few expletives.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d1951dd69001fe3fe86": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/babe", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Babe is a live-action farm tale that's widely considered one of the best family films ever made. The story of this spunky little big -- who seems to have no future but to eat and be eaten -- will inspire viewers of all ages. The harsh reality that farm animals are meant to feed humans may not sit well with some younger viewers (Christmas is equated to a bloodbath, because of all the animals slaughtered to end up on a dinner table), and some other parts of the movie could frighten kids. A scene in which wild dogs attack the sheep and kill one is particularly intense and disturbing. But at its core, this is a beautiful tale of perseverance, friendship, and making your dreams come true.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn how life on a farm works, and what usually happens to animals bred on a farm \u2013 they become our food. The way dogs herd sheep is also taught.\n|Positive Messages|: Many wonderful messages. One major theme is perseverance. Kids will learn that just because you don\u2019t look like you can do something doesn\u2019t mean you can't do it anyway. The idea that family is who raises you -- not just who gives birth to you -- is a powerful lesson for those who are or know adopted children.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both the farmer, who's a just and kind man, despite his stern exterior, and Babe, who works incredibly hard at becoming a diligent \"sheepdog,\" are positive role models for children. Babe is also never discriminatory against any animals, which is a valuable lesson in battling prejudice.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A pack of wild dogs attack sheep and kill one named Ma; she's shown with a bloody wound before she dies. Audiences know a duck is being slaughtered, but the actual killing isn't visible. Many references to slaughtering and how animals wind up as food on dinner tables. The farmer almost shoots Babe, mistakenly believing him to be responsible for the sheep's death. Some scenes may scare very young children, like when a piglet and puppies are taken away from their mothers or when Babe walks around in the dark slaughterhouse. Two dogs fight, and one bites a man's hand. A dog also tries to bite Babe.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Several insults are hurled, like \"butt-head,\" \"block-head,\" \"shut up,\" \"moron,\" and \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776ba0ad5437001f7a5376": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/baby-driver", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Baby Driver is an action-packed crime drama about a young getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) for a group of Atlanta bank robbers. Violence is constant and often glamorized. There are several mass shootings, with machine-gun deaths choreographed to music; you'll also see several car accidents with splintering glass and bloody dead bodies, sudden deaths, blood, and gore. Many of the characters eventually die sudden, terrible deaths. The main character is a reckless driver who performs over-the-top stunts; parents may want to remind teens not to try this at home. Characters kiss and make references to \"getting it on\" or \"role playing.\" Female characters are in short supply, and the ones who are in the movie are sidelined, portrayed in a stereotypical way, and ogled by both the characters and the camera. There's lots of swearing, including \"f--k,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" and more. One man calls another a \"retard\" and a \"freak\"; he also calls men things like \"ladies\" to imply they're weak. There's some smoking and social drinking; one character has a drug addiction he feeds by stealing.\n|Positive Messages|: There's a sympathetic, loving foster father and a tragic backstory, but these attempts at emotional/positive themes are secondary to the stronger negative takeaways regarding violence and crime.\n|Positive Role Models|: Perhaps the only notable role model is Baby's foster father, Joseph, who's loving and kind to Baby and tries to stop him from making mistakes. But he's treated shabbily by Baby (and the story). Female characters, all two of them, are sidelined and stereotypical; one's a manic pixie dream girl, the other a doomed femme fatale. Men are called \"p--sies\" and \"ladies\" to imply they're weak.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Constant, very unsettling action violence includes many mass shootings (generally of faceless \"henchmen\" types). Characters, including ones viewers are likely to sympathize with, are suddenly and brutally killed -- usually shot, but in one scene a character falls from a great height. Flying blood and gore, dead bodies, and use of big, flashy guns, including machine guns. Dead body stored in a trunk. A man's parents are killed in a car accident, which is replayed several times (viewers see a fast-approaching car and splintering glass); another car accident leaves the passengers covered in blood and one dead. Character run over by a car. Much of the action centers on getaway drives; these scenes are thrilling, but the violence is glamorized. (Remind teen viewers not to try this at home!)\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Characters kiss and talk graphically about sex they've had or are going to have, including jokes about role playing and \"getting it on.\" The camera ogles female bodies, lingering on legs and breasts; female characters are frequently shown in revealing clothing, and their looks are discussed and rated.\n|Language|: Frequent swearing includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"motherf--ker,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"p--sies,\" \"bitch.\" One man calls another a \"retard\" and a \"freak\" and asks if he has any \"balls.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: In an extended segment, Baby works as a Goodfella's pizza delivery guy; the company's logo and pizza box are shown several times.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink wine at dinner; one character smokes cigarettes.

Some kids may enjoy the diaper gags, but overall the humor is too crass and misguided to recommend to them.

Characters make fun of a woman's inability to get pregnant, and one treats pregnancy as a big pain. There's some \"white trash\" stereotyping involved with Poehler's character, but Angie ultimately proves to be a decent soul. Expect some drinking, references to drug use, and a fair amount of swearing (nothing stronger than \"s--t\") and product placement mixed in with the plentiful laughs.\n|Positive Messages|: All of the characters are flawed, though most of them have good intentions at heart. Kate frequently comes across as judgmental and a little bit snobby, while Angie's irresponsible \"white trash\" background is played up for laughs -- though, to the movie's credit, she has more depth than similar characters in other films. Characters deceive each other, attempt blackmail, and more. A subplot involves a big corporation coming into a small neighborhood and possibly hurting local business. New age philosophies are mocked (mostly gently). All but one of the central cast members are Caucasian.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two women hurl insults at each other during a massive screaming argument. A little bit of slapstick physical comedy.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No nudity, and not much beyond kissing is shown.

Also, the baby at the center of the tale ends up in all sorts of dangerous situations, including crawling through city traffic and cavorting through a construction zone, all without an accompanying adult and without injury. Kids will likely find the baby and the hijinks of the criminals funny, though the concept of kidnapping might make young kids uneasy. One bad guy is particularly rude to the other two.\n|Positive Messages|: The message -- however weakly delivered -- comes when the wealthy, superficial parents of Baby Bink learn to appreciate the people in their lives, instead of just their things and their reputation.\n|Positive Role Models|: The baby (though unwittingly) takes extremely dangerous chances, suggesting to young kids that they might be able to manage an adventure in the city without parents. Also, the bad guys are rude to each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The bad guys fall, get slapped and punched, hit their heads/groins, get into a tug-of-war with a gorilla.

Fox) and his friends are in physical jeopardy: A bully initiates a mostly off-camera assault on a high school girl, there's a violent attack in which a key character is thought to be killed, a van chases a teen on a skateboard, and more. There are also several episodes of bullying. While the violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show Marty's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to kiss and embrace him. Expect strong language, including a couple of memorable uses of \"s--t,\" as well as \"bastards,\" \"damn,\" \"a--hole,\" and a couple of racial slurs in the 1950s-set scenes. It's worth noting that this is the movie that alerted the public to the concept of product placement, with controversy arising from the near-constant visuals of Pepsi products and other brands.\n|Positive Messages|: Sends message that bullies must be stood up to and that intelligence, self-control, courage, and integrity ultimately win out over brute strength and intimidation. Also, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything, and creativity and imagination are qualities to be admired and nurtured.\n|Positive Role Models|: Marty is smart, charismatic, courageous, and a terrific problem solver (despite periodic self-confidence issues). Faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, he rises to every occasion. Doc Brown is shown to be ingenious as well as eccentric. Baddies are clearly in the wrong.\n|Diverse Representations|: Stereotypes Muslims and Arabs as terrorists when a group of men called \"the Libyans,\" dressed in skullcaps and keffiyeh, use assault rifles and a rocket launcher to attack White characters. A group of Black male musicians help Marty but are depicted as scary as they intimidate a White teen, who runs off and calls them \"reefer addicts.\" In a more positive but still token role, a Black man is the mayor of Hill Valley.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In an early scene, an attack by a squad of men includes automatic weapon fire and what appears to be a significant fatal shooting. Other sequences include suspenseful car and skateboard chases, a character threatened by a shotgun, some perilous scenes involving a tall clock tower, and punches thrown between high school kids. Bullying is a significant theme. A classmate initiates an off-camera assault on a high school girl; she struggles/expresses fear, and groping is implied. Someone intervenes before things go further. Perched in a tree, a boy spies through a girl's window as she undresses.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses and embraces; flirting. A teen girl is shown undressing down to her bra and underwear. Teen crushes are a key part of the story, with Marty becoming the object of affection of the girl who will grow up to become his mother.\n|Language|: Occasional swearing includes \"damn,\" \"butthead,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"bastards,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" (as an exclamation). In the 1950s-set scenes, a few racial epithets are used by the baddies, including \"Irish bug\" and \"spook,\" and a mayor is referred to as \"colored.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Many products prominently displayed and mentioned in dialogue.

But for mature older tweens -- or kids who've already enjoyed the original -- the visuals about the movie's \"future\" and the physical comedy will entertain, even if the time-travel twists can get confusing.\n|Positive Messages|: One of the movie's pervasive messages is that if you could change any one thing, it should obviously be to make yourself rich. That said, Marty's time travel demonstrates the importance of family (whereas Biff's desire for time travel is rooted solely in greed and materialism). The movie also has a strong theme about not letting what other people think of you bother you.\n|Positive Role Models|: Marty and Doc Brown are once again brave and selfless protagonists trying to undo the wrongs of time travel. Biff, on the other hand, only cares about making money and terrorizing and one-upping everyone he knows, especially the McFly family.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character is seen shot by terrorists but escapes injury. A bully makes several threats. Some dark/ominous imagery.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: More sexual innuendo than in the original. In addition to a couple of quick kisses between Marty and his girlfriend, there are references to breast implants and size, infidelity and unwanted advances. In one\n\tscene, a married male character is shown with his arms draped around two swimsuit-clad groupies in a hot tub.\n|Language|: Words not usually associated with PG movies are used a few times, including \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"a--hole.\" Other language includes \"hell,\" \"stupid,\" \"suckers,\" \"butthead,\" and \"loser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Product placements include Nike, Pepsi, Texaco, Black &amp; Decker, and AT&amp;T, all of which are sort of poked fun at, since the movie is set in the once-distant future.

But there's actually slightly less innuendo and a lot less bully-related violence in this one than in Part II. The coarsest language includes \"bitch,\" \"assh--e,\" and \"s--t,\" with several insults and synonyms for \"coward\" thrown in on a more regular basis. Although there's romance, it's very chaste except for two kisses and one off-color reference to what a woman could do that's worth $80 to settle a debt. All of the violence involves guns and fists, and in one brief scene it looks like Marty is going to be hanged, but no one dies, and it's all kept rather comical, even when a huge group of horse-mounted Indians are riding with guns and arrows. Unlike in the first two movies, in this one Doc Brown learns love is even more important than his rules for time travel.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: One of the most important messages in this movie is letting go of words that rile you up -- not taking the bait when bullies try to demean you. It's good for kids to learn that words, although they hurt, don't need to catalyze you to do self-destructive things. Marty finally learns this lesson at the very end of the film. Doc's decision also shows that in the end he values love over all else.\n|Positive Role Models|: In addition to Marty and Doc Brown, who always demonstrate the importance of loyalty, friendship, and trust, this trilogy installment benefits from the introduction to Clara, a sweet and kind teacher who falls in love with Doc Brown and stands up for herself against the town bullies.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence is all Wild West-style: there are barroom brawls, a shoot-out at dawn (well, 8 AM) and other old West violence, none of it particularly nasty. The Biff ancestor is aggressive and likes to push Marty and his ancestor around -- shooting at Marty's feet. When he first arrives in the Wild West, Marty encounters a group of horse-mounted Indians riding toward him with guns and arrows. In one brief scene, Marty is shown with a rope around his neck, as if he's about to be hanged -- until he's saved.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses but mostly there's a lot of longing looks between Doc and his love interest. In one scene a man makes a reference about what a woman \"could do worth $80,\" which a child may not understand but clearly alludes to sex. Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer also exchange a couple of heated kisses.\n|Language|: Some stronger words than usually heard in PG movies: \"bitch,\" \"assh--e,\" and \"s--t,\" as well as mild insults like \"damn you to hell,\" \"chicken,\" \"yellow,\" \"coward,\" \"lily livered,\" \"gutter trash,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Marty wears Nike sneakers, the discontinued sports car the DeLorean is of central importance.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: There's drinking in the town saloon that is shown a few times.

A man loses his pants and is seen in his underwear; at the last moment, viewers can see part of his butt through his chewed boxers. The word \"damn\" is used, and there's some potty humor. There are a couple of scenes involving alcohol. Several chase scenes include tranquilizer darts, knives, and threats of falling off of cliffs. On the bright side, it has strong messages about friendship, personality being more important than looks, not judging a book by its cover, and believing that you can be who you want to be.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Things aren't always as they seem. You are free to be whoever you want to be. Looks aren't everything. Don't judge a book by its cover.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pretty Boy is selfish and makes fun of other animals, calling them names like \"ugly.\" He experiences major character growth through the film and learns valuable lessons. Zookeeper Chaz deceives the animals he works with and lies to his son. He redeems himself and comes clean to his son and the characters he has betrayed.

There is one notable scene of a natural birth in which a naked, pregnant woman squats in an inflatable swimming pool; in one brief shot (played for comedy), her entire body is visible through the water. The movie also contains strong language, including one \"f--k\" and at least half-a-dozen uses of \"s--t.\" Ultimately, the gruesome details of childbirth and looming parenthood may be unappealing and perhaps even terrifying to teens, but some parents may find something to laugh about.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's ultimate point is that couples should learn to communicate and trust one another before jumping to conclusions and assuming anything. The lead characters must overcome many obstacles -- often related to the complexity of having children -- before they achieve this. Unfortunately, the movie can also be somewhat cynical and has the side effect of making childbirth and parenthood look unappealing.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters in the movie are fairly flimsy, with narrow behavior patterns. Stan is annoying, but once he decides to stay with the pregnant Zoe, he sticks to his guns throughout, no matter how tough it gets for him.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are some arguments and some shouting, and a few moments of slapstick, but nothing major.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There is very frank talk about sex and pregnancy, including the names of body parts and some unfortunate little details (such as uncontrollable bowel movements during a birth). The main character, Zoe, is artificially inseminated through a sperm donor, and we see and hear about this process. There's a scene of a natural birth (played for laughs) that includes a shot of a pregnant woman squatting naked in an inflatable pool; everything is visible through the water. Otherwise, the main couple (Zoe and Stan) flirts, kisses, and has sex, though nothing is shown. Zoe has a noisy orgasm, and Stan appears shirtless in one scene. In another scene, Zoe checks out her pregnant body in the mirror, but ducks out of sight a second later.\n|Language|: We hear strong, but not constant language, including one \"f---k\" and at least half-a-dozen uses of \"s--t.\" Also in earshot: \"Oh my God,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), \"vagina,\" \"pee,\" \"sperm,\" \"ass,\" \"stupid,\" \"penis,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"bitch,\" \"douchebag.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The couple likes to eat at Gray's Papaya, a real hot dog restaurant in New York.

Delivering a memorable message about the harmful impact of stereotypes, it follows a wolf (voiced by Sam Rockwell), shark (Craig Robinson), piranha (Anthony Ramos), snake (Marc Maron), and tarantula (Awkwafina) who've formed an infamous crime ring. There's cartoon violence -- characters being hit by a car, fighting in self-defense, explosions, etc. -- and momentary peril, but it's largely delivered with a light tone. Characters drink from glasses that look like they might have cocktails in them, and friends exchange insults and use potty words (\"butt,\" \"fart,\" etc.). Over the course of the story, the characters learn that being good means putting others' needs before your own and that positive recognition may follow good deeds; a subplot about sharing is as clear and shiny as a diamond.\n|Educational Value|: Learning to share is a subplot.\n|Positive Messages|: Doing good makes you feel good, and you may receive positive attention for positive actions. Also makes point that stereotypes are harmful, and that if someone is labeled \"bad,\" they may choose to lean into the label rather than fight it. Even those who have appearance of being \"good\" may need extra scrutiny before receiving our trust.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most of the primary characters are \"bad guys\" of some sort, but by the end they've made a conscious choice to change their ways. They work as a team.\n|Diverse Representations|: While main characters are all animals, they're voiced by a diverse cast, and viewers are intended to take away the idea that we need to be conscious of the impact of implicit bias and the way that attributes like race, religion, and more can be depicted as villainous by and in the media. Female characters are in traditionally male-dominated careers, such as a police chief, governor, and tech hacker.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon violence with no permanent outcome includes characters being hit by a car, eating other animals, tussling, performing martial arts in self-defense, explosions, and a car crash. Some peril is played with a comical tone; one moment of worry is quickly alleviated.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters seem to have a low-level attraction that involves dancing and the very lightest of flirting.\n|Language|: Vulgar language includes \"butt,\" \"fart,\" and \"what the hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Main characters are thieves who steal jewelry and gold objects, even though they appear to have plenty.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne and martini glasses are seen at parties; one character accepts what appears to be a martini.

There's plenty of swearing (including uses of words like \"s--t\" and \"f--k\" in front of tweens and teens), sexual references and innuendoes (including some simulated sex and lots of talk about breast implants), as well as dope smoking and drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: The positive messages aren't obvious, but if you dig, you can find a couple of take-aways: Love what you do or don't do that job at all. And be happy with yourself so you don't have to look elsewhere for validation.\n|Positive Role Models|: The least conscientious of teachers finds success and gets her way (though, in a small step toward enlightenment, she does learn a little about accepting her body and not doing anything just for personal gain). Characters who care are portrayed as overzealous and geeky, and only the \"bad\" teacher has enough edge to be cool.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman drugs/\"roofies\" a man so she can steal something and blackmail him later with compromising pictures. A teacher yells and berates her students, sometimes throwing a basketball straight at them (played for laughs). Characters yell at each other.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plenty of raunch. A man simulates sex while clothed with a woman who's not his girlfriend (later, he's shown with a wet spot on his groin). The same woman seduces another guy with frank talk about sex.

Although there's only one actual sex scene (no actual nudity, thought the couple strips down to their underwear and gets into bed), there are plenty of references to doing it (i.e. \"boning\") and getting it on. Some high-end labels and products are featured, and strong language, while infrequent, includes \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"s--t.\" The movie's messages about romance and relationships are very mixed, ranging from the positive adage that it's not \"getting married\" that's important but \"staying married\" to the iffier ideas that you have to be married and have kids to be a true woman and that a strong woman needs to let her husband \"lead.\"\n|Positive Messages|: On the one hand, there's a positive message about marriage being more than just a wedding day. William (whose parents were married for 40 years) tells Montana (whose mother has been married five times) that the \"magic isn't in getting married, it's in staying married\"). On the other hand, Montana seems desperate to be \"anybody's woman,\" and her entire 30-day plan seems selfish in order not to be one-upped by her engaged baby sister. Her desire to be married in order to be thought of as \"a lady\" -- and her mom's message that being a woman means being married with kids -- isn't exactly empowering for young women. But Montana does eventually learn that love and marriage should be based on friendship and trust, not an arbitrary timeline.\n|Positive Role Models|: William is an unconditional friend to Montana, even though she takes him for granted. Sam and Gail really want Montana to find love and are willing to put their jobs (and their spare time) on the line to help her find it (though, on the other hand, their characters are pretty stereotypical). Quinton, of all of Montana's suitors, is honest and kind about his intentions and hopes for their romantic future.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One woman threatens to kill her boyfriend when she believes he's in her apartment with another woman. She starts breaking things and screaming that she's going to beat him (and the other woman). Also some moments of physical comedy (like Mo falling out of a trash can or Sam and Gail play-slapping each other).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One sex scene (the woman strips down to her bra and panties as her lover takes off his shirt and pants on the bed), one scene in which a man is shirtless in a hot tub trying to coax a dressed woman to join him, and a few other kisses. Two people cheat on their partners. Gail refers to sex and her past experiences a lot (for example, she gives Montana a box of cranberry-flavored condoms), and Sam tells her that \"everyone knows you like to bone.\"\n|Language|: Infrequent strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" \"damn,\" \"idiot,\" and \"hoochie.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Jimmy Choo shoes, Samsung Galaxy phone, Renaissance Hotel, Tiffany ring, Cartier bracelet.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Montana and other adults drink on the plane and at various dinners and parties.

The violence portrayed, unlike in most contemporary animated movies, is realistic -- hunters fatally shooting Bambi's mother (off-screen, but still the first thing most viewers remember even decades later), a fire spreading throughout the animals' forest habitat, and Bambi and a fellow buck fighting over a potential mate -- and packs an emotional punch. With its mood-shifting color palette and intense sequences of thunderstorms, fires, and angry hunting dogs, this is a more intense movie than parents may remember. Very sensitive kids may not be able to handle the death of Bambi's mother, but otherwise, this is a Disney classic -- a direct precursor to The Lion King -- that families can watch together.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the importance of caring for the environment and being aware of the animals that live in the forest.\n|Positive Messages|: Early example of a environmentally friendly movie; humans are shown as a potential threat to the forest. Pro-hunting families may not appreciate how hunters are portrayed as the enemy, but in general, the message that we have a responsibility to take care of the forest and its inhabitants is a positive one. Friendship, community, and curiosity are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bambi's mother is selfless and always puts Bambi's safety above her own. All of the animals are kind and generous and brave. Man is portrayed negatively as an interloper that causes death and destruction.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are quite a few scenes that young children, especially, may find frightening. Bambi's mother is killed (off-screen) by hunters, and a young Bambi roams in the woods trying to find her, until his father says \"Your mother can't be with you anymore.\" A man-made fire spreads and consumes a lot of the forest. Every time man is involved, something frightening happens. A thunderstorm is loud and scary to the young animal characters. A quail is shot dead, and her lifeless body is shown before the rest of the animals flee. Bambi and another young buck fight. A fierce-looking pack of hunting dogs chase adult Bambi's mate Faline in a harrowing sequence.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In springtime, the adolescent animals all start pairing off, and Bambi and his various male friends (Thumper, Flower) flirt with females, snuggle and kiss, and in the following segment all of them have babies.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683af54112001f5be051": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/bambi-ii", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this movie picks up right where Bambi left off.

It might not be clear to the youngest viewers whether 7-year-old Chelsea's adventure -- leaving a cruise ship alone to seek a magic gem on a jungle island -- is meant to be real or imagined, considering all of the film and characters are imaginary. Chelsea makes some animal friends on her treasure hunt and learns valuable lessons about courage, strength, and quick thinking as she solves riddles and gets around sticky situations. She also encounters a giraffe held hostage in a giant spider's web, a roaring tiger, and snarling crocodiles. None of these stuffed animal-looking characters are drawn in a very menacing way except for a large Tiki statue, who has an angry face, a booming voice, and threatens Chelsea and her friends with hot lava spewing from a volcano. Tiki also shuts them into a dark cave. Barbie and her other two sisters go looking for Chelsea and encounter their own setbacks with poisonous flowers, hungry parrots, and quicksand. Parent viewers may wonder why Barbie's parents don't seem especially panicked when Chelsea goes missing on a large cruise ship, or why they don't seem to know where the girls are at most times. Barbie offers a specific representation of the female body, but here she and her sisters are teens, tweens, or kids, not women. The older two sisters seem to have their smart phones in their hands at all times. The film carries positive lessons about family, siblings, and giving little kids credit and some autonomy to demonstrate their own abilities. It adds another entry into the body of Barbie films and shows, thus serving as marketing for Barbie products: dolls and pets from this film are already on sale.\n|Educational Value|: Kisa may be inspired to try new things and face challenges with a brave face. They'll learn from Chelsea the importance of putting your friends first and valuing your family.\n|Positive Messages|: Even little kids should be listened to and allowed to attempt new challenges. They're often capable of more than they're given credit for. Sometimes letting someone do something on their own is the best way to help. Nothing's more important than family. Growing up is worth celebrating. Don't be afraid of sharing your talents with others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie's family is on an eco-friendly cruise ship thanks to her mother's job, which involves coding and the ship's computer systems. As the big sister, Barbie often repeats that her job is to help her three younger sisters, and her parents regularly leave her in charge, disappearing for most of the movie. Chelsea demonstrates courage and friendship in her island adventure. Chelsea's island companions say they wish to pursue their hobbies, get home, make friends, and be helpful. The activities director is mean, doesn't like kids, and is keeping a secret. The assistant activities director helps the girls find Chelsea. Chelsea learns to be brave, strong, and clever on her adventure. Barbie offers a specific representation of the female body, but here she and her sisters are teens, tweens, or kids, not women.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A 7-year-old girl appears to leave the cruise ship alone, take a zip line across the ocean, and embark on a treasure hunt on a jungle island with some animals she picks up as companions. A Tiki statue is angry and repeatedly threatens Chelsea and the gang, at one point closing them into a cave. The girls encounter giant spiders, quicksand, poisonous flowers, hungry parrots, a seemingly angry tiger, and snarling crocodiles on the island. A volcano spews lava.

The movie is fine for younger kids but does contain one potentially scary moment when wolves menacingly creep up on Barbie and her horse until another more powerful horse intervenes and scares the wolves away. The language includes some colorful insults exchanged by bitter rivals such as, \"You hair of a child's nostril\" and \"You pig of a dog of a mule.\" It's not a major plot point, but there is a little romance between Skipper and a Swiss equestrian. Kids might learn a thing or two about equestrian competitions.\n|Educational Value|: Barbie movies aim to entertain, not educate, but young viewers will learn about the discipline needed to be a competitive equestrian as well as the various events in which equestrians compete (dressage, jumping, cross country). They will also learn that the Alps are in Switzerland, the movie's location.\n|Positive Messages|: Barbie's relationship with her three sisters promotes healthy sibling relationships through kindness (as opposed to the rival brothers). Healthy competition also is highlighted but more as a way to find one's strength, not necessarily to win. Lastly, being gentle to animals is encouraged.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie is a kind, understanding big sister who encourages and supports her younger siblings.

Mild suspense accompanies the group during the climax when the crooks chase them through underground caverns with a rickety bridge, bats, and a rockslide. No one is hurt.

Some parents might question \"girl power\" being defined by using weapons. Barbie and her friends fight and go after bad guys with their self-made weapons.\n|Positive Messages|: Barbie goes to battle? Maybe not as egregious as this, but Barbie and her friends train to fight and do indeed drop a host of bad guys with their self-made weapons. The idea that girls can't be Musketeers motivates Barbie and her friends to try their hardest to fulfill their dreams to be swashbucklers with swords. Eh...\n|Positive Role Models|: Brandishing a weapon does not make Barbie a strong, empowered role model. And Musketeers do not necessarily screech, \"Musketeers rock!\" with a cheerleader bounce.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Considering that it's Barbie, there's a lot of sword play and macho language from the girls. \"Let's do this!\" Barbie shouts as they take on a group of ne'er-do-wells. As they prepare for a costume ball where there's danger, Barbie and her friends decide to make \"weapons that blend in with our costumes.\" Barbie runs with a sword to best the bad guy atop a Parisian church.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A good deal of accidental touching and special moments with the Prince, as Barbie attempts to save his life.

But within those confines, Barbie manages to foster good friendships, find solace in art, and still take the high road with those who've wronged her.  There's some very minor fighting with swords, magic power that knocks characters off their feet, and a brief scene where guards are tied up and their mouths duct-taped.\n|Educational Value|: The movie encourages a love of art, and it could inspire some kids to try their hand at painting or creating.\n|Positive Messages|: Barbie as Rapunzel promotes positive messages about loyalty, friendship, courage, being true to your dreams, and most significantly, believing in yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters in Barbie as Rapunzel are fairy-tale simplistic -- everyone is either good or bad, and there isn't much in between. However, the positive attributes found in Rapunzel, her friends, and the minor characters we encounter, some of whom admit they are wrong, offer forgiveness, and work to resolve conflict, offer admirable traits worth emulating.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There is some very minor fighting with swords, magic power that knocks characters off their feet, and a brief scene where guards are tied up and their mouths duct-taped.

The main character talks about missing the family from whom she was separated at a young age. A depiction of a near-drowning is harrowing, and younger kids may need some help understanding the villain's motivation, which is presented in song. The traits that define the heroine are bravery and compassion, not just beauty.\n|Positive Messages|: Two characters who might have been enemies in another studio's hands end up being kind to and supportive of each other -- good girl-power message.

It also takes the familiar fable and gives it a significantly more fairy tale-like ending with this romance-driven plot, though it does throw in a few modern updates.\n|Educational Value|: The movie features singing and an interest in science, which could inspire those interests in young viewers, and draws attention to class inequality.\n|Positive Messages|: Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper offers positive messages about loving people just as they are, the insignificance of material things or wealth, the power of friendship, and the importance of following one's dreams.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters in Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper are largely positive, but fairly one-dimensional: the kind princess, the dreamer, the concerned mother, the evil henchman. Most of the characters in Barbie's world strive to be good people who do the right thing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There is very mild violence and some suspenseful stretches. In one scene, Princess Anneliese is kidnapped and locked up. In a later scene, she and friend Julian are trapped in a mine shaft with rising water that threatens to drown them.

Barbie and her high school friends work at modeling such virtues as friendship, loyalty, decency, and academic effort. When they make mistakes, they do their best to correct them. Mean girls and popular kids pose challenges, sometimes exhibiting exclusionary behavior. Barbie has a crush on a popular jock but realizes she really likes a less popular guy better.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Be yourself. Writing your goals down can help you reach them and understand yourself. Loyalty is a valuable quality. It doesn't matter how many people at school know who you are. It only matters that you know who you are.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie is a good student. She plays in a band and wants to anchor a school newscast. She is considered a nerd and isn't one of the school's popular girls. Barbie invents a lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, making it possible for girls to apply makeup in class without teachers noticing. The popular girls want others to be jealous of them.

There's never any doubt that everything will end up \"happily ever after,\" but there are a few scenes of mild peril and a villainess with creepy henchmen made of fungus. Nothing offensive to note, except that as with most movies aimed at young girls, there is blossoming romance -- including a character who acts jealously toward a fairy who might be her rival for a mermaid prince's affection. Families concerned with consumerism should note that the movie acts as an 85-minute commercial of sorts for the merchandise of Barbie's Fairytopia collection.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn about teamwork and selflessness in the face of danger. They may also understand how important it is to keep the sea clean.\n|Positive Messages|: \"Trust your true self\" is Barbie's motto. If you put your personal differences aside, you can work together with someone toward a shared goal. Elina and Nori don't start out as friends, but they agree to try and save Nalu together, and only together do they succeed. Impetuous Nori learns that patience is an important virtue.\n|Positive Role Models|: Elina is a courageous, generous, heroic fairy who will go to great lengths to help her friends in need. She is willing to forgo her wings and even turn into a mermaid to save Nalu from Laverna's grasp.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An evil Fairy, Laverna, is threatening and power-hungry.

Exactly like most Barbie movies, that character learns predictable lessons about selfishness and caring. Though not period-appropriate for Victorian England, a close biracial friendship is depicted. Ghosts play a part in the story, but not in a way that would scare even young children (one looks like a Valley girl, another Ethel Merman, and the third looks like a queen). There is virtually no discussion of the religious aspect of the holiday.\n|Positive Messages|: As in the original Charles Dickens story, a miserly, selfish main character is changed and learns to value the true meaning of the Christmas holiday.

The sequel to Barbie in a Mermaid Tale features a little violence, but nothing scarier than an evil mermaid who can make others' worst \"nightmares\" a reality (usually a mental or emotional fear). One of Merliah's friends is a bit ditzy, but overall the characters work together to defeat the nefarious, self-obsessed villain.\n|Educational Value|: Barbie movies are for entertainment purposes, but kids may learn a few incidental things like that the national dishes of Australia and Hawaii are pickled beetroot and poi.\n|Positive Messages|: Like most Barbie movies, this tale focuses on teamwork -- here, between Merliah and her surfing rival Kylie. The various mermaid ambassadors also work together against Eris' villainous pursuit to control the ocean. Merliah's friends aren't bothered by the fact she's a mermaid. Merliah is willing to help Kylie, even though she stole Merliah's magical necklace.\n|Positive Role Models|: Merliah and her mother, Calissa, are visions of elegance, intelligence, and grace. They're intelligent and kind and only use their physical strength when defending themselves or others. Merliah, like all typical teenagers, is competitive and would like to prove she's better at surfing than Kylie, but in the end she does what's right for the merfolk even though it means she won't surf again.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's mild violence when Eris lures Kylie to the whirlpool and traps her.

Kara and Corinne, a rival cousin who becomes Dark Sparkle, become invincible heroines capable of rescuing innocents, rounding up criminals, and defeating powerful villains. Along with Kara's best friends, who are scientific masterminds, technological advances are made and weaponry is created, all to combat evil. Still, Kara's interest in fashion and friendship is retained; after all, she is played by Barbie.

No ethnic diversity; however, skin tones are darker on one female teen.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent cartoon action sequences: Characters fly through the air in out-of-control vehicles, crash-land, and destroy property.

Despite the usual idealized faces and bodies of the Barbie characters, this franchise entry aims for individuality and to show what a treat it can be to meet people from different backgrounds. Music plays an important part of the story and is the uniting factor between the two camps. A comic, cheating villain and time constraints provide the mild suspense. This contemporary princess story should appeal to a wide range of Barbie fans, from the youngest through tweens.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Clear messages about acceptance of differences and change; friendship, helping others, and the value of working together; the importance of creativity (\"everyone has a talent; you just need to let it out\").

Though it does not hold completely true to Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, the music in the movie is the real thing, as performed by the London Symphony.\n|Positive Messages|: Clara and the Nutcracker journey together to save the people of Parthenia, who have suffered under the violent rule of the Mouse King. There is more emphasis, however, on Clara's pretty presence than her abilities, which makes it anyone's guess as to why the Nutcracker wants to share his leadership role with her.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie plays a role model to a little girl named Kelly, who is trying to learn ballet steps for the Nutcracker ballet.

There is a bigger educational component to the movie than previous movies, because this one focuses on a teenage ballerina who gets transported into the premises of famous ballets, like Giselle, Swan Lake, and The Snow Queen. Young viewers will learn about the various characters and plot lines of the ballets. Two villains are slightly menacing, particularly the Snow Queen who can freeze people, but never fear, there's still a happy ending.\n|Educational Value|: Unlike other Barbie movies, which don't have an educational component, this one focuses on a ballerina who explores the story lines (albeit oversimplified to skim over the sadder parts) of a few famous ballets, like Giselle, Swan Lake, and The Snow Queen.\n|Positive Messages|: The overriding message of the movie is to dance from your heart, which is undeniably a sweet lesson. But what's odd is that Kristyn is applauded for dancing her own steps, getting lost in the music, when ballet is an art form that does not encourage changing choreography and doing her own thing. Overall, however, there is a positive message about sharing your talents, believing in yourself, etc.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kristyn refuses to leave the ballet \"otherworld\" until she has helped the villagers and then her friend Hailey defeat the evil Snow Queen. Hailey is a supportive best friend who encourages Kristyn to stay true to her artistry, even if the ballet director isn't a fan of Kristyn's style.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As is common in Barbie movies, there is mild violence as the villain -- in this case the Snow Queen -- \"freezes\" people into ice statues and forces characters to dance until they're exhausted. She's generally a menacing, cruel presence. Rothbart, the villain from Swan Lake, turns Kristyn and Hailey into swans, but he's less frightening than the Snow Queen.

This story about inter-fairy relations is a kid-friendly study in cultural acceptance, friendship, and teamwork.\n|Educational Value|: Barbie titles aren't intended as educational, but kids do learn lessons in friendship and cooperation.\n|Positive Messages|: There are some positive messages about not making assumptions about people or believing stereotypes about them based on their heritage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mariposa is smart, kind, and thoughtful. She reads about crystal fairy culture and traditions before heading there and tries her hardest to adhere to all of their customs when she's visiting. She is more interested in books than in fashion. Catania is her kindred spirit, and she wants to help the butterfly fairies rather than fear them like her father the king.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Gwyllion seeks revenge against the crystal fairies by turning all their crystal lights to stone. She freezes most of the inhabitants of Shimmervale, but they are eventually restored. Catania forgives Gwyllion, who in turn is remorseful for her actions.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Prince Carlos is obviously smitten on Mariposa, so he asks her to dance at a fairy ball.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: The Barbie movies have distinct storylines, but they're all created to further the marketing of their newest line of tie-in Barbies.

In this story, Barbie trades places with a princess who looks a lot like her. It's not the first Barbie movie with this storyline, but this film's main messages are about teenage girls finding their own identity and voice, and figuring out how best to share that online. Musical numbers are concerned with learning to be yourself, figuring out who and what you want to be, making memories and not just shareable photos, and taking responsibility for your own decisions and mistakes. There's a message about not having to be picture-perfect, although most of the characters have thin figures. Some animated violence includes chase sequences on boats, mopeds, and horses; Barbie and Amelia both being kidnapped by (and then escaping from) royal guards and an ill-intentioned prince; exploding headphones; and airport mayhem when Barbie's puppies get loose. In this film, Ken is eager to tell Barbie something, maybe that he likes her. In a final scene, he asks her to dance. Barbie also shares a couple of dances with Prince Johan, and the high school principal seems attracted to the \"handsome\" royal adviser. Like the other movies in the Barbie universe, this film is appropriate for little kids, despite some gender stereotypes and lots of marketing tie-ins to dolls and related products.\n|Educational Value|: Lessons about self-confidence and finding one's identity and voice as well as appropriate uses of social media.\n|Positive Messages|: Discover and stay true to yourself. \"Don't let yourself get put inside a box.\" Inspire others. \"You can be whatever you want to be.\" Make memories, not just photos: \"Life doesn't happen on camera. Life is what happens when the cameras are off.\" Some gender stereotypes. Message about not having to be picture-perfect, although most characters have thin figures.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie is finding her own voice, wants to inspire others through her vlog, but she lacks much of an audience. When she's offered a major platform by an unscrupulous content aggregator, she has to decide what changes she's willing to live with. Amelia has a mass audience but hasn't been allowed to find her own identity and voice, as well as her own image beyond the \"picture-perfect\" princess she's been packaged as. Both girls are searching for their true identity, how best to share that with the world. Alfonso has to learn to trust Amelia to make her own decisions (and mistakes). Prince Johan uses unethical means to try to gain power; his plans are ultimately thwarted. Barbie's friends support her, keep her secrets, help her escape when she and Amelia are kidnapped. Cast is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Animated violent sequences (nobody is injured or seriously hurt) include chase scenes on mopeds, boats, horses; Barbie and Amelia being kidnapped by (then escaping from) royal guards; exploding headphones; and airport mayhem when Barbie's puppies get loose.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: High school principal is attracted to \"handsome\" royal adviser.

Once the sisters work together and discover the joys of staying at the Tannenbaum Inn, they're able to have the \"perfect Christmas.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Barbie tries very hard to be a good big sister, and she's devastated when she can't get her sisters to New York City.

In this story, Barbie Roberts from Malibu (voiced by America Young) travels to New York City for a summer performing arts program. There she meets Barbie Roberts from Brooklyn (Amber May), and the two become fast friends. The movie has clear, strong themes about working hard to achieve your goals and keeping a positive attitude, even when things get tough. Both Barbies learn that competition isn't about winning at all costs, but rather about trying your best. The cast is racially diverse, with strong female leads. But there's not much diversity in size and body type. Potentially upsetting moments include a father speaking unkindly to his daughter. He also lies to try to give his daughter an edge in the competition.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Songs and conversations about working hard to achieve your goals and keeping a positive attitude.

They also help a side character who feels discouraged in his work and encourage him to keep trying.\n|Diverse Representations|: Heavily female cast.

While there's little objectionable content in the story (besides the inclusion of a perpetually ignorant \"air head\" character), the entire movie is made to boost advertising and generate even more interest in the dolls and their accessories -- in this case about a princess academy where one spot is reserved for a lottery winner who will learn how to be a lady-in-waiting to royalty. Despite the emphasis on makeovers and fashion, there's a stronger than usual focus on practicing skills (even if they're of the \"finishing school\" variety), telling the truth, and being kind to those less fortunate.\n|Educational Value|: Through the story, kids may learn the importance of honesty, loyalty, and friendship, as well as the value of practicing to perfect for your skills.\n|Positive Messages|: Good messages include teamwork, practicing your skills until you perfect them, and telling the truth even when you may not benefit from it. Unfortunately, the movie also has the side effect of making young girls want to buy Barbie dolls and all of the accessories shown in the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Blair is a good role model; she's kind to her mother and sister, hardworking in order to earn money for her family, and persistent in her studies at the princess charm school.

In fact, all female characters in this tale are strong and intelligent. The filmmakers have conscientiously left the shopping and dress-up behind, except for one short sequence as they prepare to disguise themselves. Among other positive messages (teamwork, loyalty, courage), the concept of visualization -- \"See it, then be it!\" -- is introduced as a method of prepping for challenging tasks.

She's come a long way from her origins as a curvy beauty who primarily focused on appearance, clothes, and social activities. This Barbie has a can-do attitude, participates in her community (in this case, a distant galaxy), and is a solid role model for her fans. In fact, other than one ball gown, Barbie's attire is all practical, appropriate for her character's active lifestyle. Some mild cartoon action, including a challenging journey through an electrical field, falls, and a sparring match with a teammate, is delivered with a light hand, only a bit of suspense, and no serious consequences. The story and accompanying original songs are chock-full of clearly-stated (and repeated) messages about believing in yourself, taking a risk when it's the right thing to do, and always listening to your heart (i.e., your better instincts). It's important to note that setting Barbie on an adventure in a high-tech, far-off universe is a boon for Mattel and its licensees, providing them with a wide variety of new marketable characters, products, and media entries.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Clearly stated messages throughout about following one's heart.

Some families may not appreciate how much this story focuses on appearance, makeovers, and fashion (the main character is a gifted hair and wardrobe stylist).

Like all of the Barbie movies, the storyline is a means to appeal to interested girls who will go on to ask their parents for the specific Barbie dolls (in this case Tori or Keira). Marketing reasons aside, this is a harmless movie about getting the chance to be \"who you want,\" venture outside your comfort zone, and learn what it's like to be different, even if it's just for a couple of days.\n|Educational Value|: This is strictly for entertainment purposes, though some positive social messages are included.\n|Positive Messages|: By switching places, Tori and Keira realize that the grass is always greener no matter who you are -- the pop star wants to be more like the princess, and vice versa.

Language isn't constant but includes several uses of \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" and more. Characters kiss, there's sex-related dialogue, and a woman is seen in her underwear as she dresses. Part of the plot revolves around a fictitious drug business; the drug consists of drops placed in the eyes (addicts are called \"dropheads\"). The movie is more diverse than previous takes on the Dark Knight, deals thoughtfully with the nature and cost of vengeance, touches on how social media can spread misinformation, and, even with a 175-minute runtime, is one of the best Batman movies to date.\n|Positive Messages|: Ponders the nature and cost of vengeance and what it means to genuinely help people (i.e., \"Am I doing this for myself, or for others?\"). Also touches on how social media can spread misinformation (and, subsequently, violence), the idea that power corrupts, and what it takes to remain a good person.\n|Positive Role Models|: Batman is a troubling character, as he uses violence to solve problems, but he also uses his head, and he learns the difference between vengeance and trying to do good in the world.

Less cartoonish than the Spider-Man and X-Men movies, these scenes are loud and rough. The caped crusader's origin story includes the murders of his parents, his ensuing depression and attempt to shoot the shooter, martial arts training and fighting, frightening subjective images brought on by hallucinogenic drugs, brief debauchery (drinking, smoking, and swimming-in-a-hotel-fountain with vacuous starlet-types), an even briefer kiss with his romantic interest, a faux drunken speech, and some raucous driving in a seriously armored Batmobile.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overall dark tone gives a sense that the world is a dangerous place, filled with people with bad intentions. There is an attempt to wrestle with the ideas of good and evil and whether the end justifies the means. But overall there is a sense that there are some heroes in the world who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.\n|Positive Role Models|: Batman is obviously a hero. He fights for justice and fairness, though his tactics are sometimes just as violent or sneaky as the bad guys'. He is a flawed character, but that's what makes him so compelling. One character seems like a good guy at first, but ends up being a scary villain.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some violence is harshly rendered, with sharp, fast editing. Martial arts, gunplay, references to the murder of the hero's parents which he witnessed as a child.

Superman: Dawn of Justice is a dark, serious superhero drama that pits the titular DC comics characters -- Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) -- against each other, though ultimately the message is one of teamwork. As the two grow distrustful of each other, supervillain Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) sets the stage for an even deadlier battle between the forces of good and a nearly unstoppable evil. The violence can be up close and personal: Characters' loved ones are captured at gun point, an entire room explodes, and people are shot execution style. There's some romance and passionate kisses between Clark and Lois (who live together) -- one that takes place in a tub while she's taking a bath (her bare shoulders/legs are seen, as is a woman's bare back in another scene, as well as men's bare chests). Language is limited to a couple of uses of \"s--t\" and \"damn,\" and adults drink wine and cocktails. Note: This review is of the PG-13 theatrical release; the R-rated extended cut may contain additional content.\n|Positive Messages|: As in most movies about more than one superhero, the film has messages about the importance of using teamwork to defeat a common threat -- and of knowing there are those who love and depend on you to make wise choices.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite their flaws, doubts, and animosity toward each other, Bruce/Batman and Clark/Superman both ultimately act courageously to help save their cities from more destruction. They're different kinds of heroes, but both must deal with the burden of their abilities/powers and their responsibility to those around them. Diana Prince must decide whether to become Wonder Woman again or let the men fight without her help.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A high body count, both from explosions and collateral damage from the superheroes' fights. Assassins shoot and kill many people. An intense car chase leads to lots of deaths. Buildings collapse, an entire room full of people is blown up, and characters/crowds are injured or die. Characters are abducted at gunpoint. Batman and Superman fight and hurt each other.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Clark and Lois, who live together, kiss several times. In one scene, she's taking a bath (her bare shoulders and legs are visible), and then he gets in the bath (dressed), and they start kissing passionately. Bruce is a player, as always; he wakes up next to a half-naked woman who's sleeping in his bed; her back is visible. He also flirts with Diana Prince. Both Bruce and Clark are shown shirtless.\n|Language|: A couple of uses of \"s--t,\" \"damn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Jeep, Rolls Royce, Aston Martin.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Bruce drinks a lot of wine, and adults drink cocktails at parties.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f356bca3253001ef28c35": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/be-my-valentine-charlie-brown", "cs_age": 3, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 3+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown focuses on the disappointments and frustrations of Valentine's Day with sophistication and humor.

But those drawn to the movie by its stars (High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens and \"it\" boy Alex Pettyfer) and basic romantic supernatural storyline might be disappointed by what ends up feeling more like a toothless high school popularity contest movie. Plus, unlike Twilight, this film has some strong language (including \"s--t\") and underage drinking, as well as kissing, sexual innuendo, and plenty of label-dropping. Witchcraft plays a role in the plot.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie is ultimately saying that beauty isn't skin deep, and valuing the outside above all else can make your insides ugly.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lindy is earnest and caring, but she seems to be the only character who's genuinely kind and gentle -- though Kyle does undergo an emotional and physical transformation that teaches him about what's most important.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man shoots another man off screen and kills him; the body is later seen.

Scenes show him preparing drugs with a spoon and lighter, injecting drugs, stealing pills and popping them, driving under the influence, attending meetings, etc. He smokes pot with his father (Steve Carell); in one scene, the dad also snorts cocaine. Language is very strong, with multiple uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. Teens have sex in a shower, with kissing, thrusting, and moaning, but no explicit nudity. Characters shout and argue, and a teen girl nearly dies of an overdose but is saved through CPR. While the performances are fine and the film certainly gets its anti-drug message across, it's grueling and heavy-handed, as well as very mature.\n|Positive Messages|: Clearly message is: \"Don't do drugs.\" Characters suffer acutely; doctors explain ways in which crystal meth systematically attacks brain and feeds on itself. Family members try to stick by one another, but a father also learns hardest lesson of all: Sometimes there's nothing he can do to help.\n|Positive Role Models|: Nic does have good moments when he's sober and spending time with family, but his struggle is harrowing, his behavior often abominable.

The main character's mission to date as many guys as possible has iffy messages for teens about responsible relationships. Sporadic language (\"hell\" and \"ass,\" mostly) is another concern, but none of this is probably new to the teen viewers the movie is geared toward. The main character lies and deceives her coworkers for the sake of her article, but the eventual exposure of her actions forces her to take responsibility for what she's done.\n|Positive Messages|: While Lane nearly loses everything she's worked for -- both personally and professionally -- when her many lies catch up with her, she learns her lesson about toying with others' trust and emotions and finds that it's impossible to go wrong when you follow your heart. Some iffy messages about a woman's need for a man are part of the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lane is smart, professional, and driven to succeed, often at the expense of those around her. She sets aside others' feelings in her efforts to date as many guys as possible in a short time.

Beast's initial ferocity might scare younger viewers, though once they've seen his gentle side, scenes of him being hunted and stabbed by Gaston are likely to be emotionally upsetting. The sequence in which a mob comes after Beast is also quite intense, and there's a fair bit of cleavage on display during the bar-set \"Gaston\" number. But kids mature enough for feature-length stories will find this one of the best Disney movies they could spend time with in terms of intelligence, quality, and originality -- not to mention having one of Disney's smartest, most independent heroines. Note: The movie's 2012 3D theatrical rerelease intensified the musical numbers like \"Be Our Guest\" and the waltz scene in \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but it didn't make Beast's roars or the mob scenes too much scarier than they are in 2D.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, not educate, but kids will take in some important lessons about appreciating others for who they are, not what they look like.\n|Positive Messages|: This timeless story has always revolved around the idea that it's important to see someone for who they are, not for what they look like. Also, brain wins out over brawn. Themes include compassion, curiosity, empathy, and self-control.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters change for the better -- Belle sees the beautiful person inside Beast, and he sheds his anger and sacrifices his own happiness for hers. Belle values intelligence, books, and individuality.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Beast has angry outbursts. Fierce wolves attack the main characters. Townspeople decide to kill Beast and storm the castle in a scary, intense mob sequence. In the climactic fight, a knife-wielding character falls to his death. Spooky woods, scary scenes when Belle and her father encounter the Beast. Belle and the Beast yell at each other.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lumiere comically flirts with a maid, with fooling around implied. Budding romance between Beast and Belle, with some mild flirting and kissing. Bosomy barmaids swoon for Gaston during the song about him -- which also includes some innuendo and references to his physical appeal.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Belle is a Disney Princess whose brand reaches far and wide.

Although the movie will appeal to even very young viewers, especially those familiar with the original, the remake's violent sequences can be very intense, with a few jump-worthy and upsetting moments (several involving snarling wolves, others guns) that leave characters bloodied, injured, and, in one case, dead. As always, the story encourages viewers to look beyond the superficial and to be compassionate, curious, humble, and generous. Director Bill Condon took care to make sure that this version had diverse supporting characters, including a gay LeFou (Josh Gad) -- Gaston's sidekick, who briefly dances with a man -- and people of color not represented in the animated version.\n|Educational Value|: Kids familiar with the animated version will learn about adaptations and the impact of live-action stories vs. animated ones. They'll also become familiar with one of the most universal fairy tales in Western literature and learn lessons about compassion and humility.\n|Positive Messages|: It's important to see beneath the surface (looks, social class, etc.) to really know who people are. The Beast's curse illustrates the importance of generosity of spirit rather than greed and shows the value of humility. Belle's love of books demonstrates the transformative power of reading/education, and her interest in teaching a girl to read shows that girls should be every bit as educated as boys. Also, you can't just stand by when someone treats someone else poorly; you should act. Freedom is essential to true happiness. Themes also include compassion, empathy, and curiosity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Belle is intelligent, strong-willed, curious, and kind. She's a loving daughter who gives up her freedom in exchange for her father's. Maurice is doting and sweet. The Beast learns to love because of his relationship with Belle, and Belle sees beyond his rough exterior to his gentler soul, buried beneath his demanding, beastly exterior. The castle servants work together to help Belle see beyond the Beast's scarier aspects. Several characters redeem themselves. Gaston is selfish, shallow, and cruel, but he's clearly intended to be a villain/poor example. The supporting cast is very diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scary, intense scenes involving snarling, hungry wolves. They attack Maurice after a tree suddenly falls in front of his wagon in a dark, spooky forest, and they go after Belle when she leaves the castle (the Beast fights them and is left wounded and bleeding). The Beast growls/roars several times. Belle takes a snowball to the face. (Spoiler alert!) Flashbacks reveal that the prince's and Belle's mothers both died of sickness; their children are separated from them in both cases (sad/upsetting). Gaston yells at Maurice, threatens him, punches him, and ties him to a tree and leaves him there. Gaston has Maurice and Belle arrested and violently incites mob violence (pitchforks, torches, battering rams, etc.) and uses a gun to shoot the Beast. Villagers and castle servants fight. One character plummets to their death as the castle crumbles.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting, dancing (both opposite-sex and same-sex couples), and a couple of kisses. Some dresses show a little cleavage.\n|Language|: Insults include \"idiot,\" \"fool,\" \"crazy,\" \"delusional,\" \"peculiar,\" \"hag,\" etc. Also \"shut up\" and a reference to \"eternal damnation.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film itself, but Disney has plenty of merchandising tie-ins, from apparel and accessories to toys.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Villagers drink at their local tavern.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776834880197001ec9315e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/bedtime-stories", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that, unlike most Adam Sandler movies, this one is actually aimed at kids, so expect a lot of interest from elementary schoolers on up. The good news is that, also unlike most Sandler movies, there aren't any crass jokes, and both language (\"butt kiss\" is as wild as it gets) and sexuality (a couple of fairy-tale kisses and one brief scene of a clothed man and woman in a hot tub) are mild.

While the film is mainly a vehicle for star Jerry Seinfeld's comedy, the good news is that it's a film that even little kids can follow. Barry and friends (both human and bee) show courage by standing up for what they believe and working as a team. A few tense moments involve Barry's pell-mell flights through Manhattan and humans trying to kill bugs. There are no overarching villains or monsters but Barry does run across some dead bug bodies, some humans are held at gunpoint, and Barry and Vanessa talk about a \"suicide pact.\" While they may go over young heads, there are a few questionable jokes, like when Barry calls Bees \"honey slaves to the White man\" or his parents request he find a girl who's \"Beeish\" (the insect equivalent of being Jewish). Other jokes geared toward adults reference Larry King, Sting, and Ray Liotta, and a mosquito makes a blood-sucking lawyer joke.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate, but some good information about how bees are environmentally important.\n|Positive Messages|: The bees at first rally together to reclaim their own honey but later realize their pivotal role in keeping the environment healthy. Barry initially blows off his responsibilities in the hive but learns how important even the smallest job can be. Vanessa sticks up for Barry (before she even knows he can talk) and saves him from getting squashed, asserting the value of every creature's life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Vanessa cares about all living things, including bugs and flowers, and she protects Barry from harm. Vanessa and Adam help Barry with his court case, and the hive works together to restore the environment.\n|Diverse Representations|: The beehive has a good mix of male and female workers, and Vanessa has a large and important role. But some females are judged for their appearance -- a queen bee is called \"a man in women's clothes\" -- and characters with larger body sizes are joked about. Some characters are Jewish (well, the bee equivalent \"Beeish\"), but there's not much racial/ethnic diversity. Some jokes make light of racism (Barry calls Bees \"honey slaves to the White man\" and is accused of playing \"the species card\").\n|Violence & Scariness|: Barry imagines Vanessa crashing and blowing up. He also has a terrifying flight across Manhattan in which he's almost killed several times. People repeatedly try to kill bugs, and Barry runs across some dead bug bodies.

Some humans are held at gunpoint for their honey, and a woman is held down by police and says \"I can't breathe.\" Barry and Vanessa talk about a \"suicide pact.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Barry daydreams about Vanessa in a romantic way; he and Vanessa spend a lot of time together, but they never have more than an interspecies friendship. Mild innuendo such as \"shacking up with a grasshopper,\" jokes about bees flirting with their cousins, and interspecies dating \u200b\u200b(Barry is called Vanessa's \"little bedbug\").\n|Language|: A mosquito makes a joke about lawyers being blood-sucking parasites.

None of those incidents are actually depicted, but kids are shown being threatened, and one receives a bloody scratch. Main character Suzu (voiced by Kaho Nakamura and Kylie McNeill) is still grappling with the past trauma of her mother's death, and her sadness has left her alienated from most of her classmates over the years. With the encouragement and support of her best friend, she finds comfort (and eventually strength) by re-creating herself as a beautiful avatar in a virtual environment, emboldened by her anonymity there. Themes include curiosity and beauty coming from who you are inside. Expect some name-calling (\"idiot,\" \"loser,\" \"old fart,\" \"scumbag,\" etc.) and a use of \"damn,\" as well as jokes about possibly age-inappropriate crushes.\n|Positive Messages|: Beauty is about who you are on the inside.

Many examples of what it means to be a good friend.\n|Diverse Representations|: Characters are all Japanese.

The story (as anyone familiar with Sparks' romances could predict) is a weepy romance with dramatic twists and some heavy themes -- including child abuse, alcoholism, teen pregnancy, adultery, and murder. There are a couple of love scenes that don't show nudity but do feature close-ups of bare skin, passionate kissing, and touching. The language is occasionally strong (one \"f---king,\" plus several uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and more), and the violence can be intense and upsetting, particularly because it involves a father and his cronies beating up a son and wielding weapons against one another. Despite its heavy themes, the movie does have some positive messages, most notably about the power of forgiveness and the importance of being with someone who helps bring out the best in you.\n|Positive Messages|: It's important to forgive (yourself and those you love) to move forward in life, young love can change your life forever, and family bonds can require more than blood. The story also encourages teens to be with someone who challenges you and encourages you to be the best you can be.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tuck is a wonderful father figure to Dawson, who needs someone to care about him unconditionally. Dawson and Amanda push and challenge each other to be the best they can be and to not give up on their future. They love each other in an extraordinarily intense way for high school sweethearts, who could have easily let circumstances change their feelings.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A father severely beats up his son and threatens him. The father and his sons/nephews all beat the boy together, as well as beating up an unrelated man and leaving him unconscious. Characters are shot and killed; others are shot at and injured.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple makes love both as teens and as adults (the grown-up scene shows more skin but no actual nudity). As teens, their first time isn't explicit; viewers mostly see close-ups of their faces and backs. There's also a lot of passionate kissing. A woman commits adultery. Two different characters' unexpected pregnancies (one in high school and one in college) are discussed.\n|Language|: Fairly frequent strong langauge, including \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), and one use of \"f--king\" as part of an insult.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several brands and car makes are featured, including Apple, Chevy, Dodge, Volvo, Corvette, Mustang, Volkswagen, Le Creuset, Sprite, Budweiser, Vivitar, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: As a teen, Dawson drinks a shot of liquor that's offered to him by Amanda's father. As adults, Dawson and Amanda and other characters drink wine and beer. Amanda's husband drinks too much and even drinks and drives. Dawson's family is shown drinking (mostly beer) and it's clear they're meth dealers, even though the drug's name is never said.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77689751dd69001fe0e826": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/a-better-life", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this enlightening, sometimes heartbreaking drama about the illegal immigrant experience pulls no punches in its portrayal of a hardscrabble life, addressing the challenges that the undocumented face without lecturing -- or pandering.

You can't let life, no matter how difficult, harden you.\n|Positive Role Models|: Carlos, despite all the problems flung his way, is honest and principled. He can even find compassion for the man who wronged him.

The movie has a dark tone, and tense moments of peril and danger punctuate the story from the beginning. After Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is kidnapped, she expects the BFG (Mark Rylance) to cook her for dinner, and later she's hunted by the other giants, who love to eat children; these giants are destructive, loud, and scary when they're on screen. In one scene, the BFG plants a nightmare in Sophie's mind when she sleeps just so she'll believe him about how truly bad the other giants really are. Death is also referenced in not-so-subtle ways: Sophie bluntly states that her parents are dead, and the BFG alludes to another human child he used to be friends with who was clearly eaten by the other giants. While the scares are enough to keep the littlest audience members away (or at least with their eyes firmly covered), this tale about discovering friendship and family in the unlikeliest places also offers sweetness, humor, and heart -- as well as themes of courage, empathy, and perseverance. (Oh, and some fart jokes.)\n|Educational Value|: Like the book, the movie teaches kids about not judging others by their appearances, about the importance of friendship (no matter how unlikely it is), and the power of speaking up and asking for help. They may also learn about Nicholas Nickleby, the Charles Dickens book that Sophie is reading when she's taken by the BFG.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong themes of courage, perseverance, and empathy. Shares the book's themes about friends coming in all shapes and sizes, how even one or two individuals can make a difference, and how everyone needs someone to believe in them. Sophie and the BFG's friendship also explores how friends should stand up for each other, and their interaction with the queen reveals how you shouldn't be afraid to ask for help, even if it seems daunting.\n|Positive Role Models|: The BFG and Sophie are wonderful friends to each other. They protect, listen to, and help each other overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The queen believes Sophie and the BFG and agrees to help them. Sophie is courageous and determined.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie's tone is dark, and there's plenty of peril/danger. Sophie -- who's an orphan (she says bluntly that her parents are dead) -- is snatched away by the BFG and immediately taken to Giant Country (she screams the whole time). After she's kidnapped, Sophie believes she's going to be eaten as the Giant sautees dinner (and she lands in the skillet). She later realizes she's safe with him -- but the other nine giants are indeed human-eaters. These giants hunt for Sophie and destroy the BFG's home. They also hurt him in several tense scenes that put Sophie (and the BFG) in precarious positions as she attempts to hide from them. The BFG plants a nightmare in Sophie's mind when she sleeps just so she'll believe him about how truly bad the other giants really are. In one scene, a truck hits a giant's private parts. At one point, a giant nearly does eat Sophie, but she's saved at the last minute. The British Army invades Giant Country and subdues each of the \"bad\" giants. Several references to the last child who stayed with the BFG, whom the other Giants found and ate.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Insults like \"you're a disgrace to giants,\" and some silly potty humor as a special fizzy drink causes everyone (even the queen) to \"whizzpop\" (fart).\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie, but there's tie-in merchandise for all Disney movies, so expect apparel, games, toys, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Men who appear drunk walk around the streets below the orphanage, and Sophie yells at them. The giants drink a green fizzy drink called frobscottle, in which the bubbles go down instead of up. Although it's supposedly made from fermented snozzcumber, t's not alcoholic, seeing as Sophie is allowed to drink it (and so does the queen of England).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776832eb5d26001f1e0024": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/big-daddy", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Big Daddy is a 1999 Adam Sandler film in which Sandler plays an irresponsible man-child who \"adopts\" a young boy under false pretenses. There is frequent profanity; humor is mined from a 5-year-old saying things like, \"Is that the guy with the old balls?\" and \"But I wipe my own ass.\" Adults use variations on \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"damn.\" While the humor is on the whole typical goofy and obnoxious Sandler fare, jokes are made at the expense of overweight people, and the very idea of two men falling in love and showing their affection by flirting and kissing is seen as something awkward. There is an incredible amount of product placement, and characters repeatedly mentioning McDonald's, Hooters, Pepperidge Farm, Pepsi, and assorted Frito-Lay products. For comedic effect, a homeless man makes reference to taking too many mushrooms in the 1970s. Expect beer and alcohol drinking. A father reminds his son of the time he found a bag of marijuana in his desk. Overall, for those who enjoy Adam Sandler movies, this is typical of the formula he used to great success in the 1990s, and by this point, you either like it or you don't.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is too ludicrous to have any real positive messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: No real positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comedic pratfalls.

The movie is an unconventional origin story that focuses on the power of brotherhood, friendship, and using your gifts to help others. The main group of kids includes strong, smart female contributors. One of the film's main themes is about coping with grief, as the main character's beloved older brother (his only immediate family) tragically dies early in the film; Hiro's sadness may be hard for sensitive kids. Another near death is very upsetting, and there are sometimes-intense confrontations between the movie's scary supervillain and the protagonists that injure but don't kill people. On the other hand, the central robot, Baymax, was designed to heal not hurt, and his moral code influences other characters in positive ways. With its refreshingly diverse cast and uplifting message, Big Hero 6 is a captivating adventure story for the entire family.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn some scientific terms and ideas about robotics, and they'll be encouraged to pursue science and technology projects.\n|Positive Messages|: Very sweet messages about honoring the memory of the departed, recognizing the importance of healing, encouraging the furthering of a legacy, seeking justice versus revenge, and surrounding yourself with friends and family when you're going through a tough time. Hiro's grief journey will show kids that getting through tragedy is sad but possible with a little help from those who love you. The movie also stresses education, particularly in science and technology. A bit of \"fat\" humor centered on Baymax's size and round belly, but it doesn't feel mean spirited. Major themes include empathy, courage, curiosity, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tadashi is an amazing big brother; he's supportive and loving but also willing to steer Hiro in a different direction. And he puts himself in danger to save his beloved professor. Baymax's mission is to help and heal people; his moral code influences other characters in positive ways. Hiro is a genius who genuinely loves and looks up to his brother and his brother's friends. Aunt Cass loves her nephews dearly and wants to be close to them. The lab friends are all smart and there for Hiro after Tadashi dies. The Big Hero 6 includes strong, smart female contributors, and the characters are a diverse group.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A terrible fire kills Tadashi (the main character's beloved older brother) and his professor. Hiro and Tadashi are orphans, so that leaves Hiro with no immediate family except for his guardian, Aunt Cass. Action scenes can be intense and include robot death matches between remote-controlled robots. The masked supervillain (who can be very scary) sends microbots after Hiro and his friends. Hiro reprograms Baymax to \"destroy,\" leading the robot to injure their friends and nearly kill the villain. The villain squares off against the Big Hero Six, all of whom have different super weapons -- but none is a gun. In one scene, it looks like another character is going to sacrifice himself; it's really upsetting to watch.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Nerd\" is used, but mostly in a positive way (\"nerd school,\" \"nerd lab,\" \"just a bunch of nerds\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Related merchandise/tie-ins are available in stores: figurines, plush dolls, games, books, apparel, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: No overt alcohol or drug use (although adults do consume drinks at a reception), but Baymax acts \"drunk\" when his battery life is depleted.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768373c3c2a001fbce99b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/big-mommas-house-2", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this movie pushes the PG-13 envelope, most often at the expense of female bodies.

Racist stereotypes are in play throughout the film, especially through a hypersexualized young Colombian woman. Catholicism is regularly mocked as backward and repressed, and there are gay jokes. There's also adultery, public displays of (more than) affection, and brief nudity (a woman's naked behind and side are visible as she skinny-dips).

Catholicism mocked as backward and repressed. Gay jokes. Specifically, Nuria -- a young Colombian woman -- is objectified by the camera (nude scene, yoga pose of just her butt) and portrayed as being obsessed with sex. Main Colombian character is whitewashed through the casting of English actor Ben Barnes. Ellie's knowledge of tantra and martial arts -- and the fact that she lived in Cambodia for three months -- are supposed to be jokes but diminish entire Asian countries in the name of providing \"exotic\" fun facts about a White woman. Same-sex attraction is used as a punchline: Missy calls her mother a \"part-time lesbian,\" while the mother herself calls her attraction to women \"a fetish.\" In a rare positive move, Colombian supporting characters Nuria and Madonna are played by actors of Colombian descent.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Physical comedy includes people falling fully dressed into a pool and Don getting slapped or punched by each of the women in his life.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The very first scene includes a discussion of oral sex and a man about to perform it on his dressed (except for her underwear) partner.

She also fondles him at the dinner table. Premarital sex is discussed between an engaged couple. The entire family discusses their mother's discovery of tantric sex and her \"9-hour orgasm.\" Two loud sex scenes include exes who do it for old times' sake and a virgin who promptly wants to do it again after his first time. Parents discuss adultery, and another set of parents talks about sexual orientation having an open marriage.

When Adam thinks he might die, he records a good-bye message for his parents and his high school crush (they share a single kiss at the end). Language, including bathroom references, includes \"damn,\" \"jeez,\" \"suckers,\" \"stupid,\" \"shut up,\" \"knucklehead,\" \"psychopath,\" \"insane,\" and \"fool.\" A man suggests that it would be \"weird\" to offer to accompany another man going pee in the woods at night; another man seems put off by his male partner clinging to him following a motor crash. Stereotypical depictions of both Americans and Canadians.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can learn about protecting the environment and getting involved in activist causes to try to bring about social change. The ending suggests the solution is for governments to protect lands.\n|Positive Messages|: The film aims to convey an environmental message about protecting wildlife and natural habitats from invasive and damaging human activities like deep oil drilling. There are other messages about making positive uses of having a platform, due to fame or a wide social media following -- potentially by taking a stand on a worthwhile issue. There are a couple of lines about \"fake news,\" including one that people will believe anything if it's repeated often enough. Families stick together. It's important to be media literate and critical of corporate messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bigfoot wants to make use of his fame for something more significant than personal profit. He wants to show his son, Adam, that \"one person can make a difference.\" Adam's classmates and school principal want to exploit him to get close to Bigfoot. Adam uses his tech savvy to help his father's videos go viral, though he initially does this for selfish purposes. Later, when his dad goes missing, he and his mom put their own lives in danger to go look for him. A stereotypical Texan oil man stashes his Stetson, dresses up as a progressive, and records soothing ads to fool people into believing his company is environmentally friendly. He says if anything goes wrong with their oil drilling, they'll \"issue a standard apology.\" A man suggests it would be \"weird\" to offer to accompany another man going pee in the woods at night; another man seems put off by his male partner clinging to him following a motor crash. A business agent is only concerned with profits and making a commission. Stereotypical depictions of Americans and Canadians.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon violence involving animated characters (humans and animals) runs the gambit from guards shooting tranquilizer darts to characters crashing, falling off cliffs, shooting down raging rapids, and flying over waterfalls, to wild animals threatening humans, to people being shoved down mining shaft and chased by killer drones over rollercoaster-like mining tracks. A \"hired gun\" handcuffs Adam and attempts to kill him and his family. He says he once used a bomb to blow up a foster home when he was a kid. Bigfoot and Adam are both nearly crushed by falling constructions and blown up by ticking bombs. When Adam thinks he might die, he records a good-bye message for his parents and high school crush.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adam has a crush on his classmate Emma. She thinks he's \"cute,\" but he's too shy to ask her out until the end of the movie. Adam's mom wants to tell him about the first time she and his father kissed. Adam and Emma kiss at the end, prompting Adam's bigfoot toes to pop out of his shoes. A talk show host flirts with Bigfoot, complimenting his looks and touching his muscles.\n|Language|: \"Damn,\" \"jeez,\" \"jeesh,\" \"suckers,\" \"stupid,\" \"shoot,\" \"shut up,\" \"knucklehead,\" \"psychopath,\" \"insane,\" \"fool.\" Some mild bathroom references.\n|Products & Purchases|: Though characters are protesting big oil drilling, they stop at the same \"bad\" company's gas station to fill up the tank on their family van. They drink so many to-go coffees (with a Starbucks-like logo) that they end a long drive with a pile of disposable cups in their car. Corporations are shown to be untrustworthy.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a3c3c2a001fbcbcbf": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/bill-teds-excellent-adventure", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is about two Southern California teens (Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) who have little respect for authority and actively disobey their parents. But the tone is very lighthearted, and the characters seem to have the best intentions (\"be excellent to each other\") during their adventures through time. Expect some comic violence; appropriately, the Dark Ages is where the duo encounters the most life-threatening -- but still comic -- situations. On the iffier side, girls are treated as sex objects to the point that mentor/guide Rufus (George Carlin) \"gives\" the boys two girls they met in Medieval England as a reward for passing their history test.\n|Positive Messages|: Overall, the message is to \"be excellent to each other.\" It's important to work together for a goal (in this case, to save the world).\n|Positive Role Models|: Bill and Ted don't pay attention in class and literally require divine intervention to save their grades -- but they're also sincere and well-meaning, and they try to be decent guys. Ted's dad treats him badly and yells at him. The boys steal Ted's dad's keys,  let people out of jail, and generally disobey their parents. Girls are treated as sex objects (two are \"given\" to Bill and Ted as a reward for passing their history test).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of comic violence; no one gets hurt. Ted falls down the stairs of a medieval castle, and Bill thinks Ted has been stabbed and killed. Bill is almost stabbed as well, but Ted knocks the assailant out. Bill and Ted are almost decapitated. Billy the Kid causes a barroom brawl and later shoots a light out in modern-day San Dimas. Genghis Khan destroys a sporting goods store with a bat.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of lighthearted sexual innuendo. Bill and Ted refer to all women as \"babes\" and take turns staring at Bill's mom's cleavage. Missy and Bill's dad make out in Bill's bedroom. Bill's dad is married to a much-younger trophy wife. Genghis Khan stops eating and starts making out with a servant girl.

The immature humor is full of sex jokes and innuendo that's targeted toward teenagers; for example, Billy is excited because it's \"nudie magazine day,\" where he receives magazines with titles like Drunk Chicks. An older maid makes continuous sexual advances at the protagonist (including a request to take her shirt off for him). There is lots of profanity throughout the film, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and use of the word \"retarded.\" The film contains some scenes of binge drinking. Billy is often hazed by the bullies of each grade he attends. Rude behavior rules. The ending features a positive message of accomplishment and resilience.\n|Positive Messages|: The main character is an unmotivated heir to a hotel fortune who must learn to apply himself in order to succeed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters are too silly, strange, and one-dimensional to be seen as positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In a high school auditorium, a character pulls out a gun and starts shooting. He is shot at by another character armed with a rifle and scope. A clown seems to fall to its death at a party. A station wagon full of a family of bullies spins out of control and goes off a cliff.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sexual innuendo. The lead character is excited because it's \"nudie magazine day;\" he goes to the mailbox and takes out magazines with titles like Drunk Chicks. His teacher and eventual love interest helps him study by quizzing him on questions and removing an article of clothing each time he gets a question right; she does not get undressed. Billy and his friends ask each other the question, \"Who would you rather bone?\" concerning two famous people. Billy draws his teacher in a suggestive pose with the caption, \"Do me, Billy!\" His principal gives him a valentine that reads, \"I'm horny!\" In the tent where Billy studies, his bathroom is covered in pictures of naked women (not clearly seen), with speakers that make noises like women having orgasms.

While the \"presence\" is never seen, its existence results in many gory, blood-soaked sequences. There are shootings, stabbings, hideous accidents, zombie-like humans in attack mode, fiery explosions, and more. Plus, the main characters are in dire peril as they undertake a long, harrowing ride down a river -- while blindfolded. You can also expect frequent swearing, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and more. A nude couple is briefly glimpsed having sex, and a loving couple kisses and embraces. Characters drink, one very much to excess. Based on a novel by Josh Malerman, this thriller/horror film isn't for kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Demonstrates the power of parental commitment and bravery. In the face of monstrous evil, humanity has the potential to survive.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroine is loyal, courageous, compassionate, and perseveres; back story shows her evolution as a formidable, loving parent. Ethnic diversity throughout.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Suspense and fear play throughout. Although monstrous creatures or beings are unseen, their presence (seen and heard only as raging wind) incites mayhem, pandemic suicide and deaths, gore, and destruction. Many deaths take place in close-up shots: (i.e., scissors to neck; car explosion, point-blank shooting). Bodies, some bloody, are strewn in multiple settings, from a variety of violent causes. Children are in danger from unseen monsters on a river with turbulent rapids, human predators.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A naked couple is briefly seen having sex.

The movie's theme is about women standing up to their male oppressors and showing that, when they work together, they're unbeatable. Rape overtones are consistent, but the women aren't harmed sexually. That said, violence is nonstop: Sometimes it's silly fantasy, but many other times it's graphically brutal. The main villain cuts his victims' faces off while they're still alive, and people (including a family with children) are gunned down, with blood splatter. Frequent drinking includes comically downing shots and having margaritas to celebrate sisterhood. One character smokes, and it's implied in one scene that a character gets a sniff of cocaine, giving her a boost of confidence. Characters swear often, using words like \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and more). While main character Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) doesn't quite make it to antihero status -- she's self-absorbed and makes many self-serving decisions -- Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Renee Montoyao (Rosie Perez) consistently put others' needs ahead of their own. Overall, the female characters are diverse in terms of ethnicity, age, and sexual identity, and they're all shown to be clever, tough, and resilient. All of the movie's men, on the other hand, are either bad or disappointing. Themes include female empowerment, friendship, and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid violence and mayhem is clear idea that when women look out for each other and stand together, they can overcome men who have bad intentions. Also themes of female empowerment, friendship, teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Birds of Prey are vigilantes, but they're working to save a teenager's life and bring villains to justice. Renee is trying to clean up crime in Gotham City. The five women are tough, fearless, strong, though Harley seems to think of herself as a screwup/bad person. A teen survives by stealing; characters are devoted to revenge. The women cover a wide range of ages and diversity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very violent. Guns (including automatic weapons) are prevalent; people shot in head and face, with blood splatter. Knives, crossbow, baseball bat, grenades. In scene shown a few times, entire family is massacred with gun, including kids; blood, dead bodies shown. A character known to cut victims' faces off does so to each member of a family, also slitting one's throat. A villain feeds a person to an animal. A character shoots darts in enemies' throats so they'll die a slower, more painful death. Characters hit by cars. Graphic threats of violence made to a teenager. A destructive act of vandalism creates a firework-laden explosion. In separate scenes, a woman is hit in the face several times, strangled, tied up. A man's legs are broken in slow motion. A person set on fire. A body blows apart when a grenade explodes. Lots of cartoonish action violence, some of it clearly silly -- as when Harley uses a \"fun gun\" (it shoots beanbags, paint, confetti). Lots of self-defense-style kicking and hitting, often with household weapon like baseball bat or bowling ball. In several scenes, men behave in ways that suggest they're about to sexually assault a woman, but then it seems that was not their intent. A woman is forced to dance on top of a table; her boyfriend is ordered to rip her dress off, her bra is exposed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Tight/revealing clothing. Harley makes a few girl-to-girl jokes about breasts.\n|Language|: Several uses and varieties of \"ass\" and \"f--k,\" including \"a--hole\" and \"motherf----r.\" Also \"balls,\" \"bitches,\" \"d--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"slut,\" \"t-t,\" \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Peeps and Mike &amp; Ike candies are seen in a grocery bag. A joke is made about Olive Garden that puts it in a positive light. A villain lives in a lavish penthouse. People are willing to kill for an expensive diamond.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of drinking. Harley is often seen doing shots and drinking in a way that suggests fun/bonding with friends; she clearly gets drunk and says that's when she gets her best ideas. One character is a \"day drinker,\" and it's implied that she may have a drinking problem. Several scenes take place in a bar. Adults give a teen a drink. A character smokes cigarettes. During a shoot-out, bags of cocaine are shot up, and the powder floats through the air -- it's implied Harley sniffs it and it has a favorable outcome. One blink-or-you'll-miss-it moment shows clubgoers popping pills.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776836880197001ec936b4": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-black-cauldron", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this dark Disney animated feature (based on the Prydain books by Lloyd Alexander) will have much greater appeal for those who enjoy ghost stories and war epics than for fans of musical comedy. There are no songs, and even the comic relief involves violent images. The Horned King twice attempts to murder the hero, skeletons come to life and attack people, and witches use magic to hurl objects. For grade-school kids, the cute sidekicks and rapid pace will be appealing, but the many frightening images could fuel many a nightmare. Older kids and preteens interested in fantasy will enjoy the mystical plot.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie offers positive messages about working together and believing in yourself and your friends. That said, characters do rely on weapons to solve problems.\n|Positive Role Models|: There's clear delineation between good and evil characters. Taran is a brave (albeit initially reluctant) hero. Girls may be frustrated at the non-centrality of the princess, but Princess Eilonwy makes a strong showing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Forbidden Forest and the enchanted marsh contain lots of scary creatures.

As in all superhero movies, there's plenty of violence -- in this case, mostly brutal hand-to-hand combat that gets quite intense, with bloody injuries and even deaths. Although there are a few shoot-outs with super-powered guns/cannons (as well as some cold-blooded killings), the majority of the action features spear and blade fighting. That said, some confrontations do include larger, explosive battles and very destructive car chases. Language and sexual content are pretty minimal: a few uses of \"s--t\" and \"hell\" and a couple of quick kisses. Set mostly in the fictional African nation of Wakanda, the movie features not only the first mostly Black ensemble cast in superhero-film history (Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira, and Daniel Kaluuya co-star), but also an all-female royal guard and a brilliant female inventor/engineer. Families who see Black Panther will have plenty to talk about afterward, from its portrayal of race and gender to the overall importance of having Black superheroes as main characters, rather than sidekicks.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes teamwork, communication, loyalty, integrity, courage, and friendship. Highlights the abilities of women and people of color in leading roles. Explores the necessity of global compassion and outreach and the idea that, as human beings, more unites us than separates us. Duty, ritual, justice, and tradition are very important to the Wakandans. An important theme of the movie is learning that those who may seem perfect usually aren't; we all have flaws and secrets. But we also aren't responsible for the choices of those who came before us.\n|Positive Role Models|: T'Challa is a born leader who's thoughtful, patient, and compassionate. Okoye, Nakia, and Shuri are strong, smart, capable, and brave, and Shuri is an inventive tech genius. Even the main villain is complicated and thought-provoking. A highly respected character is revealed to have made some pretty big mistakes in the past.\n|Diverse Representations|: Positive representation of Marvel's first Black superhero; ensemble cast is largely Black. Women have agency and are shown to be strong, smart, capable, and courageous.\n|Violence & Scariness|: More close-up fights than in previous Marvel films, with more explosive, widespread violence. One-on-one ritual battles are intense (with bloody wounds, stabbings, etc.), full of moments when it seems like a character is going to die. A couple of deaths (both real and presumed) are particularly emotional. Weapons used in full-scale battle scenes include spears, curved knives, armored war animals. Super-powered guns/cannons that have the power to obliterate vehicles in one shot. Bad guys shoot bystanders and enemies, sometimes in cold blood. A long, explosive car chase causing lots of destruction. Dead bodies shown. Flashback to T'Challa's father's death. Brief footage from 1992 LA riots on TV. Black Panther rescues women from armed Nigerian soldiers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses and some flirting. One couple calls each other \"my love\" in a flirtatious/charged manner. Klaue smuggles a sensitive package in the crotch area of his pants.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and \"hell\"; one character makes a middle-finger gesture. A couple of Wakandan characters use the historically accurate word \"colonizer\" as a derisive/dismissive way of referring to white people/those in power. On the flip side, characters use the word \"savage\" a couple of times as an insult to the Wakandans.\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera: Toyota Land Cruiser, a top-of-the-line Lexus (which has been heavily featured in commercials), BBC News. Off camera: Marvel-branded merchandise is everywhere, including video games, apparel, action figures, and other products associated with all the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult extras drink in the background of a casino scene; a more central character orders a whiskey.

Here, she reconnects with her estranged sister-figure (Florence Pugh) and grapples with her past while being pursued by a deadly new enemy. While a certain amount of suspense is removed by the fact that the film takes place before existing MCU movies (i.e., we know Natasha will survive), violence is frequent and often intense: Expect tons of physical fighting (often with knives), explosions, extreme moments of peril, shoot-outs, and stabbings. Language includes \"bitch\" and \"s--t,\" and characters drink alcohol in moderation.The movie's feminist story is ultimately about promoting women's independence from men who believe that women exist to be used by them. Characters exhibit courage and teamwork, and there are themes of family that may resonate with viewers who've experienced adoption, foster care, or feelings of abandonment.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of women's independence from those (especially men) who would control them, sisterhood, and finding your family. Teamwork and creative thinking help characters succeed. Examines concept of complicity when it comes to helping those who would do others harm: If you're not directly involved, are you still culpable?\n|Positive Role Models|: Women are strong, clever, intelligent, powerful -- even more so when they work together. Natasha has courage and integrity; she and other female colleagues put themselves in danger to save thousands of women. Alexei has many flaws but also genuinely cares about Natasha and Yelena. Dreykov is a manipulative, selfish villain. All main characters are White; diverse representation within supporting cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Heavy live-action comic book violence, including physical combat with knives, punches, hitting with a blunt instrument, kicks. Explosions, destruction, a massive avalanche put people in peril. Child threatens soldiers with a gun. Shoot-outs. Frequent life-endangering peril, including vehicle crashes and severe falls. Children are shown to be in deep distress while being separated from their parents. A montage of the Red Room's training process reveals it to be ruthless; many young girls don't survive. Upsetting scenes where surgery/medical procedures are implied or getting underway.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Moment of innuendo between a married couple.

A character pops some pills and drinks from a flask. Sex isn't an issue.\n|Positive Messages|: Makes political commentary about people in power who use their power only to stay in power vs. other figures who believe in helping others. Draws a fairly clear line between the two, but then violence and sensationalism are used to get to the \"truth.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Travis Block always tries to do the right thing, even though he sometimes doesn't succeed. He's led a violent life and has run away from mistakes. But he still tries. Mira Jones is a reporter who's determined to get to the truth and help people, but her journalism skills are a little lacking (she doesn't seem to care about facts or sources).\n|Diverse Representations|: Lead character Travis Block is a White man.

It's a very violent film, with multiple fights and killings, some gruesome and disturbing. Characters are killed by gunfire at close range and in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Characters dangle over the side of skyscrapers; multiple fingers are broken graphically; people are gagged and choked; a man's eyes are poked out (how much is seen depends upon the version of the film). There are repeated close shots of bloodied corpses and dying characters. While there's no overt sex, it's implied, and there's some partial nudity (breasts), passionate kissing, and several scenes that border on rough or nonconsensual sex. Smoking is pervasive; multiple scenes show characters drinking, and the hero often turns to alcohol when he's under stress. Editor's note: Families should avoid the earliest version (1982) of the movie; instead, go with Ridley Scott's 1992 \"Director's Cut\" or 2007's \"Final Cut,\" a remastered version by Scott with few changes from the 1992 release.\n|Positive Messages|: It's 2019, and progress hasn't been kind. The city is in chaos: polluted, gloomy, overcrowded, and cruel. Darkness and steady rain enclose the loud, gaudy, and teeming streets. The film, which can be seen as a cautionary tale, poses some profound questions: What does it mean to be human? In a tortured world, who can be trusted? And, while we strive senselessly for immortality, will we destroy ourselves?\n|Positive Role Models|: Deckhard, the closest thing to a hero in Blade Runner, is flawed at best. Given a dangerous mission on the side of \"good,\" he recklessly fights, drinks, kills, and falls passionately in love. In almost every other instance, characters are not what they seem; they move from good to evil and back again in the blink of an eye. Scientists, law enforcement, strippers, street people and even replicants (androids) continually surprise us. Both men and women prove to be savage fighters and/or conscienceless killers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Blood, howling, and anguish accompany the countless violent actions in this film. Characters are killed by gunfire at close range and brutal hand-to-hand combat. Characters dangle over the side of skyscrapers; multiple fingers are broken graphically; people are gagged and choked; a man's eyes are poked out (how much is seen depends upon the version of the film). There are repeated close shots of bloodied corpses and dying characters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No overt sex acts, but sexuality is pervasive in many scenes. A stripper undresses, and her breasts are seen briefly. Other females wear revealing clothing. There are a number of passionate kisses (one between two males; one in which a man kisses a dead female lover). Most of the sexual behavior is hard-edged, with little tenderness or love expressed.\n|Language|: A few curse words (dependent upon the version) \"ass,\" \"f--ker.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: In the dystopia the film portrays, loud, bright, intrusive advertising is everywhere. It's part of the fabric of the city. A few recognizable products are shown: Coca Cola, Atari, Budweiser, RCA, TDK, Tsing Tao, Bulova.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink alcoholic beverages in many scenes; the hero drinks hard liquor throughout the film, at least once to excess.

Violence is frequent and strong, with brutal fighting, guns and shooting, stabbing, crashes and explosions, and bloody wounds/blood spurts. Women (some human, some holograms/sculptures) are shown naked -- mainly breasts and bottoms -- and a man's pubic hair is shown. It's implied that the main character has sex with a prostitute, with his hologram girlfriend superimposed over her. Sex noises are heard in a red-light district, with vague sexual images glimpsed through frosted glass. Expect a few uses of \"f--k\"; characters also drink from time to time, but never to excess. The movie isn't without its flaws, and it certainly could have gone a bit deeper, but there's enough thoughtful, visually spellbinding stuff here to make it well worth seeing.\n|Positive Messages|: Tackles complicated, big-picture themes without easy answers, such as the value of life, what it means to be human, and what it means to be alive. Asks what it means if a being is artificial but feels alive.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters tend to be somewhat violent and destructive, with few consequences for their actions, but they sometimes show touching hints of understanding and compassion. Women are a big part of the story, and some are capable of taking action, though the main story is male-driven.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Guns and shooting. Stabbing. Trickling blood and bloody wounds. Crashes and explosions. Brutal fight sequences. Martial arts fighting. Violence against women. Gun shot to head, with blood spatter. Applying \"glue\" to heal wound. A drink glass is smashed and crushed into a character's hand, blood dripping down. Character's back broken. Brief raging, shouting.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several women (some human, some sculptures/holograms) are shown topless. Naked bottoms. Brief hints of full-frontal nudity. Male bodies lying on tables, pubic hair visible. Main character kisses two women at once (one is an intangible hologram, and the other is a prostitute); sex is implied but not shown. (The prostitute wakes up in his bed.) Prostitutes hang out; sex sounds and obscured sex vaguely seen through frosted window.\n|Language|: A few uses of \"f--k,\" including once written, plus \"bulls--t\" and \"pr--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Peugeot logo shown on car, Sony logo used more than once.

But this blended-family story is no Brady Bunch: Like all of Sandler's comedies, there's plenty of sexual innuendo, with allusions to breasts, masturbation, porn, body size, and more. One couple on the vacation often makes out publicly and refers to their sex life, and adults drink socially at dinners and parties. Language includes the occasional \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" and \"s--t,\" as well as \"butt hole,\" \"crap,\" etc. All of that said, there are some worthy take-aways about parenting here, and step-families may particularly enjoy the positive messages about the importance of strong blended families.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's best messages are that parents need to be reliable and show up/listen/be present for their kids and that all parents could use a little help sometimes to see what's going on with their children. The movie also has a positive pro-blended family message.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite their flaws, Jim and Lauren are trying to be the best single parents possible, even though they could both use help. Jim is patient and loving with his daughters, as is Lauren with her sons. Lauren and Jim help each other's kids in various ways. The five kids all love their parents and want them to be happy with someone who deserves them.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick violence includes a woman falling on a man, a man and a boy falling off an ostrich, and lions eating prey (off camera, but you hear roaring and chewing noises).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: At the hotel, a married couple is constantly kissing passionately and several times discusses having sex. The wife in that couple always wears dresses that show off her ample cleavage. References to sex, pornography, and masturbation: A 14-year-old son has a porn magazine's centerfold (with his babysitter's face taped on top) hidden under his bed. A woman suggestively tells her boyfriend \"I'm so sore\" on the phone.

It centers on messages of empathy and inclusion, the benefits of perseverance and hard work, and the importance of family support. That said, it sometimes feels as if it glosses over many of the challenges that Oher and his \"rescuer\" (socialite Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock) must have faced when building their relationship. And while the movie alludes to the racial prejudice Michael dealt with (some scenes depict characters who are blatantly racist), it skirts the topic instead of truly tackling it. For example, many of the movie's Black characters -- including Michael's mom -- are portrayed as impoverished, drug addicted, or both, and Black men are seen as dangerous and threatening. Still, Oher's life story is inarguably encouraging. While language and sexual content are quite mild, you can expect a couple of brief violent scenes, references to drug use, social drinking, and words including \"ass\" and the \"N\" word.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie's message is one of inclusion -- that no barrier, including race or income, should get in the way of being empathetic and doing right by others. Another lesson: Hard work and perseverance pay off. But there's a hint of condescension in the movie's approach to the topic in that it focuses on the White, wealthy Tuohy family as Michael's \"rescuer.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Michael is a lesson in perseverance and fortitude, while also remaining kind and thoughtful to others, especially children. Leigh Anne sets a positive example as an affluent socialite who's empathetic and lends a helping hand to a child and doesn't let go (her entire family is supportive, as are the teachers). But some characters freely indulge in racism, and the movie can be seen as reinforcing both the \"White savior\" and \"magical Negro\" cinematic clich\u00e9s.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main character Michael is a Black teen with deep emotions about his all-White school environment. Economic diversity is a plot point: Film tries to tackle wealth inequality by contrasting Michael's upbringing to the Tuohys' wealthy East Memphis life. But many Black characters -- including Michael's mom -- are portrayed as impoverished, drug addicted, or both, and Black men are depicted as dangerous and threatening. Racist behavior throughout: assuming Michael steals, calling him \"colored boy\" and \"King Kong,\" and insinuating that he's a threat to the Tuohys' White daughter. S.J. wears a headdress in a Thanksgiving pageant and complains about being cast as \"Indian #3\" because of \"multicultural bias.\" Strong women like Leigh Anne and teachers Mrs. Boswell and Miss Sue are important in Michael's journey, but there are a couple of sexist jokes about cheerleading and girls' volleyball. Movie can be see as reinforcing both the \"White savior\" and \"magical Negro\" cinematic clich\u00e9s.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A fight in a drug dealer's apartment nearly leads to gunfire. A gun is brandished, and a character alludes to \"packing\" a weapon. Some jaw-breaking action on the football field and a scary car accident. Flashback scenes show children being wrested from their mother without her consent, which may be traumatic to watch.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Married characters lovingly kiss and make out; references to \"tapping that.\" Ogling. A joke about cutting off genitals.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"ass\" (which Leigh Anne points out as being inappropriate), \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"tits,\" \"bitch,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"crazy,\" and \"oh my God.\" One use of the \"N\" word and a few racist terms like \"colored\" and \"redskins.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: BMW logo visible; one character owns a number of Taco Bell franchises, and that company and other fast-food restaurants are mentioned by name. The family goes to a Borders bookstore.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Social beer and wine drinking. One scene shows an adult offering a teenager beer; he takes one sip.

The main character, Greg, appears addicted to painkillers, but quickly finds himself taking drugs in the form of \"crystals\" that he believes give him superpowers and transport him to an imagined paradise. He begins living with a homeless woman, Isabel, despite his grown daughter attempting to bring him back into her life. In one world, Greg and Isabel are accomplished doctors living in a chalet with ocean views. In the other, they live in a homeless encampment, Isabel apparently sidelines as a prostitute (a man asks her for a \"BJ and a finger in the butt\"), and they use their \"powers\" to hurt people by tossing them out windows, knocking them down, or crushing their cars. Beyond the crystals Greg and Isabel take, there's also alcohol consumption and references to heroin on the city streets. Language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"boner,\" \"bitch,\" \"douchebag,\" and \"screwing.\" Isabel shoots a man.

Greg ultimately opts for staying in the world and trying to mend his relationship with his kids.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man falls and hits his head on a desk, passing out. Greg props his body up against a window and, in another scene, we see the man fall from the window several floors down to the sidewalk below.

Isabel and Greg use their \"powers\" to knock people over at a skating rink and crush two men in a van. Isabel shoots a man.

Isabel appears to be acting as a prostitute in a couple of scenes, including one where she pulls her shirt down to show more of her breasts and asks a man what he wants. He replies a \"BJ and a finger in the butt.\" A drug dealer shows his bare bottom and blows Greg a kiss.

It transports them to an alternate world that is blissfully peaceful and beautiful. A man offers Greg \"junk,\" \"mud,\" \"skag,\" \"caballo.\" Greg's son smokes a joint. Greg takes prescription medication. Isabel puts a pill in Greg's whiskey. They drink champagne at an event. She smokes cigarettes and the two share a joint.

The main character Omar (Jimmy Gonzales) runs an orphanage for parent-less boys, and he continuously models integrity, hard work, resilience, and honesty for them despite his own challenges, including bank debt that could shut the orphanage down. Though the boys are mostly cheerful, they do talk about some traumatic past experiences. They share the scars on their bodies from abuse, like getting cut by metal coat hangers, and they talk about losing parents to bullets, drugs, and prison. One boy's brother was said to have been shot, and we see young men shooting at each other in the background of a street scene. The main character's father drowned when he was little, and he continues to have nightmares involving water and drowning. He also flashes back to his own childhood living on the street. Two boys get in a fight on a boat and fall overboard; one can't swim so an adult has to dive in to save him.

There are some scenes of peril (explosions, hostage situations, evil cats) in the TV-show-within-a-movie, but after the first few action-packed minutes of the movie, it's made clear to the audience that it's all manufactured. There's also a  tense, potentially scary fire during the movie's climax. But most of the movie's content is age-appropriate for its intended audience.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain, not educate. But kids may learn a bit about how Hollywood works.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has a sweetly positive messages about loyalty, determination, and teamwork. Characters who resist others' affection eventually learn to embrace it, and Bolt discovers that being loved is much more important than having super powers.\n|Positive Role Models|: Penny and Mittens are strong female characters, and Rhino is a courageous sidekick. Bolt is at first melancholy about not being a real super dog, but he overcomes his initial blues to find his true courage.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The peril is mostly in the TV show within the movie. After an early sequence (which could be intense for younger or more sensitive kids) it's made clear that the violence is manufactured, since the audience (unlike Bolt) sees the crew setting off explosions, catching stuntmen, etc. In the \"real\" world, there are cartoonish pratfalls and slapsticky violence, but nothing too disturbing -- until a tense, scary fire during the movie's climax that puts a central character in danger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: A couple of mild insults (like \"stupid\") among the animals.\n|Products & Purchases|: Featured brands include The New Yorker, Tiger Beat, U-Haul, The Tonight Show (but not with a recognizable host), and several Las Vegas hotels, like the Bellagio; New York, New York; Bally's; and Caesar's Palace.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a6223d5a3001f50405c": {"verified": false, "updated": "2022-07-28"}, "plex://movie/5d776c1a594b2b001e6eb216": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-book-of-henry", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Book of Henry is a drama with very dark subject matter.

A man kills himself off-screen; viewers hear the gunshot. A man is sexually abusing his sixth-grade stepdaughter; viewers see the girl's sad face and watch her crouching in her room at night. A woman visits a young boy in the hospital; after he tells her he thinks she's pretty, she gives him an inappropriate full-on-the-lips kiss. Two women drink wine until they're giggly and silly; one character drinks to excess and misses work. Cursing includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"s--t,\" and more, and two boys teach their mother how to flip the bird.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's tone and messages are muddled; it deals with hard topics like abuse, death, and grief but doesn't offer clear take-aways around these themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Susan is a warm and loving mother, and the depth of feeling she displays for her son and a foster daughter is compelling. But since she shows that she's willing to literally commit murder at her son's direction, she's hardly a positive role model. Christina is portrayed as a distressed damsel, waiting passively for rescue.\n|Violence & Scariness|: No blood or gore, but plenty of disturbing imagery. A child has two seizures, spends time in a hospital bed with bandages and tubes, and ultimately dies in his mother's arms as his mother and brother cry over him. A young boy hatches elaborate plans to commit a murder; his mother decides to follow those plans, buying a gun with the intent of killing her neighbor. A man commits suicide off screen; viewers hear a gunshot and are told he's killed himself.

It addresses issues related to sibling rivalry (particularly an older child's fears that there will be less love after a new baby arrives) and has a fair bit of peril, though much of it is played for laughs. Expect chases, nick-of-time escapes, and plenty of slapstick confrontations between babies and children/adults. There are also potentially scary scenes imagined by 7-year-old Tim (attacking animals, creepy hallways, looming figures) and a sequence in which two kids investigate a mysterious dark room and subsequently get captured. Not surprisingly for a film about babies, there's also plenty of body/potty humor, including an explosive fake-barf sequence, bare baby bottoms, and use of words like \"fart,\" \"poop,\" and \"doody.\" Other language includes some insults, and there's a scene in which it's implied that Tim tried a Long Island Ice Tea and didn't like it (champagne is also served in first class). The way the movie treats puppies -- like a factory-produced product -- may bother some viewers, and the fact that the boys travel to Las Vegas on their own may need some explaining ... as will the movie's take on where babies come from. But there are clear messages about the value of teamwork and the fact that there is enough love for everyone in a family. And parents who loved Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock will surely laugh (Boss Baby is basically a mini Jack Donaghy).\n|Educational Value|: Intended to educate, rather than entertain, though there are lessons about love and teamwork. On the other hand, it perpetuates an incorrect idea about where babies come from.\n|Positive Messages|: There's enough love for everyone in a family; it's not a fixed quantity that can run out -- the more you give, the more you get. Working together toward a common purpose can pay off -- and you might even find yourself growing to like someone you never thought you could. Imagination plays an important role in childhood. On the downside, puppies are looked at/treated as products, rather than animals with needs and feelings, and the world of business is portrayed as pretty competitive/cutthroat.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both Tim and Boss Baby do and say many mean things to each other, but eventually they learn to work together and appreciate each other. Boss Baby has trouble with expressing/understanding feelings and frequently throws money at problems to solve them. Tim's parents are loving but fairly clueless, in the vein of many cartoon moms and dads. Bad guys are manipulative and evil but are clearly intended to be villains. Main cast isn't diverse, but the hordes of babies at BabyCorp HQ are much more multicultural. Some stereotyping (a larger baby is fixated on eating cookies; Tim is mocked for his \"girly\" middle name, Leslie; etc.).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Peril and chases, plus sequences in which Tim's imagination conjures up everything from attacking animals (gorilla, shark, etc.) to spooky hallways and looming, evil figures. Tim goes up against a gang of babies; Nerf-like dart guns are fired, a baby is hurled through a window, a beloved stuffed animal is threatened (and ultimately beheaded). The brothers investigate a dark, creepy room, get captured, and are then \"looked after\" by a thug dressed up as a nanny, who ends up pursuing them during an epic chase. Tim's parents are in danger. Arguments, primarily between Tim and Boss Baby (they also slap/hit each other a few times); Tim sometimes feels ignored and unloved by his parents.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Bare baby bottoms seen a few times; a dog sniffs Boss Baby's bottom when he's in his puppy costume. The boys hitch a ride with the ladies in a bachelorette party, who wear fairly skimpy dresses.\n|Language|: Infrequent potty language (\"fart,\" \"poop,\" \"doody,\" \"toot\"), plus \"freaky,\" \"suck it,\" \"heck,\" and insults like \"brat,\" \"muscle head,\" \"you went to community college,\" and \"big fat baby\" (though that's also a coveted title at BabyCorp.). A fake breakfast cereal is called \"Cluster Puft.\" Humor related to sneezing, throwing up, etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: No real products in the movie, but there are merchandising tie-ins in real life.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne is served in first class when the boys fly to Las Vegas.

Adult brothers Tim (now voiced by James Marsden) and Ted Templeton (still Alec Baldwin) are once again lured into a Baby Corp. mission and must work through their differences to defeat a dangerous new villain. The series continues to emphasize the value of family, teamwork, and communication. But, also as in the original, there are potentially frightening moments of peril/conflict, including chases, some destruction, mild bullying among kids at a competitive school, and fight scenes between babies (some of whom are, questionably, dressed as ninjas). The plot also includes a disturbing case of mass hypnotism and mind control. There's a bit of potty and crying-baby humor, as well as a fixation on one character's obsession with sweets/sugar. Characters occasionally use words like \"butt,\" \"sucks,\" \"heck,\" and \"what the frittata.\" In one brief moment, a pair of kids accidentally see/show their baby genitals (off camera) and scream in comical horror. Several lines are clearly aimed at adults, since they include references to movies like Gladiator, Shawshank Redemption, Terminator, Lord of the Rings, etc.\n|Educational Value|: For entertainment, not educational purposes, though there are lessons about teamwork and family. Young viewers might also pick up on some of the engineering or other STEM-related questions and answers in the classroom.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes strong family bonds and showing up for those you love, whether it's for holidays and milestones or just family dinners. Although sibling rivalry and jealousy are depicted, the story emphasizes the need to overcome sibling antagonism and remember that siblings and families should protect one another, work as a team, and listen before jumping to conclusions. Stresses the importance of parents, rules, and structure in babies and children's lives, though also makes the point that pushing kids hard to succeed at a young age isn't a great idea/healthy for them. On the downside, a joke references needing to \"lose this baby fat,\" and one character refers to two young boys as \"ladies\" when they're dressed in her clothes out of necessity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tim is a loving husband and father and a proud older brother who's impressed by his younger brother's accomplishments. Ted is a quick thinker, a persuasive leader, and ultimately an attentive and caring uncle. Tabitha is brilliant but a little insecure. Tina is wise beyond her years and knows how to observe and help with a mission; she also has her priorities in order. The Templeton family and most of the supporting characters are White; some of the babies are portrayed very simplistically as creepy/not \"normal.\" The portrayal of the Baby Ninjas could be considered insensitive, since ninjas are from Japanese culture, and the babies are not.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Baby Ninjas are fully costumed as such and threaten/chase the main characters with weapons (swords) in tow. Several chase scenes in which the villain uses a mechanical body and immobilizes first the Templeton brothers and then fights with children. Another wild chase/pursuit leads to some destruction and an explosion in town. The brothers fight each other, including grabbing each other's chests and twisting. One young child at the academy is creepy and made to look a bit like Pennywise from It; she's shown with a balloon and a spotlight and keeps saying \"I like ___\" with a scary face and then starts smothering someone. Precious the pony hates Tim and is often huffing in his face or hurting him in some way -- even kicking him. Parents are hypnotized and controlled by the villain. Arguments/disagreements. Mild bullying at school; a boy says he wants to see Tabitha fail and calls her a nerd, and others make fun of Tim for not knowing the answer to questions.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nonsexual near-nudity as newly transformed Tim and Ted see and accidentally show their baby genitals (not on camera, but it's implied) and start screaming/covering up.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"sucks,\" \"butt,\" \"dum dum,\" \"stupid,\" \"nerd,\" and the stand-in phrase \"what the frittata.\" Ted yells \"unleash heck\" to the babies as a command. Some potty and crying baby humor. When someone defeats the Baby Ninjas, they yell \"Sayonara Baby!\" which is a Terminator reference/joke but could be construed as insensitive since ninjas are from Japanese culture (and the babies are not).\n|Products & Purchases|: Mentos play a pivotal role in one scene. Hot Wheels logo on a shirt; scene from DreamWorks' Spirit show/movie. Also plenty of merchandise tie-ins off screen: apparel, toys, games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: While it's not technically a drug, there's an exorbitant amount of sugar/candy consumption in the movie, particularly by Dr. Erwin Armstrong.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f35024441b1001fa0d9da": {"verified": false, "updated": "2022-07-28"}, "plex://movie/5d776855e6d55c0020410ef3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-bounty-hunter", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this uninspired romantic comedy with an action twist is a little more violent than most films of this genre. It has gunfights and knee-whackings, but no outright gore. There's a fair amount of swearing, including \"ass\" and \"s--t,\" and an improbable reunion between a career woman and the ex-husband who can't seem to stop making fun of her, which sends some mixed messages about love and relationships. A scene set in a strip club includes some barely clad women (thongs, bras/pasties); there are plenty of references to sex as well.\n|Positive Messages|: Aniston\u2019s character is supposedly independent and successful, and yet she\u2019s still painted as someone who\u2019s fragile and incomplete unless she\u2019s with a guy. And not just any guy, but one who -- what else? -- needs redeeming. Buried amid the rubble of unfunny jokes is an interesting, but hardly surprising message about how relationships crumble because of two people\u2019s shortcomings, not usually one.\n|Positive Role Models|: Milo and Nicole are supposed rough-and-tumble characters, and certainly nice enough, but he\u2019s a caricature and she\u2019s a contradiction. Though meant to portray a smart, sassy reporter, Nicole spends nearly the entire movie in impractical high heels and cleavage-baring tank top.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Loan sharks whack a guy\u2019s leg with a golf club. Two men have a fistfight at a parade. A formerly-married couple bicker; she throws things at him, he insults her. Guns are drawn and fired; two characters are injured. A street chase results in an SUV careening off the road and rolling over. A guy is Tasered.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple banters flirtatiously. There\u2019s talk of \u201cgetting laid\" and many other references to sex. A seduction attempt includes someone being straddled. Very scantily clad (thongs, bras/pasties) women dance in a strip bar.

Several scenes are packed with tension as the main characters evade police or other threats. Some angry confrontations turn violent. In one scene a character uses a dead body as a shield and a cushion for a long fall. The main characters embrace and kiss passionately in one scene without wearing shirts, though no nudity is shown. Language is strong, but not constant and includes \"f--k,\" \"bulls--t,\" and \"Goddamn.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Definitely some mixed messages here. On the one hand, the film shows government as corrupt and manipulative and the main character battles against it in order to be a good man and live a free life. On the other hand, the extraordinary fighting scenes are what makes this movie so watchable, so while the ideals of righteousness and purity are celebrated, so is violence.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bourne is a tricky role model. As a reborn man, he sheds his past identity and whatever bad things he did along with it. His new self is a good, honest, caring man who happens to be an exceptionally good fighter. He puts himself on the line to protect good people, and defends himself against the bad -- to the point of death. If he lies or manipulates, it's only to serve good. But he still kills people...\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many fighting scenes, mostly hand-to-hand combat, but also with guns and knives. Some blood but no gore, other than a close-up shot of bullets being removed from a body. Several characters are murdered assassination-style, one jumps out of a window to his death. Several tense scenes, including two where children are potentially at risk of violence.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One very intimate scene that turns into passionate kissing. Shirts come off, though no nudity, and then the camera pulls away.\n|Language|: Strong language throughout, but not constant. A couple uses of \"f--k,\" and \"s--t,\" and a bit more of \"hell,\" \"Goddamn,\" and \"for Christ's sake.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Definite product placement of a Mini that includes some very fancy driving and a brief close-up of the brand name on the steering wheel.

(This is the first in the series not to star Matt Damon, though his character is mentioned several times.) This time, Jeremy Renner stars as a genetically modified agent who must flee for his life. Like the earlier Bourne movies, Legacy is a big-budget, fast-paced, smart action thriller with near non-stop action -- including explosions, motorcycle chases, and many, many fight scenes, some of which get quite brutal (necks snapped, faces smashed, etc.). There's also some swearing (including \"s--t\") and social drinking, but the constant action violence is the main issue here.\n|Positive Messages|: The government is depicted as a manipulative organization that will toss people aside when they're no longer necessary.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aaron Cross is trying to serve his country, but he soon learns that his country has no more need of his services and is trying to dispose of him. He makes references to being sent on missions that were morally indefensible but necessary, but none of that happens during the movie. He does demonstrate some compassion by protecting Stephanie and civilian characters, and Stephanie herself is a smart, capable female lead character. Cross' bosses don't even try to justify their efforts to hide their black-ops mess by killing anyone who knows too much, though they cloak their actions behind the veil of trying to do what's \"necessary\" to protect democracy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Near non-stop action as Cross tries to escape a manhunt on two continents. Chases on foot and motorcycle, including some intense crashes and explosions, and plenty of fight scenes. Cross takes out his opponents with handguns, rifles, and often his fists, and some scenes include unpleasant images as he brutalizes people with his bare hands. Necks are snapped, and faces are bashed in.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's no time for romance in The Bourne Legacy; it's all action, all the time.\n|Language|: Occasional swearing, including \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The characters board an American Airlines flight at one point.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking by adults within a social context.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682b8718ba001e31281d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-bourne-supremacy", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Bourne Supremacy, the second entry in the Matt Damon Bourne trilogy is filled with the same intense, dark, life-and-death struggles as the others. Gunfire, explosions, tense chases, bloody fights, narrow escapes, and disturbing flashbacks contribute to the steady suspense and action. Its fast pace and pulsing music keep the viewer on edge from beginning to end. The filmmakers keep the emotional stakes high as well, so there are some profoundly sad moments. There is occasional, mostly mild, cursing, and a brief scene shows a partially clothed pole dancer in a club.\n|Positive Messages|: Good ultimately triumphs over evil, but not necessarily before leaving tragedy in its wake. Despite the enormity of sorrow and anger generated by his enemies, the hero's actions prove that a human being can stay true to his values even in the worst circumstances.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jason Bourne has set very high standards for himself, so in spite of the violence inherent in his pursuit of the villains, he is honorable, fair, and in control. He's an admirable action hero: clever, courageous, moral, and unwavering in his quest for justice. Some members of government agencies (both U.S. and foreign) are portrayed as corrupt and ruthless; others are models of public service: devoted to duty, honesty, and fairness.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The frequent hard-edged action results in multiple deaths: by gunfire, drowning, strangling, explosion, and savage hand-to-hand combat. The bloody aftermath of several of the deaths is clearly visible and disturbing. Likable characters are repeatedly at risk throughout, narrowly escaping assault rifles, knives, bombs, and deadly extended car chases/crashes. There's one suicide.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One revealing bikini top is seen, along with one brief shot of a pole dancer.\n|Language|: Scattered swearing and harsh language: \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"for Christ's sake,\" son-of-a-bitch,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and one use of \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Westin Hotels, Bosch, Lays Potato Chips, and lots of Russian and German signage for shops, products, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Alcoholic beverages are consumed in a few scenes: one in which the hero pretends to be drunk; another in which a character takes a strong drink just before he kills himself.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682beb5d26001f1de904": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-bourne-ultimatum", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Bourne Ultimatum features wall-to-wall action, much of it violent, causing repeated, bloody injuries to Bourne. The film includes car chases and crashes, explosions, fights, falls from great heights, smashes through windows, and murders (hand-to-hand, by gunfire), as well as images of dead bodies. The plot involves high tech surveillance and a dastardly, secret CIA program, and the hero comes to distrust his (U.S.) government (that said, Senate hearings at film's end lead to arrests of \"rogue agents\"). Language includes \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Mixed messages. Government is portrayed as corrupt and manipulative, and the main character battles against it in order to live a free life. On the other hand, the fight scenes are what makes the Bourne movies so watchable, so while the ideals of righteousness and purity are celebrated, so is violence.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bourne is singularly moral-minded, though he hasn't always been that way; CIA agents and other killers are deadly, calculating, and cold.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Bourne first appears limping and being chased aboard a moving train; he jumps off, finds a hospital, trails blood everywhere, washes his bloody hands, self-injects a needle full of painkiller, hits one officer and holds his gun on another. Flashbacks throughout show young Bourne's torture (hooded figures, waterboarding, frantic camerawork and dissolves), refer to his girlfriend's murder (\"shot in the head\"). Scene in morgue shows corpse. Violent acts -- shown in chaotic camerawork and editing -- include explosions (preceded by bomb-making), punching, kicking, flipping, leaping, falling, crashing through a window, car-crashing and -screeching, shooting (by snipers and face-to-face), bone-breaking, stabbing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In subjective flashbacks, Bourne tenderly kisses Maria (his dead girlfriend), once underwater, as she floats away.\n|Language|: Several uses of \"s--t\" and \"damn,\" repeated uses of \"hell\" in frustration (e.g., \"What the hell's going on here?\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Vespa motorbike.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In flashbacks, Bourne and another man appear to be sedated.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770dd96b655001fea040e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/a-boy-called-christmas", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that A Boy Called Christmas is a warm, festive family adventure with moments of peril that could frighten younger viewers, as well as parental death. Based on Matt Haig's popular kids' book, this Father Christmas origin story centers on a young boy named Nikolas (Henry Lawfull) who sets off on a quest to find his father. It boasts strong role models and positive messages often associated with the holiday season, including the importance of helping those less fortunate and how the thought counts more than the gifts themselves. Characters are chased by animals, threatened, and attacked by a troll. But no real harm comes to anyone -- other than the troll, whose head explodes off-screen. The settings are very festive, with plenty of Christmas decorations, elf cities, and snow, plus an adorable talking mouse (voiced by Stephen Merchant) who's sure to melt most hearts. The film has plenty of Christmas spirit and overall is a gentle watch that can be enjoyed by most age groups, from kids to grandparents.\n|Educational Value|: The film is intended to entertain rather than educate, but it does have some strong positive messages.\n|Positive Messages|: Teaches the importance of hope, and that just because you can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Home is not a place, it's a feeling. Gifts themselves don't matter, it's the thought behind them that counts. Difference should not be feared, and we should help those in need if we can. Sometimes the truth is painful, but it can make us stronger.\n|Positive Role Models|: Nikolas is not interested in money and possessions. He is content with what he has because he believes that having each other is more important. He is polite, respectful, and caring, as well as showing resourcefulness, determination, and bravery -- even if his desire to help others sometimes puts him in danger. His father, Joel, is kind and responsible. Although he begins the film holding money and belongings in high regard, he comes to learn through his son that being good is better than being rich. The kids in the \"real-world\" framing device are initially a little cheeky, calling their aunt \"old,\" but grow to show her more respect and kindness.\n|Diverse Representations|: Some diversity within the cast, with a Black family as the central characters in in the \"real-world\" framing device, and a South Asian family and a Black teacher within the elf world. However, none of these characters are given huge parts and are surrounded by mostly White characters. Both male and female characters are represented as strong-willed and capable, with some women in positions of power in the elf world, though it is men who go on an expedition in hunting gear, which plays to stereotype. All characters are able-bodied and of a similarly slim body type, and there is no diversity from an LGBTQ+ perspective.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Passing mention of nightmares, and frequent reference to the death of parents in the past, as well as a scene involving the death of a parent in the story. Characters are chased by a reindeer and a roaring bear, and there is reference to a bear eating a human. A reindeer is shot with an arrow, a mouse chased with an axe, and mention made of a frozen dead squirrel. A troll attacks and picks up a character. In a counter-attack, the troll's head explodes (though off-screen). Characters are caught in traps and cages, tied up, threatened with spears, held high up in the air, and fall from great heights. There is a large explosion, though nobody is seen hurt.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Initially some characters put great importance on wealth and gifts.

Several intense sequences involve a large angry bear that attacks the main characters -- which are even more so when seen in 3-D -- and (possible spoiler alert) a possibly disturbing but mostly comical transformation of a mother into a bear. A moment when the mom-turned-bear temporarily forgets she's human and growls at her daughter could upset younger kids. There's also a lot of brawling among the Scotsmen, who use both weapons (arrows, swords, etc.) and their bodies (fists, teeth) on each other. The first Pixar movie to revolve around a female main character, Brave does have a strong message about family relationships and open communication between parents and kids (particularly mothers and daughters). There's no romance for Princess Merida, but you can expect a few jokes about men being naked under their kilts; a couple of scenes even include quick glimpses of naked cartoon bums belonging to men and three young boys. Although there are no product placements in the movie, there's a ton of Brave merchandise available, particularly aimed at girls.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will pick up some stuff about Scotland: the culture, the clans, the ancient dress, the idea that noble girls were often forced to marry out of obligation and alliance rather than love. They will also learn a bit about Scottish lore regarding the druid witch and will o' the wisps.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include communication, courage, and self-control. The movie focuses on how an at-odds mother and daughter can mend their relationship and learn from each other. A mother is fierce when it comes to defending her daughter, and vice versa. The way that Merida and Elinor work together is a beautiful tribute to the bond between mother and child. The movie also teaches the idea that \"legends are lessons\" -- stories that can teach us all about follies like pride, greed, and selfishness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Merida is strong-willed, stubborn, and smart: She wants to find her own way in the world, not be tied to a suitor for betrothal before she's ready for marriage. While she's independent and brave, she does make a misguided decision about how to deal with her disagreement with her mother. Elinor has many of the same qualities she has trouble dealing with in her daughter. She's a kind, intelligent queen with a strong sense of duty and how she must comport herself. During their shared ordeal, both mother and daughter learn to think more like the other, and, as a result, they each change for the better. Many of the supporting characters -- especially the clan chiefs and their warriors -- are broadly caricatured for the sake of humor; they brawl constantly, make rude noises, etc.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are several intense/scary scenes in Brave revolving around a giant, frightening bear; some of them may be too much for younger or more sensitive kids. The bear attacks King Fergus in the opening sequence (viewers learn that it tore off his leg; he has a wooden stump), and later it rages against Merida, Elinor, and the entire congregation of Scottish clansmen. Possible spoiler alert: Elinor's transformation into a bear is mostly funny, but in one scene that could upset younger kids, she becomes more bear than mother and growls menacingly at Merida. Young kids might also be frightened when the men (including Fergus) take arms against bear-Elinor and are set on killing her. The climactic battle between the bears and the clan gets very tense, especially when it looks like Merida or Elinor will be hurt. Some of the scenes with the witch may also be scary for kids -- she's mostly harmless, but her hut is spooky, and she comes off as creepy herself. The will o' the wisps are eerie and a bit ominous. The Scotsmen fight constantly, using both their bodies (hands, fists, teeth, feet) and weapons (swords, arrows, etc.) on their opponents.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Fergus and Elinor are an affectionate married couple; he smacks her on the bum, and, later, when she's naked under a sheet (nothing is seen below her neck), he stares at her until she reminds him that others are around, too. The men are naked under their kilts, and in a couple of scenes, animated naked rear ends (both of adult men and young boys) are briefly glimpsed. A housemaid has ample cleavage.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Although there are no product placements in the actual film, Brave already has much merchandise available: dolls, costumes, apps, storybooks, a soundtrack, video games, apparel, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The Scotsmen gather in the castle for a feast before it devolves into a brawl, and there are steins of drink, presumably some sort of mead or ale, but it's not referenced, and no one is represented as drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768446f4521001ea9f179": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-brave-little-toaster", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this is the rare instance of a non-pet or child-based animated film. Appliances that are imbued with likable personalities and voices struggle with feelings of abandonment and obsolescence, and decide to set out into the city to find their master, the young boy who used to visit the summer cottage where they've been left.

When the newborn baby arrives, a character asks where babies come from, which could inspire questioning that some parents might not be ready to answer. The appliances encounter an army of angry appliances that have built a missile to destroy Earth. The look of this movie is virtually the same as the original Brave Little Toaster, but the story is a bit more childish. Its true target audience is preschoolers -- they'll enjoy the cute talking appliance characters the most. Grade-school kids may be attracted by the sci-fi/adventure elements, while older kids and tweens probably won't be interested.\n|Educational Value|: Though intended to entertain, there's some discussion of the Viking One spacecraft and its exploration of Mars. The concept of \"planned obsolescence\" is briefly mentioned in discussion of appliances that were deliberately designed not to last.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, cooperation, and humility are revealed through characters' actions.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Brave Little Toaster displays heroism and self-sacrifice when he rescues his friends from danger.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The appliances encounter an army of angry appliances that have built a missile to destroy Earth.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Upon the arrival of a newborn baby, one of the characters asks, \"Where do babies come from?\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776845f59e58002189a932": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-brave-little-toaster-to-the-rescue", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sequel to The Brave Little Toaster has a little bit of peril driving the main plot, which involves a slew of animals being sold off for testing at an evil laboratory. There is some discussion of abusive treatment of a monkey, but it's never elaborated on in graphic detail, or shown. While a bit dated, the movie offers great messages about friendship, integrity, and valuing things for their worth.\n|Educational Value|: Kids get some explanation of how computers share and store information, including viruses.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages include working together, trying not to complain, the importance of friendship, and the notion that just being smart isn't all that admirable if you aren't also a kind person, too. It also emphasizes the way things are valued for their newness and quickly discarded when they're old, even when they are still useful.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though there are some stock characters here -- the forgetful boyfriend, the neglected girlfriend -- the appliances and computers, while fairly one-dimensional, are memorable characters who are on a mission to help a friend.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's some very mild slapstick involving the appliances breaking, falling, or dodging harm.

This movie has high levels of blood and gore (animal and human), vulgarity, and sexual elements. In battle, characters fight and die with swords, spears, spikes, swords, and molten lead. Rape is used as a method of oppression by the British. Sex scenes between Wallace and his doomed wife and with a consenting princess. There's some nudity in the form of female breasts and male backsides. Expect torture, hackings, stabbings, throat-slitting, and arrows and spears dealing horrible death and injuries. William Wallace is brave and noble but vengeful and absolutely uncompromising. Occasional profanity, including \"f--k.\"  There are sexual innuendos concerning prowess and the size of genitalia.\n|Positive Messages|: Freedom is championed as something necessary to happiness and contentment in life, and is worth dying for. The barbarity of war is shown to be the only solution to the greedy and oppressive policies of the British towards the Scottish.\n|Positive Role Models|: William Wallace emerges as the uncompromising leader of the rebellion in Scotland against the British. He fervently believes in freedom, and is willing to give up his life for it. A legend grows around him, and he becomes the symbol of the rebellion.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Torture, hackings, stabbings, throat-slitting, arrows and spears, and rocks deal horrible death and injuries, though quick editing rarely lingers on the gore.

Even though viewers can feel secure about the positive outcome, the peril is palpable for most of the film -- especially during a sequence in which three teens fall through thin ice into frigid water -- and may be too intense for young kids. (Heck, it could be too intense for many parents: A box of tissues is recommended.) The boy, who was adopted as a baby, struggles with feelings of rejection and identity; he continually describes himself as \"unwanted,\" which could be triggering for families touched by adoption. The main characters are good people who are quite human, trying their best, persevering, learning, and evolving; they also learn and express gratitude and humility. With its faith-based message, the movie is most directly targeted at devout viewers, but given that the events really happened, the film's take on the power of prayer may leave some skeptics thinking twice. Executive-produced by NBA star Stephen Curry, the movie stars Chrissy Metz and Topher Grace.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie is about the power of prayer and love. Parents' love is fierce and unconditional; everyone needs support. Written and verbal message: \"Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.\" Gratitude, humility, and perseverance are clear themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: When a family goes through difficult times, entire community shows up in support. A family that receives a miracle shows gratitude, learns humility. Joyce is a fiercely protective mother who fights for her son in all instances; sometimes that means she forgets to be kind, but she tries to correct that behavior through love, hard work. Diversity throughout (based on real-life people).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Not so much \"violent\" as \"sad and upsetting\": Three teens abruptly fall through thin ice, and one's life is in jeopardy throughout most of film. Scenes of the boys in and under the water are extremely tense. Other scenes show scared, sad, crying people. Some arguing/yelling. Minor bullying, including one instance of shoving in sports.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Boys describe girls as \"hot.\" Teens have crushes. Hugging.\n|Language|: Ethnic slur during bullying incident. \"Hell\" is used as an exclamation twice.

The main characters are fairly two dimensional, and they seem much more caught up in having the perfect wedding than in having a strong marriage. That said, the language is mild (\"ass\" and the like), and the sexuality is on the milder side (kisses, a brief glimpse at a bra and panties as a character changes) -- though a bachelorette party scene includes shirtless male strippers. There is a notable amount of drinking (tequila shots, especially), and prominently featured brands include the Plaza Hotel, Apple, Tiffany, and Vera Wang.\n|Positive Messages|: Best friends seem more interested in their wedding days than in their actual marriages, and they let wedding planning get in the way of their friendship.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main characters are fairly two-dimensional and definitely play up gender stereotypes related to shopping and consumerism.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A quick pushing and shoving fight between the two brides.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of scenes of the actresses in hot pants or bras.

Produced by Judd Apatow, Bridesmaids has all the hallmarks of an Apatow vehicle, including risque humor (there's no nudity, but expect plenty of sex talk and a couple scenes with moaning and groaning), over-the-top scatological comedy (the consequences of some unintentional food poisoning are beyond raunchy), zany adventures, crude language (including \"f--k\" and \"c--t\"), immature behavior (some of which is fueled by drinking) ... and surprising insight into friendships and adult relationships. It's not age appropriate for tweens and young teens, but it's definitely worth viewing for older moviegoers interested in a fresh spin on the \"chick flick\" formula.\n|Positive Messages|: The road to the movie's \"lesson\" is hilarious and often raunchy, but the message is earnest: Good friendships don't come often, so cherish them. And also this: Your life is what you make of it. So if you're down, get on your feet.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though they lose sight of what's important for a bit, Annie and Lillian ultimately have each other's backs. For most of the movie, Annie is very hard on herself and lets life get her down, but she finds her way back to a positive attitude -- which is very relatable journey. Megan is a strong, can-do woman with a great attitude; she's crude, but she's also the most self-confident character of the bunch. There's some cattiness among the women, but much of it is ultimately addressed maturely. The two main male characters are polar opposites; one is a shallow, callous jerk (and is clearly intended to be seen that way), while the other is sweet and supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman goes berserk at a bridal shower and attacks the decorations and the cake and upends tables. A medicated airplane passenger causes a commotion that drives a federal marshal to action. Some discussion about where to stash a gun.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The movie opens with an energetic, often loud sex scene; no sensitive body parts are shown, but nudity is implied (you can see down the whole side of the man's body at one point), and the woman is wearing a bra and underwear. Lots of moaning and groaning. A man squeezes a woman's breast through her bra and talks about having \"f--k buddies.\" A couple is shown making out and trying to rip each other's clothes off; later, she wakes up in bed covered by a sheet (nudity is implied). Another character propositions strangers, sometimes crudely. A woman takes off her top to get a man's attention (shoulders shown, but not breasts). Plenty of sexual innuendo/talk; a woman does an impression of a penis.\n|Language|: Strong, frequent language includes \"f--k\" (and many permutations of it), \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"c--k,\" \"c--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" \"damn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"hell,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some glimpses of labels, but the bigger issue here is the commercialization of weddings and the \"bigger is better\" ethos that has pervaded the whole engagement-to-nuptials journey.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of champagne- and wine-swilling at events, sometimes to excess.

The story includes mature themes about loneliness, platonic love, parental affection, family relationships, religious/class differences, and even death. For example, a financially troubled father is emotionally distant from his son, while the mother seems too overwhelmed with five kids to connect to any of them. At school, kids are ridiculed because of their appearance, and a bully and her associates routinely terrorize younger kids. Potential spoiler alert: Due to a central character's death, sensitive children (or those who've experienced the loss of a loved one) may need to be comforted after the film.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn important lessons about friendship and imagination.\n|Positive Messages|: Through an incredible friendship, a child learns that if you open your mind and heart, you can unlock the magic and the beauty in every person and situation. Strong messages about individuality. There are also serious themes relating to loneliness and even death, but they're treated thoughtfully.\n|Positive Role Models|: Leslie is a strong, creative, independent role model for tween girls. Jess is less sure of himself but undergoes some profound changes over the course of the movie.

Winnie sleeps with Britney's boyfriend because she's jealous, and Britney has a hard time adjusting to a new school. There's some profanity and rude finger gestures, as well as some race-baiting (Winnie calls the Crenshaw Heights squad \"ghetto\" -- but by then she's well-established as the Mean Girl of the movie). The characters learn to be honest and trust those who are trustworthy, although this lesson may be overshadowed by the bad behavior leading up to this point.

There is some mild sexual innuendo, and some naming of body parts (tetas) in Spanish. Most of the sexual messages are served up along racial and class stereotypes: The East L.A. teens are sultry, street-wise vixens, while the squeaky-clean Malibu kids are either earnest naifs or elitist snobs. But there's nothing overtly offensive, and movie's central messages of friendship, loyalty, and dedication make it a palatable, if not original, diversion.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie shows that groups from very different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds can band together for a common cause, as Lina combines her East L.A. cheer team with the Malibu Vista high school squad. Together they demonstrate that hard work and perseverance do pay off. Also, friendship and loyalty play a large role in the movie\u2019s successes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though Lina can be hotheaded and impulsive, she is a hard worker and a kind, dedicated friend. Her friendships with her \u201ccheer sisters,\u201d as well as with her new stepsister Skyler, are caring and supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of posturing and verbal abuse, but no actual fighting; one girl pushes another with her shoulder, pointing out, \u201cI didn\u2019t use my hands!\u201d\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There\u2019s some kissing, and sexual innuendo abounds, but there\u2019s nothing explicit; one character, discussing his love for his car, says \u201cAt least she lets me get under the hood.\u201d Spanish is used for some body parts: Lina suggests that her new stepdad was attracted to her mom\u2019s tetas.

There's also some cheer-related violence, including falls and broken bones. More problematically, most of the characters are stereotypes -- the \"ghetto\" African-American girl, the dumb blond, the effeminate male cheerleader, etc. Though these labels are disproven later in the film, viewers would be better served watching something that doesn't resort to stereotypes in the first place.\n|Positive Messages|: Social stereotypes run rampant through the first part of the film, including the \"ghetto\" African-American girl, the effeminate gay man, and the dumb blond. They're disproven later, but they're in full effect through most of the film. Penn lies to his father about where he's going and the teams lie, cheat, and steal in order to win.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A lot of cheer-related injuries, including teens falling and breaking limbs or hitting their heads (nothing graphic and no serious injuries).

The movie maintains an uplifting tone despite many uncomfortable scenes in which people treat each other badly. Characters change slowly over the course of the movie and learn how to be kinder to others and to themselves, but before they get there, they demonstrate some iffy behavior. Brittany and her friend/roommate use substances irresponsibly: they take unnamed prescription pills, use something in a vape pen, and binge drink. Brittany also smokes pot (marijuana is decriminalized in New York, where the movie is set). Sexual content includes a scene in which a man asks for (and, the movie implies, receives) oral sex from Brittany at a dance club and another in which characters who've gotten to know and respect each other have what looks to be mutually pleasurable sex with moaning and movements (no nudity). Several uncomfortable scenes involve fat-shaming, though the movie depicts this practice as wrong; the movie can also be seen as supporting the idea that \"real\" runners are slim/lean. Language is frequent but generally used in the context of humor: \"f--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" \"bulls--t,\" etc. A diverse cast inhabits relatable characters, who make mistakes but then try (and succeed!) at doing better. Themes include courage, perserverance, and self-control.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong themes of courage, perseverance, and self-control are demonstrated in the way Brittany begins running and eventually improves to the point in which she enters a marathon. She improves realistically -- slowly, with great effort, and over a period of time. Though the movie clearly depicts fat-shaming as wrong, there's some insulting language directed at people with larger body types (one woman is called a \"fat girl\" dismissively, and another is told that her husband can't possibly love her at her size, etc.), and the storyline does buy into the idea that a healthy athlete is a slimmer one.\n|Positive Role Models|: Brittany is a realistically flawed person who doesn't always make the \"right\" choices but changes her situation through grit and determination and transforms her personal relationships through greater empathy and caring. All of the characters are kind-hearted and relatable -- they sometimes make mistakes, but they own up to them and try to atone. Characters change and grow over the course of the movie. The cast is diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, and body type.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some cruel/insulting words.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Characters have sex in bed with moaning and thrusting; no nudity, but in one scene a man fiddles with a condom before returning to bed and having sex under the covers. A woman cries after sex and receives realistic reassurance that her partner cares about her feelings. A man asks a woman to go to the bathroom with him at a club and hands her napkins to cushion her knees, implying that he expects oral sex.\n|Language|: Frequent use of words including \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"bulls--t,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"Jesus Christ\" (as an exclamation). Expect words for body parts, too: \"t-ts,\" \"boner,\" \"c--k,\" \"d--k.\" Some insulting language directed at people with larger body types.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many scenes depict binge drinking/drinking to excess, clearly intended to suggest unhappy/frayed lives. Brittany gulps down liquor at a club, takes unnamed prescription pills (then throws up in a toilet), and vapes something.

In spite of these loftier themes, it's still a Jim Carrey comedy, with hammy physical humor, profanity, and sexual humor and content. For example, given God-like power, Carrey's Bruce immediately uses the power to make a woman's dress rise up on the street, then has a monkey come out of the rear end of one of the thugs who had previously beaten him up. A recurring joke in the movie concerns Bruce's dog and his inability to be properly house-trained; as \"God,\" Bruce has his dog use the toilet. All in all, Carrey's humor is a bizarre, incongruous pairing with deeper themes of spirituality.\n|Positive Messages|: Bruce learns to not blame fate or God for everything that goes wrong with his life and his career, and that his actions, no matter how well-intended, have consequences. The positive messages are undermined by a turnaround that doesn't feel entirely sincere.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bruce begins the movie as a jealous, spiteful, petty person, who, when he receives great powers, uses them to humiliate his rival and peek up women's skirts. Ultimately, he learns to accept his current position in life, and grows to find contentment by making the best of his situation.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character gets beat up by thugs after trying to defend a homeless man.

Scowling, threatening grasshoppers loom over and swarm toward a colony of vulnerable ants, the heroes of the story. The insects contend with fire, rain, predatory birds, as well as the power hungry grasshoppers. Older kids will enjoy the clever humor and the unique view of the insect world, as well as the interspecies conflicts.\n|Educational Value|: A very elementary look at insects: each species has a purpose and a place in the circle of life. In this film, individual bugs are given personality, identity and purpose, which may help engender kids\u2019 respect for nature.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, communication, resourcefulness, and courage can defeat a seemingly stronger enemy. Solutions to great problems can come from unlikely sources. It\u2019s important to believe in yourself and have faith in your abilities. Nature has a certain order which is to be respected: \"The sun grows the food; ants pick the food; grasshoppers eat the food; birds eat the grasshoppers.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Family relationships are important and special even in the insect world. Mothers provide for and protect their offspring. Flick, the hero ant, is smart, caring, loyal, and so brave that he\u2019s willing to sacrifice all for the sake of his colony. At first he faces ridicule and self-doubt, but ultimately he saves the day, and everyone learns to value and respect him. Other species rise above their fear and join the team in order to survive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In cartoon terms, there are scary, intimidating bugs and birds, as well as some jeopardy to the film\u2019s heroes involving fire, rain, falls, and capture. A troop of grasshoppers led by the fierce Hopper threatens the ant queen\u2019s life, bullies the ant colony, swarms menacingly several times, and captures key ant players.

This tween-friendly adventure features slightly less violence, language, and sex (the romance is downplayed and positively chaste) than its predecessors. That said, there are still big fight scenes between Transformers and between Transformers and humans; weapons are used (one reduces humans to a clear goo), there's explosive destruction, and Bumblebee is tortured. Language includes a few uses of \"damn\" and \"s--t\"; refreshingly for the series, there are no crass or sexist jokes. Charlie is a surprisingly nuanced and courageous lead character, and the movie has clear themes of teamwork and friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, friendship, family bonds are all promoted. Charlie and Bumblebee befriend each other/bond, show that not all Transformers should be prejudged. Bumblebee's voice demonstrates power of music to communicate.\n|Positive Role Models|: Charlie is enterprising, intelligent, resourceful. She does hide Bumblebee's existence from her family, but she's patient, gives Bumblebee the benefit of the doubt, getting to know him, helping him. She and Memo are courageous, selfless, risking safety to rescue, support Bumblebee. Charlie's mother, stepfather, little brother are concerned, encouraging; when things get dangerous, they don't shy away from helping her. Villains are clearly delineated as bad guys.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Opening sequence shows Transformers' civil war on Cybertron: They use their weapons on one another, blasting, shooting. On Earth, soldiers (and civilians) see a ball of fire crash, with Transformers emerging. Soldiers fire on Bumblebee, who runs but doesn't retaliate -- unlike Decepticons, who start firing upon humans. Additional, similar scenes of Transformers fighting each other, humans. In one sequence, Bumblebee is tortured. Charlie and Memo are thrown about, hurt but not seriously injured. When Transformers kill humans with one particular weapon, it turns them into clear goo (happens a couple of times).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Charlie and Memo hold hands, kiss on the cheek; he's obviously interested in her. She asks him to take off his shirt for an experiment, not romance.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"freaking,\" \"shoot,\" \"shut up.\" Exclamations like \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera: Volkswagen, Sony, Atari, Camaro, BMW, Ford, Corvette, Scope, Fritos, Tab.

Strong language is not frequent, but one character says \"goddamn\" half a dozen times, and there are curse words such as \"p---y-whipped\" and \"s--t.\" A teen staying home alone has a party and drinks beer. Adults drink beer and smoke cigars.\n|Positive Messages|: Potential messages about being too quick to judge others or about taking a good look at yourself before accusing others are erased in the end when the truth about the mysterious neighbors is revealed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Carol Peterson models concern, using common sense, and tackling problems head-on. Ray, Art, and Rumsfield all model letting their imaginations run away with them and taking matters to the extreme. Teen neighbor Ricky is home alone, has a party, and is seen drinking beer.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A hopeful mention of finding someone's head cracked open. On a television, part of a slasher movie briefly shown; screaming and chainsaw sound effects are heard. Television also briefly shows what looks like the vomit scene from The Exorcist. A dream sequence shows a spooky satanic cult, a man with an ax in his head, and bloody clothing. A bloody hand is seen, with the \"blood\" later said to be paint.

Considering that most people have an innate fear of being buried alive, the movie can be nearly excruciating to watch -- although it's very well made. The main character (played by Ryan Reynolds) has a lighter, a cell phone, and some other supplies, but he's the only person shown on screen. Expect some intense behavior and strong language (including many uses of \"f--k\"). Brave older teens and grown-ups may be intrigued, but be ready for nightmares.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie seems to say that sometimes bad things happen to good people, and there's very little anyone can do about it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Paul never gives up trying to save his own life, and he spends his time thinking of his wife and child, even though he appears not to have led a squeaky-clean life. He learns to trust others and ask for help via the cell phone he has with him. He writes information down for future reference, and he's constantly solving problems. All of that said, the movie's outcome may obscure some of the character's finer points.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Paul is threatened by his unseen captors, and he shouts at various people on his cell phone. Viewers see grainy video images (on a cell phone) of another girl being tortured with a gun to her head. In another scene, Paul must chop off his finger to appease his tormenters, but nothing is shown.

The girl is punched, beaten, stripped to her bra, and briefly tortured. Her age isn't specifically mentioned in the movie, but actress Abigail Breslin is 16. There are also scenes in which characters are stabbed with a screwdriver and lit on fire. Other aspects of the movie are fairly mild, including language, with just a few uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" as well as some mild sexual innuendo involving teens (and one grown-up kiss). Several of the 911 calls heard on the soundtrack describe acts of violence, including drug use. Ultimately, because all of the movie's intense, serial killer-related violence centers around a teen victim, this movie isn't recommended for any but the most mature viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: A woman learns to face her fears, though she marches into a dangerous situation to do so. She also tries to forgive herself for a past mistake. On the downside, the movie promotes revenge.\n|Positive Role Models|: The movie takes a close look at the difficult work of 911 operators, who can be seen as heroic in a certain light. One such operator, the movie's main character, works tirelessly to save a teen girl's life.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A teenage girl is kidnapped, punched, beaten, stripped down to her bra, and briefly tortured. She's shown with a swollen eye. In an earlier scene, a prowler breaks into a home and attacks another teen girl. This girl is later shown dead (pixilated) on the evening news. A man is beaten with a shovel, stabbed with a screwdriver, and killed. A serial killer's gruesome hideout is shown, with bloody smears on the walls and a collection of girls' scalps. A man is lit on fire with gasoline and a lighter. Verbal descriptions of violent crimes and murders heard on the 911 calls.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A teen girl is shown in her bra, but it's not in a sexual/romantic context.

Starring Harrison Ford, it's a simpler, somewhat sanitized take on the book -- which makes it more appropriate for younger viewers -- but the themes and messages of London's story are still as crisp as a Yukon sunrise. Canine hero Buck and his friends are often in peril; the dogs escape it, but humans, not always. Buck suffers one significant hit from a human on-screen, and additional animal abuse is implied through taunts, the sound and verbal acknowledgement of a whip, and seeing dogs passed out, pushed beyond their limit. Ford's character, John Thornton, stands up to Buck's owner about this cruel treatment, and Buck stands up to his pack's alpha dog, Spitz, who also behaves with bullying behavior. There's an epic dog fight as a result, but both animals end up fine (the same unfortunately can't be said for a cute rabbit that's killed by a mean dog). The movie is set on the frontier, where the saloon is the center of the community. Alcohol flows, but drinking is negatively portrayed, and Buck actually teaches temperance. The theme of this story has always been that life is a two-sided coin: You'll encounter the good with the bad, the great with the terrible, moments of danger and moments of security. Life is unfair, but it's also what you make of it, with new beginnings and final endings. And through the eyes of a CGI dog set against gorgeous scenery, it's an exhilarating family experience with themes of courage, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Life is a journey: It will go in both unexpectedly wonderful and painfully unfair directions, but that's part of the necessary path to self-discovery. Allow yourself to grow out of the expectations that others put upon you. If you treat an animal well, it will treat you well. Themes include perseverance, courage, teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Buck clearly demonstrates courage, resilience, teamwork, perseverance. He stands up to those whose behavior he doesn't agree with, whether it's a bully, a tormenter, or an alcoholic. The Canadian letter carrier and his wife are upbeat, hardworking, supportive. A Native American plays a small but pivotal positive role.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent frontier violence/peril. Guns are used for threats and eventually escalate to a death. Physical fights between men, dogs, and men and dogs. A dog is hit with a club in one instance. Dogs are pushed to physical exhaustion, sometimes after a whip is used. A natural disaster threatens lives of human and animal. A dog is separated from his family after being abducted and is treated harshly. A fire erupts. For those who can connect the dots, it appears that some characters die in the elements due to foolish choices. A couple of animals are killed by other animals.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: One off-camera use of \"dammit.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Scenes take places in bars, and people drink alcohol.

Directed by Nia DaCosta and co-written and co-produced by Jordan Peele, the movie takes a progressive approach to themes raised in the original -- including the power of art and storytelling -- and it's both scary and thought-provoking. It has tons of blood and gore, with several killings. Expect to see stabbing, strangling, shooting, throat slashing, broken limbs, jump scares, a gross hand wound creeping up to the rest of the body, a child watching her father die via suicide (jumping from a high window), and more. There's kissing (both affectionate and passionate), cuddling, and interrupted foreplay; a man is shown without his shirt on. Language is very strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" the \"N\" word, and more. Adults drink socially and smoke pot.\n|Positive Messages|: It may take more than one viewing to grasp all themes raised, from gentrification to artistic appropriation, as well as concept of continuing to tell stories to keep discourse alive. Art (and movies) are extremely powerful, can be easily corrupted, the movie seems to be saying -- but keep \"telling everyone.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Some characters have achieved success, but no one is a clear role model. Most fall victim to supernatural events around them in one way or another.\n|Diverse Representations|: Positive representation of Black characters, showing both successes and trials. Characters are realistic and three-dimensional. Supporting cast includes a loving, mixed-race LGBTQ+ couple. A White art critic tries to tell Anthony's story and define his art through her own experiences, which is clearly meant to be problematic.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of blood and gore.

The movie stars Burt Reynolds and his sidekick Dom DeLuise on a cross-country auto race. Car stunts -- crashes, explosions, autos sailing through the air, high-speed chases -- provide the action. Exaggerated caricatures -- an Arab sheik, Japanese high-tech/martial-arts experts, a Jewish mother, a stutterer, good ol' boys, and plenty of curvy, dimwitted women and their barely covered breasts -- provide the humor. Profanity and slurs (i.e., \"schmuck,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hookers,\" \"s--t,\" \"gang-bang\"). Racial jokes are directed at an \"always-the-good-sport\" Sammy Davis Jr. In addition to the vehicle hijinks and sexual leering, drinking alcoholic beverages -- often to excess -- is a constant pastime for the crew. Beer is the drink of choice, and it's sometimes consumed even while the characters are at the wheels of their speeding vehicles.\n|Positive Messages|: Values friendship and camaraderie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Amid law-breaking, risky, irresponsible behavior, characters are high-spirited and loyal to their friends. Comic stereotypes: an Arab sheik, a Jewish mother, Southern \"rednecks,\" a bumbling government official, a stutterer, Japanese experts in technology, intellectually challenged women, and women who use sexual \"charms\" to distract men. Ethnically diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish action (without injuries or death) throughout. Car stunts: high-speed chases, explosions, crashes into structures, cars sailing in the air. Hand-to-hand fighting: a bar brawl, martial-arts combat, some slaps and knockdowns.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Every female, no matter how skilled, is included as \"eye candy.\" They wear skimpy clothing and plunging necklines and use their appealing bodies (especially breasts) to distract men and get what they want. Lead female is a beautiful airhead who simply (and literally) goes along for the ride. Men ogle; women flirt.\n|Language|: Swearing and coarse language: \"hell,\" \"dammit,\" \"rectum,\" \"pr--k,\" \"goddamn,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass.\" Sexual innuendo and insults: \"piece of tail,\" \"t-tty,\" \"hookers,\" \"getting laid,\" \"gangbang,\" \"putz,\" \"schmuck.\" Comic ethnic insults (for example, \"chocolate monk\"), generally using Sammy Davis Jr.'s and Jackie Chan's ethnicities as the butt of humor.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some featured, some incidental: Goodyear, Hawaiian Tropic, Nikon, Midas, GMC, Best Western, Budweiser, Ferrari, Dr Pepper, Subaru, Ruffles potato chips.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Frequent comic drinking and drunkenness: Beer is purchased, loaded into cars, and consumed with alacrity, even while characters are driving. Several characters get drunk; Dean Martin plays a longstanding inebriated character.

It focuses on the growing tension between Steve Rogers/Cap (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), which ultimately ramps up into an internal \"war\" between Avengers factions. It's about as violent as Winter Soldier: There's a lot of fighting, and it's all even more fraught because many of the big battle scenes are between Avengers. Although even young viewers might believe none of the main characters is going to die, characters do get injured (one so seriously he seems dead for a moment), and there's a lot of anguish as old friends find themselves on opposing sides. Language is infrequent but includes \"s--t\" and \"son of a bitch\"; romance is limited to a quick kiss and a few longing looks and tender moments.\n|Positive Messages|: Brings up issues of loyalty and friendship. Also explores the idea of personal will vs. the collective good and hones in on the fact that people who are wrong but think they're right can be the most dangerous kinds of adversaries. Focuses on the necessity of trust between teammates and how keeping something secret can be thought of as lying to someone. Characters demonstrate courage, integrity, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: While all the Avengers are brave, Steve/Captain America continues to be exceptionally loyal, principled, and decent. He isn't willing to obey a law if it means limiting his ability to help others. Vision sees what makes Scarlet Witch/Wanda wonderful, even though the outside world treats her as a danger. Black Panther is steadfast and strong, and he's mature enough to see how vengeance was eating at him. Tony means well but lets his ego get the better of him. Natasha and Clint are unconditional friends. Rhodey and Falcon are loyal to their best friends. The Avengers all feel guilty about the people who've died while they're battling forces of evil.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Avengers fight with outside forces and against one another. The fights usually involve their enhanced artifacts (like Cap's shield, Bucky's metal hand, and special suits), but the adversaries use weapons. A character grieves the death of a loved one. Explosions, guns, and enhanced weapons are used. Tons of explosions, collateral damage, and innocent casualties -- including a couple in more close-up than is typical for these films, which makes the impact more upsetting. An intense violent act from someone's past is revealed and shown.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Cap shares a quick kiss with a woman. Vision and Scarlet Witch exchange a couple of longing looks and embrace a couple of times.\n|Language|: A couple of uses of words including \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"hell, \"damn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"goddamn,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing overt in the movie, but there are many, many Avengers-related toys, action figures, games, apparel, and other products associated with all the characters in the franchise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a103a2d001f564ffb": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/captain-america-the-first-avenger", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Captain America: The First Avenger is a 1940s-set comic book-based superhero adventure that's full of explosive action violence. Expect tons of gun battles, fireballs, and fistfights (all of which are even more in-your-face in the 3-D version of the movie), as well as a scary-looking villain. In most other respects though, it's pretty tame as these kinds of movies go. Captain America is wholesome, compassionate, and brave; he doesn't have the dark side that many other superheroes do, and he's not a ladies' man or a party animal. There are a couple of tame kisses and a little bit of drinking, as well as a few uses of words like \"hell\" and \"ass,\" but what lingers after the last bomb has exploded and the last fight is over are the movie's messages about standing up against bullies and doing the right thing. (That and a very strong sense of \"U.S.A! U.S.A!\" patriotism.)\n|Positive Messages|: The movie celebrates the idea of the hero as someone who demonstrates courage, integrity, and perseverance, believes in something greater than him/herself, and stands up for those who can't stand up for themselves. Self-sacrifice, friendship, and loyalty are also key themes. There's a very pro-America message, which is reinforced by the strong patriotism of the 1940s setting. Although Captain America at one point professes a reluctance to kill people, he and his soldiers don't have any qualms offing tons of bad guys or using violence as their main means to solve problems.\n|Positive Role Models|: Steve Rogers/Captain America is about as wholesome as superheroes come. As both a skinny weakling and a strapping soldier, he's brave, compassionate, resourceful, loyal, and kind. He doesn't have the personal demons/conflict that mark darker heroes like Batman; he is unquestionably a good guy. And though he doesn't seem to mind dispatching Nazis and other bad guys, he also says at one point that he doesn't really want to kill anybody -- he just hates bullies. Agent Carter is a positive female role model; she's respected and good at what she does. Captain America's team is a diverse group (especially for the '40s). The bad guys are clearly evil.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent strong explosive action violence and weapons. Buildings, vehicles, and more are engulfed in fireballs; lots of gun use. A villain known as Red Skull has a monstrous/skeletal face that could be very scary to younger kids. The bad guys are developing super weapons powered by a mysterious energy source; they're extremely powerful, and some can completely vaporize people. Characters are killed, many impersonally/mostly bloodlessly in gun fights and big explosions, but a few (including some we care about) in more upsetting ways -- a couple are shot point-blank, and one goes through a propeller (blood is spattered). Car and motorcycle chases, fist fights, and war imagery. A child is held hostage. A character commits suicide rather than be captured.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting and a couple of kisses; romantic tension between two main characters. Soldiers ogle a woman when she wears a pretty dress. One implied mooning by a soldier; several scenes with Steve/Captain America shirtless.\n|Language|: Several uses of \"hell,\" plus very infrequent use of \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"oh my God,\" and British slang like \"bloody.\" Some insults, like calling soldiers \"ladies\" to demean them.\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Dr. Erskine drinks some schnapps; he later implies that he had too much, but he's not shown drunk.

While it focuses more on character and on the themes of military paranoia, it still features heavy fantasy fighting, with shooting, punching, and wince-inducing hand-to-hand combat, as well as some blood and death. Sex isn't an issue, though there's some commentary about Cap's nonexistent dating life, and he shares a strategic kiss with Black Widow. Language is minor, but a few strong words can be somewhat heard during noisy battle sequences. Like the other superhero movies in this series, this one is marketed with toys, games, and other paraphernalia that younger kids might be clamoring for.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie continues the theme raised by The Avengers about stockpiling weapons and preemptive strikes, and attacking enemies first before they have a chance to attack. There's also an issue of trust, as it becomes clear that commanding officers are withholding information. However, for Captain America, it's simple: fear does not equal freedom. Captain America believes in telling the truth, and sticking by his friends.\n|Positive Role Models|: More so than many superheroes, Captain America is a decent role model who demonstrate courage, perseverance, and integrity. He's out of place and doesn't quite fit in, but the ideals he believes in and fights for are simple and pure. He believes that freedom is better than fear, and that knowledge and trust is better than the false illusion of safety. He sticks by his friends, no matter what, and he tells the truth. He does hurt people during fights, however.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This movie has heavy, frequent fighting, punching, shooting, falling, and crashing, though it's all stylish fantasy with only a little blood. Cap and Black Widow tend to fight hand-to-hand more often than using weapons, though Cap bashes several bad guys with his shield. A showdown between Cap and the Winter Soldier is a fairly brutal hand-to-hand fight.

She continually suggests women that he could be dating. Cap interacts with one pretty woman, but their flirting is interrupted before it goes anywhere. Cap also visits his former love, now an old lady in the hospital.\n|Language|: Very little language, but some uses of \"s--t\" often obscured by battle noise.\n|Products & Purchases|: There are several toys and products now associated with the \"Avengers\" and \"Captain America\" franchise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some bad guys sip champagne during meeting.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f3c7c9dd5f4001e84c1a7": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/captain-marvel", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Captain Marvel is the first female-led superhero movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's an Avengers prequel, telling the story of how Air Force pilot Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) becomes Captain Marvel, one of the most powerful superheroes ever. While there's plenty of action violence (including guns/weapons), most of it is of a sci-fi/fantasy nature, with just a couple of curse words (\"s--t\" being the strongest). The film offers several positive messages related to perseverance, integrity, and more, but the greatest takeaway is watching a fearless, confident, mighty woman become a superhero. Carol Danvers is a fantastic role model: She always sees herself as capable, she's not objectified, male counterparts recognize her intelligence and strength, and she has a strong sense of integrity. Women support women, the characters are diverse, ageism is nonexistent, and romance doesn't figure into things at all.\n|Positive Messages|: Many positive messages: You are stronger than you think. Know your enemy: It might just be you. Don't fight wars, end them. But real takeaway is the strength, power of women and female friendship. Themes of perseverance, integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Whole film is about female empowerment, flipping gender stereotypes. All the female characters, including villainous ones, are strong, courageous, powerful, fierce. Despite operating in male-dominated fields, the women's belief in their capabilities is never shaken. They engage in typically \"male\" behavior (flying a plane, shooting a gun, getting into a fistfight) without comment. Characters are racially diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Guns are used; most weapons are of the fantasy/space variety, like laser scepter, photon blasts. A young woman punches what appears to be an old woman (it's not). Minimal blood is shown, and it's usually blue alien blood. All deaths are those of aliens. Lots of fistfights, including throwing people against walls, blasting them away. Explosions/destruction.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: A pilot uses word \"cockpit\" to imply male dominance. Other words include \"s--t,\" \"s--thole,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" and \"oh my God.\"  One use of \"mother-Flerken.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Camaro mentioned positively, Magee's Donuts shown in background. Scene in bar features neon signs of beer brands, including Budweiser, Pabst, Miller High Life. Set in 1995, and now-defunct brands of that era (like Blockbuster) are used to reflect that, often comically.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One scene takes place in a bar with signage identifying brands, but no actual drinks are ever seen.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77692647dd6e001f6c3d1f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/captain-phillips", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Captain Phillips is an intense drama based on the true story of an American cargo ship that's hijacked by Somali pirates. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, the Bourne films) is known for his visceral depictions of action-packed violence, and Captain Phillips is a real nailbiter with extended scenes of suspense, menace, and violence. There is lots of blood, but just a few casualties -- none of them civilians -- but the camerawork makes the danger -- usually death threats facing a machine gun -- feel personal. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t\"; the Somalis often chew khat, a plant that's a stimulant; and characters smoke cigarettes as well.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has a global message about how terrorists aren't the only threats, and that poverty can also be a powerful enemy to peace and civilization. The movie also applauds Captain Phillips' ability to bravely and calmly be a selfless leader who cares more about his crew's safety than his own. There's also a message that despite differences in culture and circumstances, there's a shared universal humanity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Captain Phillips is selfless and willing to sacrifice his safety to ensure the safety of his crew. Captain Phillips remains brave and clear-headed during unbelievably grim circumstances. He remains mostly calm and level-headed with the Somalis in order to protect his crew and later to buy himself time. Muse, the head Somali, is fascinating, because he is doing what he has to do for his village, even though it's dangerous and morally wrong. He genuinely believes he won't have to hurt anyone, just ask for the ransom and wait for the money. Many of the crew members rise to the occasion to fight the pirates.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Camera angles bring you up-close to the threats and intensity of the violence. The Somali pirates are heavily armed with semi-automatic machine guns that are usually pointed at the American civilians. At several points it seems like the Somalis are going to kill one of the Americans (usually Phillips). The military gets involved and plans a SEAL mission to try and save the captain, and they have instructions to take out his captors. One of the pirates is a teenager who is seriously hurt when he steps on shattered glass. Phillips is severely beaten. One bullet to the head results in blood/brain spatter on the wall.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: A few uses of \"s--t\" and \"piece of s--t,\" two \"a--hole\"s and one \"ass.\" There is also \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" and some threatening language.\n|Products & Purchases|: Toyota Sienna, Sony computer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The Somalis, including one teenager, chew a great deal of khat, a plant that is known for being an amphetamine-like stimulant. While it's a controlled substance in the U.S., it's legal in Somalia. Adults smoke cigarettes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768285af944001f1f7091": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cars", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that in Cars, the automobile characters do some pretty raucous racing, careening off walls, trees, and each other.

There are more high-speed chases here than in the original and a surprising amount of gun violence; a couple of car characters are even killed, which makes the G rating a bit of a surprise. Expect a bit of mild language, including insults like \"idiot\" and \"fool,\" as well as tame flirting between smitten cars. The movie's overall message of being true to yourself and loyal to your friends is coupled with an overt call for alternative fuel and environmentalism. Note: The 3-D version of the movie may make certain parts feel even more immediate and intense for some kids.\n|Educational Value|: Although the movie isn't educational at first glance, kids will pick up information about alternative fuel and why you should never underestimate your own knowledge and abilities. They also get an amusing look at Japanese, Italian, and English culture and landmarks.\n|Positive Messages|: Mater learns to stop doubting himself and his intelligence and have the confidence necessary to help defeat the criminals of the story. Lightning McQueen accepts that Mater doesn't need to change to fit in with Lightning's slick racing buddies.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mater is a loving, selfless friend. He's willing to put himself at risk even though he's not really a trained spy. Lightning and Mater are wonderful examples of best friends who may not seem like they have a lot in common but love each other just the way they are and always have each other's backs -- or in this case, trunks.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Much more violence here than in the original -- the evil Professor Z and his henchcars use guns, chase other cars until they crash, and even kill two cars (one with a compactor, leaving him a crumpled square of metal, the other by torturing him with their secret weapon). Several characters get \"dents\" and other injuries from their run-ins with the villainous vehicles. Voice-commanded technology allows Mater, Holley, and Finn to use sophisticated weapons in their high-speed chases.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lightning refers to Sally as \"his girl,\" and Mater flirts with Holley. Groupie female cars swirl around the racing cars.\n|Language|: A few insults like \"stupid fool,\" \"shoot,\" and \"idiot.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although there are no real product placements in the movie (aside from car models like the Gremlin and Acer), the Disney merchandise machine has an enormous number of Cars toys and other tie-ins -- from LEGOs and stuffed animals to coloring books and figurines to sippy cups and sleeping bags.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: At a party, various cars drink \"cocktails.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776ab423d5a3001f507d91": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cars-3", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Cars 3 is part of Pixar's popular movie franchise about a world of talking, human-like vehicles. The star-studded voice cast, led by Owen Wilson, returns for a threequel that's much more diverse and uplifting (not to mention less violent) than the last installment, Cars 2. That said, while language, romance, and drinking and smoking are all minimal, be ready for a couple of intense crash/demolition derby scenes in which main characters are damaged, in danger, or afraid of aggressive vehicles (one even deploys spinning saws). But the characters learn key life lessons, and there are positive messages about the importance of finding wise, supportive mentors (like the dearly departed Doc Hudson); the idea that no matter how old you are, you always have more to learn; and the fact that regardless of your gender or what you look like, you should be allowed to compete and reach for your dreams. Overall, this is a great pick for car fans of all ages.\n|Educational Value|: This is an entertaining film rather than an educational one, but there are lessons about the importance of learning from your elders and believing in yourself. There's also a strong female-empowerment message.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about \"female\" cars being able to race alongside \"male\" cars can be translated into encouraging girls to try things that may usually be done by boys/men. Also strong messages about how important experience and mentorship are to younger, newer cars (and people); even the young and talented have something to learn from the wise and experienced. Don't fear failure; be afraid of not having a chance to do something you dream of/want to do. Be in charge of your own destiny. You don't need to win to be a hero; sometimes knowing when to quit is more important. Progress and change are positive forces; we see value of moving forward and being adaptable. Themes include perseverance and communication, teamwork and the value of empathy and mutual respect.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lightning McQueen shows how persistent and focused he can be to get back into racing. He's dedicated to making a comeback but also sensitive (eventually) to Cruz's desire to learn about racing. Cruz is demanding and smart-mouthed at first, making ageist jokes toward McQueen, but her apparent pushiness is shown to be driven by passion and determination. Her flaws and insecurities make her relatable, and she's ultimately encouraging and kind. Sally is supportive but also tough-talking to make sure Lightning knows it's time to get to work. Mater is once again a loyal best friend. Female car characters are encouraged to race. Storm is conceited and rude but learns some lessons, as does materialistic Sterling. Lightning McQueen's original team from Radiator Springs are all loyal and selfless in their efforts to support him. Legendary racers Miss Fritter and Lou Nash are admirable role models, funny, fearless, and respected.\n|Diverse Representations|: Tackles themes around aging with confidence and positivity and champions older characters, who are voiced by older actors. Most characters are car equivalent of straight White men, but the smaller number of female characters make a big impact; they're presented as intelligent, funny, resilient, determined, successful, respected. Ethnic diversity is briefly touched upon when Latino character Cruz Ramirez talks about growing up feeling like she didn't belong. Her character later triumphs as a worthy successor to Lightning McQueen. Characters drawn from stereotype include the spaced-out hippie, the \"simple\" Southerner, and Italians with exaggerated accents.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lightning McQueen is seriously injured during an intense crash that involves flips, skids, sparks flying, and lots of damage -- but he's fully rehabbed. Demolition derby sequence includes fire and aggressive vehicles (including large, former emergency and public-use vehicles like an ambulance and school bus) purposely crashing into and running over one another and Lightning and Cruz. One bus has chains and saws protruding from her frame and can spit fire. Flashbacks to Doc Hudson crashing during a race. Lightning crashes while using a training simulator. Even when there aren't crashes, race scenes can be intense as cars maneuver around each other and sometimes confront each other. Tense exchanges/arguments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sally and Lightning say \"I love you.\"\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"dang,\" \"loser,\" \"shut up,\" \"dang,\" \"keister,\" \"dadgum,\" \"dummy,\" \"butt,\" and \"jerk.\" Lightning says \"life's a beach.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No real product placements in movie (aside from car models like Volkswagen, Dodge, Porsche), but there's a ton of Disney merchandise featuring Cars-related toys and other tie-ins -- like Lego kits, stuffed animals, coloring books, figurines, home accessories, games, and apparel. A conversation between Sterling and Lightning McQueen negatively (and perhaps ironically) glamorizes consumerism and wealth, with Sterling boasting about merchandising and saying, \"We'll be rich beyond belief.\"\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In a saloon/pub, race cars gather and enjoy undetermined drinks (presumably of something oil related).

The new 007, however, is darker than previous incarnations. His sly, barely perceptible smile suggests that he relishes revenge and takes pleasure in his violence. The film is full of violence, including spectacular explosions, intense physical fights, shooting, knifing, cars crashing, and drowning. Dead bodies show blood and vacant-eyed faces. A torture scene (featuring a naked Bond) shows him in obvious pain as his genitals are smashed with a large, knotted rope. One main character meets a sad demise. Sex scenes show Bond with two different women, in various states of undress. Lots of martini-drinking as Bond discovers his drink of choice (thanks to liquor sponsors Heineken and Smirnoff). The language is pretty mild.\n|Positive Messages|: Villains are ruthlessly efficient and lethal in pursuit of money and power; Bond is also brutal, darkly pleased to best his opponents.\n|Positive Role Models|: James Bond in this film is played darker than in previous versions. He is angry, determined, and often motivated by revenge. Bond's position as a cultural icon is well known, but this version is considerably more gritty, and that means there is less to look up to in Bond.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of stunts, per usual in Bond movies: animated opening credits sequence features shooting, stabbing, and falling, with bright red splotches for blood; film includes explosions by bombs, grenades, and missiles; car chases and flips; leaps on and off building scaffolding; corpse wrapped in a hammock; Bond's face and body are cut and bleeding repeatedly; bloody results from frequent shooting, knifing, and punching; poisoned, Bond sweats and gasps, nearly dying; a long, sad drowning sequence; fight scenes feature kicking, punching, falling/throwing bodies down stairs; one villain wields a sword; Bond is tortured by a villain whomping his genitals with a knotted rope.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Bond beds two different women (all three characters show nude legs and arms while kissing and embracing passionately on beds and floors); Bond is naked for a torture session (you see everything but full frontal); joke about an undercover name for Vesper (\"Miss Stephanie Broadchest\").\n|Language|: Mild language, including \"Jesus Christ,\" repeated use of \"hell\" by M (i.e., \"What the hell is Bond doing!?\"), and \"ass.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The usual upscale Bond paraphernalia: Liquor tie-ins include Heineken and Smirnoff Vodka, goodies include Aston Martin, Jaguar, Sony Vaio, Sony Ericsson, Omega watch, Bodyworld Museum exhibit; Virgin Atlantic airline (including airport cameo by owner Richard Branson); Coca-Cola.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Much drinking (champagne, martinis, brandy, Scotch) and oh yes, those liquor sponsored placements...)\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776831880197001ec929d1": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cast-away", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Cast Away is a 2000 movie in which Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee stranded on a desolate island for five years who must develop tremendous mental, physical, and emotional resilience to survive.

A dead body from the plane washes ashore.

There's some mature material, including the fact that the main character is a con man who never considers the impact that his lies and scams may have or the risks he's taking until it wreaks havoc on his relationship with a woman he seems to honestly love, despite all his myriad false pretenses. It includes some non-explicit sexual situations and a negotiation with a call girl. A character says that her parents refuse to see her following her out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion. Characters drink and smoke and use strong language, including one instance of \"f--k.\" The scene where Frank's parents tell him they're getting a divorce may be upsetting to some kids.\n|Positive Messages|: No real positive messages. The FBI finds a way to use Frank's extraordinary criminal gifts for good, eventually leading him to become a millionaire through his consulting work with banks and Fortune 500 companies.\n|Positive Role Models|: While the movie does show the roots and reasons behind Frank's deceptions and con artistry, he is still someone who made a fortune through lying, cheating, and defrauding the lives of innocent people. Carl Hanratty, the lead FBI agent in charge of finding and capturing Frank Abangale Jr., is determined to see that justice is served but also does everything in his power to ensure that Abangale is not left to nearly die in a squalid French prison.

The humor is often puerile if not flat-out gross: In addition to dog flatulence, cats flinging kitty litter, dog rear end sniffing, and toilet water drinking, a cat gets a puppy in trouble by unveiling a large and disgusting dog poop and plopping it on the entryway rug of the puppy's owners. (The puppy minutes later refers to the feces as a \"steamer.\") Cat lovers might not be too keen on the depictions of cats as being the embodiment of pure evil. Some children may be upset about an elderly character on life support, especially when his condition is used for comedy. A boy is sad when his dog disappears, and is reluctant to make friends with a replacement. The movie is mildly sexist -- although one of the spy dogs is female, she is not a part of the team, and the message that goes out to the spy dogs is prefaced with \"gentlemen.\" A boy's feelings are hurt when he does so badly at soccer try-outs (off screen) that the coach suggests that he try out for the girls' team.

From the opening F-bomb to the end credits, the movie is chock full of language (\"f--k\" is said in nearly every scene), sexuality (nudity includes breasts, a soft porn movie set, and a fully naked, very pregnant woman), and crass toilet humor. Plus, the movie's themes are actually pretty mature, revolving around two best friends who couldn't be less like each other but secretly envy each other's life. Because it stars two of the funniest actors in Hollywood (Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds), parents should expect even young teens to be interested, but this movie is definitely a \"hard-R\" for a reason.\n|Positive Messages|: Hidden beneath all of the crude comedy is the message that if you take a hard look at your life, you'll see areas that need improvement and should take the opportunity to better yourself and love your family and friends.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dave is hardworking, but he takes his life for granted -- especially his wife. He also envies his single and responsibility-free friend too much. Mitch isn't a role model at all except for the fact that he can somehow remember details about Dave's life that even his best friend can't recall.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some slapstick scenes involving Dave/Mitch and twin babies. When Mitch is stuck in Dave's body, the twins end up wielding a knife, almost sticking their hand in a blender, etc. Mitch also encourages Dave's young daughter to \"solve all your problems through violence,\" so she hits her ballet bully. Pregnant Tatiana gets very angry at Mitch and pushes him on his back and threatens him. The guys have to run away from mall security when they pee in a public fountain.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nudity in several scenes, including a graphic soft-porn movie shoot and a sexual proposition from a woman in late-term pregnancy (viewers see her nearly full frontal, and the baby visibly moves her third-trimester belly). Dave masturbates while in Mitch's body, and both men seem fascinated with the quirks of each other's bodies (Dave has an extra testicle). While in Dave's body, Mitch sees his wife nursing her baby and, later, undressing and then sitting on the toilet while wearing an open robe that shows her breasts. Another woman strips down to her thong and bra and climbs on top of Mitch, but they don't have sex. Candid, potentially vulgar conversations about sex, adultery, sexual positions (they all have humorous names), and experience.\n|Language|: The first word Dave utters is \"f--k,\" and that sets the tone of the movie. There's not a sentence of dialogue that doesn't include a curse word; even conversations with children include questionable language. In addition to the countless F-bombs, there's \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"p---y,\" \"bitch,\" \"d--k,\" \"whore,\" \"t-ts,\" \"balls,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Product placements aren't distracting, but the guys spend a good deal of time in Dave's Range Rover and Mitch's Fiero.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Mitch is an avowed pot-head, so bongs, joints, and other marijuana paraphernalia are shown regularly.

The movie includes some schoolyard-style naughty words and PG-style sexual references that get close to a PG-13. When asked about his 12 children, Tom smirks about his wife: \"I couldn't keep her off me.\" He explains that he had a vasectomy but did not wait for it to become effective, resulting in the second set of twins. And part of the plot concerns the oldest child (an adult) moving in with her boyfriend (which does not bother her parents) and whether they should be allowed to sleep together when they visit the family. Some verbal taunting from bullies. Some audience members may be offended by the portrayal of the family as vaguely Catholic, with references to Jesus and a rosary but no evidence of religious observance. There is comic peril with some minor injuries. The product placement (Crate & Barrel) is particularly (and annoyingly) intrusive.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie explores the theme of parents trying to \"have it all\"-- fulfilling careers while still having the time to be the parents to their twelve kids.\n|Positive Role Models|: Because there are 12 kids, there isn't enough time for any of them to emerge as positive role models. The parents maintain positive attitudes even amidst the most stressful moments of raising 12 children at different stages in their lives; the central conflict of the movie is how the parents, thinking they can \"have it all,\" must choose between devoting all the time necessary to pursue their dream jobs, or scale back their career ambitions so that they have time to spend raising their kids as well as time with each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent comedic pratfall violence. Someone always seems to be breaking something in the house. Young kids take the underwear belonging to the unlikable boyfriend of their oldest sister and dip it in meat; when the boyfriend puts the underwear on then sits down to dinner with the family, their dog attacks his groin.

Chicken Little is bullied by the other kids. One character is readable as gay, as he adores disco and cowers before his mother, and another, a tough, baseball-playing female fox, is transformed into a traditional girl -girl, as a partly jokey reinforcement of traditional gender roles.

In spite of the unusual life they lead (home-schooled, an eccentric father, a wacky grandfather, a lack of material possessions) Jemima and Jeremy are happy, unselfish, bright, and loyal.

At its heart, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is a ghost story, and not only are the many spirits very creepy at times, but the 3-D technology makes certain scenes -- as when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come's red-eyed black stallions jump out at the audience -- all the scarier. And the realistic nature of the motion capture technology often makes the movie seem more like live action (and thus more intense) than animation. But on the other hand, the language is mild (British slang like \"bugger\" and \"blast\") and the drinking limited to Christmas toasts. And the messages are all quite positive, as Ebenezer Scrooge's (Jim Carrey) transformation is one of literature's ultimate stories of redemption and hope, even in the bleakest of times.\n|Educational Value|: The movie educates younger viewers (in a \"scared straight\" kind of way) on the importance of being kind and selfless, rather than greedy and selfish like Scrooge.\n|Positive Messages|: Dickens' classic tale is full of important, relevant messages: Even in economically difficult times, there is hope and happiness; money isn't the most necessary ingredient to live a happy, successful life; those lucky enough to have money should be generous toward those who are less fortunate; everyone should be kind and charitable, no matter how rich they are; and family and friendship are far more fulfilling than work.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although Ebenezer Scrooge is clearly a negative role model at first, he redeems himself and becomes a positive one. By abandoning his greedy ways, he realizes the importance of generosity, selflessness, altruism, family, and the spirit of Christmas. Secondary characters like Scrooge's nephew Fred, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim are all admirable for their exemplary loyalty, faith, and sincerity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several frightening images of skeletons, corpses, and ghosts, from the very first scene of a dead Jacob Marley lying in a coffin to an open grave in scenes from Christmas future. The ghost of Marley -- along with the three spirits of Christmas, especially the Grim Reaper-esque Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (and his stampeding, red-eyed horses) -- can be disturbing, as can the hissing, threatening figures of Ignorance and Want. Some of the 3-D scenes are also intense and startling, and there are several sad scenes, particularly one in which a family mourns a young child.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young Ebenezer dances and exchanges longing looks with a woman, and it's later clear that they were engaged.\n|Language|: Some British slang like \"bugger\" and \"blast.\" The words \"hell\" and \"ass\" are used, too, but not as curses.

Characters do risky things like steal cars and climb telephone poles. Strong language includes a few uses of \"damn\" and \"hell,\" plus insults like \"moron.\" A kid almost says \"s--t.\" The main characters are grieving the loss of their father, a firefighter who died saving others, during their first Christmas without him. A boy starts to tell his younger sister that there's no Santa but doesn't go through with it. Violence is mostly cartoonish mayhem, with no serious injuries, blood, or gore shown, but viewers will see punching, shoving, knocking down, and characters brandishing a baseball bat and a chainsaw. Characters are in danger, and Santa's CGI elves are cute but sometimes scary, too. A rock-and-roll musical number has slightly sexualized background singers and some innuendo in the way the song is performed. Holiday messages are mostly about how it wouldn't be Christmas without presents and Santa Claus, but positive themes include family unity and believing in yourself. The movie also sends the idea that it can be OK to do something naughty (even illegal) if it's for a good cause. Santa is portrayed with a gruff exterior, but he cares about the kids and will do anything to save Christmas.\n|Positive Messages|: Christmas spirit is powerful, and people need Christmas to remind them of how good they can be. You have to believe in yourself the way those who love you believe in you. Families need to stick together, work together, help each other through difficult times. Brief, iffy message about gender when Kate complains that older brother Teddy says skateboards aren't for girls. Iffy body-image messages from Santa, who resents being portrayed as fat.\n|Positive Role Models|: Santa has gruff exterior but genuinely cares about Kate and Teddy, all children. He'll do what it takes to save Christmas, prevent world from becoming more violent, chaotic. He's willing to bend rules, be a little naughty for good cause. Teddy has let anger, grief rule his emotions, has started down criminal path: He and friends hot-wire/steal a car, he ignores responsibilities at home. Eventually he learns not to give up on himself, to let go of his anger. Kate is still a true believer in Santa Claus; her belief, determination make those around her better people. Plenty of reckless behavior (e.g., climbing up telephone pole, driving stolen car and being chased by police) form part of the adventure.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Teddy throws shoe at Kate's head; she reacts to the pain very briefly. A fight between Kate and Teddy involves shoving, scuffling, knocking things over, breaking a picture frame. A bad guy threatens Santa with a baseball bat. A scuffle with bad guys has elbowing, shoving, brandishing of heavy pipe. Fantasy violence includes fight between bad guys and elves with cartoon-style punches, kicks, mayhem. An elf threatens Teddy with a chainsaw. Crimes such as armed robbery, money laundering, and grand theft auto mentioned. Some scariness from characters in danger from falling, crashing, being burned, car and sleigh crashes, and almost being hit by an airplane.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple kisses. A musical number featuring \"Santa Claus is Back in Town\" has slightly sexualized background singers, women jailed seemingly for prostitution whose clothing magically becomes Santa-style dresses; the song as performed by Santa also has some mild sexual innuendo.\n|Language|: \"Hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"dammit.\" A kid almost says \"s--t.\" Rare calling names includes \"moron.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A Sony video camera. Junk food like Cheez-Its, a regional ice cream brand, and Yoo-hoo.

The film's length and aspects of the story and character details might also prove overwhelming for them. Some plot points are questionable, such as parents leaving their kids alone at a Mexican resort for a night, or that two kids would pick a lock to break out of a holding cell. Sure enough, the kids' adventure begins when they're abducted the night their parents are away. They're tossed from a moving golf cart into a wormhole and left to potentially die from frostbite in the snows of the North Pole. The kids continue to face repeated peril and attacks, including from an animated oversized \"Yule Cat.\" The cat's fight with Dasher leaves the reindeer injured and whimpering. Speedy sleigh chases are similarly nail-biting. But the kids always emerge stronger, wiser, and physically unharmed. Language includes \"buzzkill,\" \"scaredy cat,\" \"freaking,\" \"brat,\" \"suck,\" and \"butt cheek.\" There are burps and whoopee cushion-created farts. Both kids have lost parents, and Kate's encounter with her father as a teen when she travels back in time is emotional. The kids are reminded of the importance of family, and all the film's characters learn the value of love and the uplifting spirit of Christmas.\n|Positive Messages|: Family understands you best and will (or should) always be there for you. Love and family can encompass all races. You have to look inside yourself to find courage. Running away doesn't solve problems. Lying, viciousness, envy, selfishness, and too much ego are negative qualities. It's normal for teenagers to sometimes be rebellious. Learning languages is valuable in understanding other cultures and customs. A running joke suggests Mrs. Claus deserves more recognition for her role in designing \"Santa's\" Village.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kate and her family are \"True Believers\" in Santa. This gives them special status at the North Pole and means they believe wholly in the spirit of Christmas and its role in bringing people love and joy. Kate's dad taught her that Christmas isn't about where you are, it's about who you're with. Kate realizes it's time for her to let a new father figure (and stepbrother) into her life since her dad passed away. Jack learns to face danger and overcome his (many) fears. Belsnickel has lost everything he loved due to his selfish and cruel behavior, prompting him to attempt to destroy all that he misses, including Santa and Christmas. The Clauses know that all Belsnickel, who was like a son to them, needs is love. Some diversity in cast. Stereotype of teens being difficult.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Humans fight each other and elves with nerf guns, crossbows, fire, potions, racing sleighs, snowballs, time-traveling devices, and shooting drones. Kate and Belsnickel are both set on fire momentarily. Jack and Kate, who have both lost a parent, are essentially kidnapped, thrown from a moving golf cart into a wormhole, dropped into the snow at the North Pole, and left to nearly die of frostbite. To retrieve a magic plant and save Santa's Village, Jack is sent out into the dark forest, where he has to scale a cliff, which he slides down unharmed. A fierce animated wild cat (\"Yule Cat\") attacks Dasher, leaving the reindeer injured, and tries to attack Jack, but Jack sets off an explosion to scare him away. Santa's and Belsnickel's speeding sleigh rides are fast-paced, and at one point they play chicken. Belsnickel often sneaks a ride on the bottom of Santa's sleigh. A potion turns elves violent. Doug uses a pocket knife to break Kate out of an airport holding room. Delayed travelers at a Boston airport lose their temper.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Santa and Mrs. Claus kiss. There's talk of Bob proposing to Kate's mom on a romantic night away.\n|Language|: \"Buzzkill,\" \"scaredy cat,\" \"freaking,\" \"brat,\" \"suck,\" \"butt cheek.\" There are burps and whoopee cushion-created farts.\n|Products & Purchases|: The million elves in Santa's Village work around the clock all year exclusively to make toys for Christmas gifts. Santa boasts they make many times the amount Amazon, FedEx, USPS, and UPS combined could get out. A background gag replaces the movie Bad Santa with Elf on a theater marquee when the situation goes from bad to good in Santa's Village. A dubbed version of It's a Wonderful Life plays in the background of a scene. Santa and Kate land at Boston's Logan Airport in 1990, when airlines like TWA and Pan Am reigned, and Kate is taken into custody by the Massachusetts State Police. Kate scrolls Instagram and suffers FOMO. The film has appropriated characters from different holiday traditions, like Santa Claus, Belsnickel, and the Yule Cat.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Teen says, \"I know -- no alcohol,\" when his mom leaves him unsupervised for a night. Various potions are concocted that can heal animals or affect humans' and elves' behavior.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c7fad5437001f7bfbfd": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/christopher-robin", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Christopher Robin stars Ewan McGregor as an overworked, grown-up version of the main character from A.A. Milne's classic books. He's all but forgotten his animal pals, until one day Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings) ends up in London, and a new adventure begins. This heartwarming, family-friendly story serves as a sequel to the beloved Winnie the Pooh tales that have entertained generations. It's about as clean and sweet as movies get these days, but there are brief, early scenes of Christopher Robin mourning his father's death and fighting in WWII (guns and an explosion are seen, and wounds are implied). He also has a scary dream while knocked out after a fall, and there are a few tense sequences related to the animals' fear of heffalumps and woozles. Expect lots of physical comedy involving the animals tripping and falling and wreaking minor havoc. There's a strong theme of being grateful for your life/those you love, as well as the importance of compassion, teamwork, play, friendship, imagination, and parent-child relationships.\n|Educational Value|: Younger viewers will learn more about Winnie the Pooh characters and a fictionalized depiction of the years in which the characters lived. Older kids and teens will understand that paid vacations/time off weren't always granted to middle- and working-class employees, and that only the rich traveled for leisure.\n|Positive Messages|: Sweet, positive messages about the value of play, relaxation (\"doing nothing\"), and connecting with family. Being present for life and finding work-life balance are major themes of the story, as is the power of childlike imagination. Christopher Robin remembers to be grateful for everything he has in his life. There's also a clear message at the end of the movie about why everyone, not just the rich, deserves time off to enjoy the countryside, nature, or just time with their families.\n|Positive Role Models|: Christopher is overworked/stressed but eventually remembers how to spend more time with his family and friends and be grateful for all parts of his life. Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Roo, Tigger, and even Eeyore all love one another and Christopher Robin, too, no matter how old/serious he gets. Evelyn and Madeline just want more time with their husband/father. They're supportive, encouraging, and kind. Notable diversity among supporting characters (especially for post-WWII England).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Early in the movie, young Christopher Robin's father dies (not shown, but there's sadness/a funeral). Brief World War II-era scenes show soldiers at war (guns, an explosion, non-graphic wounds) and Evelyn listening to a radio broadcast about war, projected casualties. Lots of physical comedy: falling/slipping/tripping, things bonking characters on the head. Eeyore says \"My bum hurts.\" Some yelling/arguing. Christopher Robin falls, is knocked out; he has a scary dream of being underwater and seeing a monster. Pooh, other animals are incredibly frightened by idea of monsters (heffalumps, woozles, etc.); in a few scenes, their fear is underlined by tense music/cinematography that could frighten younger/more sensitive kids. Christopher Robin acts out a big fight with the \"monsters.\" It's sad when Pooh can't find his friends and the animals say goodbye to and then miss Christopher Robin. A taxi has a minor crash; animals fly through the air and hit a car windshield (they're unharmed).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple embraces, dances, and shares a kiss.\n|Language|: Pooh calls himself a \"bear of very little brain,\" and, in anger, adult Christopher Robin says he is one. Christopher Robin also calls Winslow a \"woozle.\" Other words/phrases/exclamations include \"good heavens,\" \"what the devil,\" \"codswallop,\" \"cracked,\" \"cripes,\" and \"lost his marbles.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing on camera, but there's plenty of Winnie the Pooh merchandise available.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682b8a7581001f12c540": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sequel to the enormously popular The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has more dark moments than the first movie. It broods on the nature of deceit, greed, and hunger for power. It also has a brutal one-on-one swordfight (some of the shield slams may leave even adults cringing) and extensive battle scenes that are portrayed as bone-crunching, metal-clanging, sword-lancing riots. All of the main characters, except Lucy, are responsible for many enemy deaths. That said, it's all relatively blood-free: Though characters are pierced by arrows and swords and fall to the ground (many are injured, and some do die), little gore is shown besides the odd cut on the lip or cheek. Younger viewers may notice and be unsettled by the menacing tone throughout most of the movie -- including a scary appearance by the White Witch -- though it's relieved fairly frequently with funny asides from the characters. While not overt, the movie includes Christian imagery and allegorical storylines, and the characters learn clear moral lessons by the end.\n|Positive Messages|: The kings and queens of old, as well as Caspian, fight for what is good and true -- despite many acts of betrayal, deceit, and attempted murder. The Telmarines are determined to exterminate the Narnians, whom they regard as inferior and strange, but their point of view is presented as clearly wrong.\n|Positive Role Models|: Caspian is tempted by revenge, and Peter's pride leads to disaster, but everyone sees the error of their ways in the end. For the most part, girls are portrayed as courageously as the boys -- though in one scene, a girl needs to be rescued by her prince.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of swordfights and battles, some of which get pretty brutal. There's not much gore or blood, but there's tons of hitting, lancing, pushing, screaming, clubbing, and stabbing. Many characters are shot with arrows (not much blood shown). One particular one-on-one duel is quite intense and stretches out for some time, and many of the shots are filmed up close. Most of the main characters (including Peter, Edmund, and Susan) dispatch many of their enemies with swords, arrows, and more. There's also lots of discussion of war strategy, and the \"bad\" guys seem particularly vicious when talking about how to vanquish the Narnians.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some mild flirting; a single tender kiss at the end.\n|Language|: \"Shut up\" and \"idiot\" are used a few times.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776825103a2d001f563e40": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe", "cs_age": 9, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 9+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe has some sad, scary, and violent scenes for a PG film. The movie begins with a bombing during the Blitz in London. The children are separated from their mother, which could upset some younger audience members. There are other sad scenes where animals die -- including principle characters. A friendly fox is chased and caught by a pack of wolves, who also chase the children. A witch yells at a young boy, chains him in prison, and stabs him. She also abuses her servant, stabs her enemies with a sword that turns them to stone, martyrs the lion, and leads troops into battle. The children learn to fight, then engage in hand-to-hand combat and sword fighting; one sister shoots an enemy with an arrow. There is a pitched battle with deaths and grave injuries. While not overt, the movie includes Christian imagery (a martyred, Christlike lion, a rebirth from magic water) and allegorical storylines.\n|Positive Messages|: Making the ultimate sacrifice to protect others is a major theme. Trust, redemption, and forgiveness are also vital to the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Children are fearful, and one brother is greedy and selfish, but the kids learn to trust one another and work together.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Opening scene of WWII bombing in London; a boy is imprisoned and abused by an evil witch; often-intense (but pretty bloodless) battles involving animals, mythical creatures, and kids.

In general, you can expect the same level of special effects-heightened battles/violence and minor language as Prince Caspian. While there's little inappropriate content for older elementary-schoolers and up, younger kids may be frightened by a few scenes with a giant sea serpent and others set on an island where people are routinely sacrificed. Like all of the adaptations based on C. S. Lewis' classic books, there are some mild allusions to Christianity, though nothing overtly religious is said (Aslan does reference the \"other name\" he's called in the regular world). The film offers positive lessons about collaboration, selflessness, and overcoming personal doubts and fears, and the three central kids all grapple with self-worth issues that will be very relatable for tweens. Note: The movie's 3-D images add to the intensity of a few action sequences, particularly the battle with the giant sea snake.\n|Positive Messages|: The Narnia movies are filled with positive messages about selflessness, self-sacrifice, and generosity. The characters, with the exception of Eustace (at first), are brave and want to help the Narnians defeat evil. As each of the main characters is tempted, they learn to make the choices that work for the greater good. Some of the messages could be considered religious, but it's not overt.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aslan is an almost perfect role model, dispensing sage advice and guiding the characters to make the right decisions. The three kids are also positive role models -- as well as very relatable -- because they overcome their fears and insecurities for the good of Narnia. King Caspian doesn't surrender to his temptation to stand before his father before it's time. Instead, he honors his commitment to be the best king he can be.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Pevensies and King Caspian and his crew battle the elements and their own fears that turn into reality -- like a giant sea serpent that dozens of men try to bring down with swords and arrows. There's a fair bit of sword play and sword fighting, but no one is killed. On one island, people are \"sacrificed\" to the sea, so a girl looks horrified as her mother is whisked away on a boat, presumably never to be seen again (spoiler alert: all ends well). A few characters look dead but are actually in a deep sleep. Two characters nearly turn on each other but only because they're under an enchantment. The White Witch appears, but only in Edmund's mind.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In one brief scene, Lucy looks at a couple who are flirting with each other and embracing. A star manifests herself as a beautiful woman, and both Caspian and Edmund look completely taken with her. An ongoing theme in the movie is that Lucy wishes she were as beautiful (and attractive to the opposite sex) as her older sister, Susan.\n|Language|: Some British insults -- like \"sod,\" \"what the blazes,\" \"bleedin,\" and \"thick\" -- as well as \"crap,\" \"shut up,\" \"idiot,\" \"oh God\" (as an exclamation), and the like.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/614b3f0b747a223ab9df5e7f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ciao-alberto", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ciao Alberto is a short film continuing the story of the part-sea creature-part boy Alberto (voiced by Jack Dylan Grazer) from the Pixar film Luca.

Everyone makes mistakes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alberto works hard to be a good employee. He wants to make Massimo proud and owns up to his mistakes. Massimo learns to communicate to improve his relationship with Alberto.\n|Diverse Representations|: Focuses on the life of fishermen in Italy. Massimo has one arm and thrives as a fisherman. Male characters learn to communicate in a counter-stereotypical way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Massimo doesn't talk much at first. He grunts, and once glares, at Alberto to show his displeasure.

Kids will likely already be familiar with Cinderella and her Disney Princess colleagues due to a massive marketing effort behind the ladies; their images appear on everything from backpacks to toothpaste. As for other issues of concern, little ones might be upset by the wicked stepsisters and stepmom, who can be very mean and even destructive. In today's world of blended families, it might also be worth discussing that not all stepparents and siblings are mean. And Cinderella is the quintessential passive heroine rescued by a male character (in this case, the Prince), so discussions about her meekness might be in order.\n|Educational Value|: Some good life lessons: Life is often what you make out of it; positivity can be found in even the worst of circumstances.\n|Positive Messages|: There are both positive and negative messages in this classic fairy tale. On the  positive side: Although it may be difficult to find good in terrible situations, a positive attitude will provide great strength. Happiness is a choice. On the downside: The portrayal of romantic love could mislead young girl's ideas about how real love and relationships work. Also, the movie supports the idea that passive female characteristics and a dependence on men is normal and positive.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although passive, Cinderella is a kind, generous, and forgiving person who demonstrates compassion, empathy, and gratitude. She loves animals and takes care of her undeserving, extended family. She wears a smile and keeps faith that her unfortunate situation will get better. However, her stepmother and sisters are greedy and selfish displaying great hatred due to their uncontrolled jealousy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The evil stepsisters tear the beautiful ball gown that the mice have made for Cinderella. The violence is mild, but there are tense moments that may disturb younger viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A kiss is shared between Cinderella and her prince. Plenty of focus on romance, marriage, coupling.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Cinderella is a Disney Princess, whose brand reaches far and wide.

They frequently mock her and demand that she wait on them hand-and-foot.\n|Positive Messages|: With the exception of the conniving stepmother and the obnoxious two stepsisters, characters in this movie are generally portrayed as good and caring. In the end, the good-hearted person triumphs.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Occasional pushing and shoving.

As a child, Cinderella (Downton Abbey's Lily James) loses her mother; her father dies when she's older. Both are drawn-out scenes filled with tears and intense sadness, which could upset younger kids. The prince's father also dies, and Cinderella is a beautiful, kind, and dutiful young woman (albeit one with an unreailstically tiny, corset-cinched waist) who's left to suffer at the hands of her evil stepmother (the divine Cate Blanchett). Everything about the film is visually stunning -- from the sets to the costumes to the actors -- and being a courageous, kind person is a constant theme. But the prince is transfixed by Cinderella after meeting her just once, and she has no future until he comes and rescues her. The stepmother's cruelty and neglect toward Cinderella could scare some kids. There's a little mild language (\"stupid,\" \"shut up\") and some background drinking at a party.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain, rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Kindness, bravery, love, empathy, gratitude, and respect are consistent themes. But although Cinderella's intelligence and compassion are clearly valued, she does still end up getting rescued by a prince who's transfixed after meeting her once. And Cinderella's exceedingly tiny waist could raise body image issues.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cinderella is smart, well-read, and taught to be kind and courageous. She looks for the good in everyone, treating all with respect. Her father is also kind, but both of them are pushed around by the evil stepmother. Cinderella doesn't do much to get herself out of a bad situation; instead, she's rewarded for her goodness in the form of magic help from her fairy godmother. Some reasons are given why stepmother Lady Tremaine is so unpleasant, somewhat mitigating her behavior. The stepsisters are rude and dim.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Prominent scenes of parental death. Cinderella is orphaned by her saint-like parents, the stepmother is widowed twice, and the king dies in his son's arms. There's no real scariness except for the stepmother being cold and cruel to Cinderella. There's a chase scene after Cinderella runs away at midnight; later she's locked in the attic. There's a brief plot to get rid of Cinderella. Young kids might be alarmed by the pumpkin turning into and out of a coach.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Cinderella's parents kiss. Cinderella gasps when the prince touches her waist as they dance at the ball.\n|Language|: Lady Tremaine calls her daughters \"stupid\" and tells them to shut up.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement within the movie, but Cinderella has been a Disney brand for years, and this movie will help sell lots more tie-in products, from toys to DVDs.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking at a party.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770d281ba41001faf8b83": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cinderella-2021", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Cinderella is a musical romcom retelling of the classic fairy tale, starring Camila Cabello as main character Ella. From writer-director Kay Cannon, this version has more of a girl empowerment spin than other takes on the story (it is decidedly not about a damsel in distress), as well as themes of perseverance and empathy. The romance is limited to flirting, dancing, and a climactic kiss, but there are a few suggestive jokes that tweens are likely to pick up on, like when a woman says that the prince doesn't have a lot to work with upstairs and likely \"anywhere else,\" or when a creepy neighbor thanks Ella's stepmother for the mental image that her \"blossoming daughters\" have given him for the day. While several unkind things are said (language includes \"hell,\" \"jerk,\" \"idiot,\" and \"mama's boy\"), there's no violence. Supporting characters include people of all shapes, colors, and sizes, but the main cast isn't notably diverse, and there's one comment about a man who uses a cane not because he needs it but because \"chicks dig it.\" The musical numbers are mostly pop covers, and the all-star cast includes Billy Porter (as the Fabulous Godmother), Pierce Brosnan, Idina Menzel, Minnie Driver, Nicholas Galitzine, Maddie Baillio, James Corden, and more.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn that fairy tales can be retold with new, different elements and endings.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages about staying true to yourself, not judging others based on social status or birthright, prioritizing mutual respect and encouragement in romantic relationships. Other themes include growing up, following your passion, taking chances, the importance of kindness, believing in your skills. Positive messages about women and girls, how they're capable of much more than finding a prince to rescue them. Characters demonstrate perseverance, empathy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ella is determined, disciplined, hardworking. The prince evolves and doesn't care about the social status of his potential beloved; he values her independence, confidence, talents, while also acknowledging what he wants from the future. Stepmother is vile to Ella but eventually exhibits some personal growth, apologizes for her cruelty. The queen is a loving mother who stands up to and challenges the king in public, making it known that she doesn't have to agree with everything he says. The king, like his son, exhibits personal growth. Princess Gwen is a progressive leader in waiting, full of plans to improve her kingdom.\n|Diverse Representations|: Fabulous Godmother is played by Black LGBTQ+ actor Billy Porter. Actress Camila Cabello is Latina, but Ella is not. The rest of the main characters are White; supporting characters are more diverse. Strong, independent female protagonist refuses to be a damsel in distress. A negative representation: Thomas uses a cane not because he has a mobility disability but because \"chicks dig it.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: Stepmother is very cruel to Ella, speaking unkindly, purposely ruining her dress, forcing her to accept a betrothal she doesn't want. A character jumps out of a moving carriage. Disagreements.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Ella and prince dance, flirt, embrace, caress, eventually kiss. A few suggestive jokes and comments, like \"chicks dig it,\" \"blossoming daughters,\" \"that mental image will nourish me through the day.\" A woman declares that the prince doesn't have much to work with upstairs and likely other places as well.

Although the film contains enough slapstick humor and Disney magic to entertain kids of both genders as well as parents, the predominance of female themes may turn off some boys.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages individuality and strength of character in tough situations. The importance of being true to oneself, despite rank or social standing, is shown through example and dialogue.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cinderella is true to herself. While those around her try to make her act more \"royal\" and \"dignified,\" she still likes to wear ordinary clothes and treats everyone as an equal, no matter his or her social standing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tame cartoon-style violence. Characters run into each other, cats chase mice, and an elephant runs out of control while a king rides atop it.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief kisses between Cinderella and her beau.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Cinderella is a Disney Princess, a brand that reaches far and wide.

The evil stepmother is as bad as ever, and in a few short scenes, is downright menacing. A scary carriage ride has Cinderella careening toward a ravine in mortal danger. The Prince gets ample screen time, and his athletic heroism may even make this story appeal to the boys in the family.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive story of Cinderella drawing on her own skills to make her dream come true, instead of letting the Fairy Godmother do all the heavy lifting. One character starts off devious, but gains the courage to do the right thing. Two other characters who don't reform end up getting magical punishment. There's a nice father-son relationship characterized by mutual trust, respect, and affection.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mild by some animated film standards, but still a food fight between two characters; and a nasty cat catches its tail on fire, is turned into a toy, then miniaturized, and is eventually thrown into a pond.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A romantic kiss for the bride.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Cinderella is a Disney Princess, whose brand reaches far and wide.

The filmmakers keep it short, simple, and, off-camera except for some shaking in the little girl's bedroom. Though exaggerated, outlandish, and meant to be funny, Sam's evil stepmother and stepsisters are mean and insulting to her -- some very young or sensitive kids could be disturbed by their behavior. Cartoonish action includes lots of clumsy falls, a careening car, and some stepsister brawls. There's a bit of mild profanity (\"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"fart,\" \"butt\"), some sexual innuendo, along with some low-cut stepmother and stepsister outfits, and a few big-breast and breast-implant jokes.  A girl chats with a stranger online, shares personal information, and plans to meet this person; parents may want to remind kids why this is dangerous behavior.\n|Positive Messages|: A girl chats with a stranger online, shares personal information, and plans to meet this person. A good attitude, independence, and hard work bring great rewards; a strong character can survive unkindness, selfishness, and ignorance. The film repeatedly presents one message: \"Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.\" Support and friendship can be found in unexpected places.\n|Positive Role Models|: A girl chats with a stranger online, shares personal information, and plans to meet this person. Sam has a wonderful relationship with her loving father. After his death, custody is granted to his widow Fiona, a typical \"evil stepmother.\" Fiona's despicable behavior is magnified to the point of ridiculousness -- and is mostly very funny. But Sam must find mothering elsewhere; she gets approval, love, and support from an African American restaurant manager and the waitresses on her staff. There are many teen stereotypes: mean girls, horny boys, and nerds who are teased mercilessly.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An earthquake kills Sam's dad in an early scene. The death happens off-camera and except for some brief shaking in the little girl's bedroom, no major damage is seen. There is some cartoon action, mostly clumsy falls, slapstick fighting, and a car careens through city streets.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some comic sexual innuendo (much of which will go over the heads of the youngest kids). Breasts are an obsession of the teen boys, and a source of pride for the buxom Fiona. Some girls wear skimpy clothing, a few boys are seen only in towels, and Fiona whips quickly out of a tanning booth and into a towel (nudity is suggested rather than seen).\n|Language|: Fiona frequently uses insults and slurs to punish and demean her stepdaughter. Also heard: \"fart,\" \"butt,\" \"breasts,\" \"damn,\" \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Coca Cola.

Cinderella Story franchise. Building upon the success of the other films, this movie engages the target audience by creating a likable, talented young princess-in-waiting, giving her the always-formidable evil stepmother/sisters and then spinning a musical romance in which she steals the heart of a very noble Prince Charming. Music and dance take center stage in this fairy tale, but it isn't the classical music one might expect at royal balls and palace soirees. It's contemporary, upbeat, and energetic. In this story, the Cinderella is the modern-day \"Tessa,\" who loves being a mechanic and who falls for a princely pop-rock star. It's a farcical tale as well. The stepmother, the stepsisters, and much of the plot are outrageously nonsensical, but it all works. A few comic pratfalls (a tussle, a mini-fire, the heroine held captive) and a bit of comic suspense move the story along. A fart joke, bird poop, and one \"hell\" earned this movie its PG rating.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes having the courage to follow one's dreams. Dreams can come true.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroine is smart, funny, resourceful, and helpful and learns to have faith in herself as well as the courage to follow her dreams. Hero is \"princely\": straightforward, gentle, and honest and follows his heart. Evil stepmother is outrageously mean-spirited and conniving. An ethnically diverse cast. A stereotypical gay couple appears briefly.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few comic pratfalls: Stepsisters scuffle; a man's shoe catches fire; one character tackles another.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild flirting.

Like the first two movies, this one follows a talented-but-put-upon Cinderella stand-in who lives under the tyrannical rule of a mean stepmother. The teen romance is mild and only includes two sweet kisses, but the protagonist endures quite a lot of emotional -- and verbal -- abuse from her humorous-but-cruel parental figure. The stepmother character, however, gets hers in the end, and at the very least, this Cinderella has unexpected allies who help her triumph.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's central message (other than that cruelty will eventually be repaid by justice) is that you should never be afraid to follow your passion or use your gifts. Both Katie and Luke are suppressed by controlling (and in Katie's case abusive) guardians, but they persevere and are eventually able to show off their musical talent.\n|Positive Role Models|: The grown-ups are all negative role models: Gail is cruel and moneygrubbing, Luke's father is doesn't listen to him, and the guru is a quack. Katie is selfless but a bit too self-effacing; she doesn't ever stand up to her stepmother until prodded by Luke, who's a good role model for following your own dreams rather than those imposed on you by your parents.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An adult is briefly electrocuted, but she's not seriously hurt. A boy throws things at his teen stepsister and plays some malicious pranks on her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teens go out on a date and nearly kiss. Another couple flirts and ends up sharing a couple of kisses. The word \"hot\" is used a few times to describe girls. In one scene, a prank leaves a girl naked, but viewers only see her shoulders and legs. A boy makes jokes about \"partial nudity.\"\n|Language|: Some insults like \"idiots,\" \"freakin',\" \"stupid,\" and \"crap.\" The stepmother makes cruel comments about nearly everyone. She calls her daughter \"untalented\" and tells her stepdaughter that she'll never amount to anything. The stepmother also calls a girl \"an Asian dwarf\" and pretty much says something unkind every time she speaks. Her own young son calls her a \"beeyotch.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: An iPhone is shown in a couple of scenes.

The characters who are most successful and happiest in the movie are also the kindest to others. There are also positive messages about being authentic and true to yourself, knowing and valuing your roots, and taking chances despite the risk of failure. Expect a bit of innuendo in song lyrics, and there's one scene in which a woman hits on her step-sister (who's in costume) when she doesn't know who she is. Young adults kiss, and there are jokes involving having \"balls\" and a woman dressed as a man walking in on people in bathrooms. There's some humor related to characters dressing in clothing typically associated with another gender, which feels outdated. Language includes \"badass,\" \"dammit,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"fricking,\" \"balls,\" \"poop,\" \"stupid,\" \"dang it,\" \"shut up,\" and \"oh my God.\" A running joke has people calling the main character \"pig girl.\" The film could inspire interest in more of the Cinderella Story series, and characters talk about and use iPhones and social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\n|Positive Messages|: Be yourself. Be kind to others. Take chances, even if you risk failing. Follow your dreams. Good deeds pay off.\n|Positive Role Models|: Finley remains cheerful, optimistic in face of challenges. She holds family and roots dear to her heart, treats her animals like family. Her stepmother and step-siblings are cruel, selfish, arrogant. Jackson maintains admirable values despite successful career in superficial world of show business. Some diversity. The film director is a little sexist, and there's outdated humor related to characters dressing in clothing typically associated with another gender.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Pratfalls include people slipping in mud, falling down stairs, practicing \"fights\" in stunts. A director threatens to \"beat the crap out of\" an actor if he messes up a scene. Finley's step-family is cruel to her, including making her sleep in a cold barn.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing, including between two step-siblings when one is pretending to be someone she's not. Innuendo. A couple of sexy dance scenes in the film-within-a-film, which also includes some innuendo and a kiss.

But its constant tension and often-dark mood -- it's about a decaying underground city founded to make sure humanity survived the end of the world -- make it too intense for the youngest viewers. The teenage main characters face challenges ranging from corrupt officials to a ravenous giant mole; they navigate these problems with persistence and resourcefulness.\n|Positive Messages|: The young protagonists are resourceful, determined, curious, and independent -- which presents a stark contrast to the blithe denial or fearful acceptance of most of the grown-ups. Some adult characters are selfish and corrupt. Lina is a strong female character, but there's not too much diversity in Ember.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several tense scenes involving a ravenous giant mole, which pursues the main characters very aggressively and is quite creepy and scary.

These jokes range from sexual activity in fast-motion to the magical remote posing as the protagonist's erect penis. Violence is broadly comic, including a couple of scenes where the protagonist \"freeze-frames\" an adversary, then beats or kicks him, as well as some falling and slamming of children (the protagonist runs over a child's toy on purpose). The film pushes the envelope on PG-13 language, including one pronounced f-word and another that's cut off (after \"mother\").\n|Positive Messages|: The main character eventually learns his lesson but there are no other positive messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though he reforms by the end, Michael is selfish, crude, and calculatedly cruel throughout, picking on rivals, children, and his boss.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Injuries played for laughs.

In this adaptation, Emily (Darby Camp) is a lonely New York City middle schooler who's been left in the care of her immature Uncle Casey (Jack Whitehall) while her mom is out of town. After attending an animal rescue event, Emily ends up with a cute little red puppy, who quickly grows into a massive dog. Emily and her 10-foot-tall canine proceed to have outsized adventures that include collateral damage and a bit of action (a brief brawl, a chase, the use of a Taser, a group of angry and protective neighbors), threats from a villain who wants Clifford for himself, and occasional bathroom humor (Clifford's huge size makes his toots, pee, and poop supersized, too). Insult language includes \"freak,\" \"nobody,\" and calling someone \"Food Stamps.\" The movie deals with issues related to class and isolation; while most main characters are White, Emily's neighbors are diverse, as you'd expect in a city tale, and her one good friend is Asian.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, though there are lessons about friendship and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages compassion, empathy, and teamwork (Emily, her uncle, and Owen have to work together to keep Clifford safe). Promotes importance of caring about others and protecting animals from cruelty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Emily is kind, generous, thoughtful. She's attentive to Clifford. Owen is a loyal friend. Uncle Casey, although initially immature and irresponsible, learns to be more reliable. Emily's neighborhood friends all team up to help her and Clifford. It's somewhat confusing that the head of a company that aims to feed the world is written as nefarious and manipulative.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main character Emily Elizabeth and her family are White (as is the villain). Her best friend, Owen, is Asian but could be construed as supporting the \"nerdy Asian sidekick\" stereotype, which he jokes about; he's also super rich. Emily has a single mother who works hard to care for her daughter. Neighborhood residents/supporting characters are diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A brief brawl includes people using a Taser, punching one another, slapping. Characters are chased/pursued. Clifford runs into a Zorb ball that has a person inside. Because of his size, Clifford's puppy behavior can be perceived as aggressive at first, and he does wreck/destroy stuff in his enthusiasm. Oversized Clifford's pee splatters in a dramatic way. Some tense words.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Emily is cruelly taunted as \"Food Stamps\" by her wealthy classmate, who also says she's the \"biggest nobody at school.\" Potty humor includes \"nut hole\" and \"butthole,\" as well as \"screwing stuff up,\" \"freak,\" and a jokey comment about Owen being an \"Asian Oliver Twist.\" \"Oh my God,\" \"Oh God,\" and \"Oh Lord\" used as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Apple MacBook, Honey Comb cereal.

While there's nothing overtly age-inappropriate in the movie, expect a bit of salty language along the lines of \"hell\" and and the occasional mild insult like \"stupid\" or \"knuckle scrapers.\" The few tense/slightly scary scenes are weather- and giant food-related -- which could upset little kids who are sensitive to fears about natural disasters -- and there's a brewing romance between the main character and a weather reporter. Although no grand life lessons are offered, the movie does center on a son's need for fatherly encouragement and the idea that you shouldn't compromise who you are just to be popular. The movie's plot is very different than the book's, so those expecting a straight adaptation may be disappointed.\n|Educational Value|: Not much, unless you consider the movie as some sort of lesson about not eating genetically modified food.\n|Positive Messages|: Kids may take away positive ideas about being liked for who you really are and not having to change your appearance just to be cool. There's also a recurring theme about parents needing to have faith in their children, as well as negative consequences for unchecked greed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Flint shows Sam that she's beautiful even when she's \"nerdy\" and that she shouldn't dumb herself down for anyone. Flint's father learns to be supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A hurricane of food threatens to destroy Chew and Swallow, as well as other major cities around the world. Characters are in danger/peril due to enormous falling food -- and other food mutations (including somewhat creepy headless chickens). The \"rat birds\" are humorously creepy and pop up again and again -- in one case, a rat bird snatches up the \"world's biggest sardine.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sam and Flint flirt with each other on several occasions, and in one sequence it's clear that Flint is \"pursuing\" Sam to be his girlfriend.

Audiences can expect a similar level of insult language peppered throughout (\"idiot,\" \"loser,\" etc.), as well as some menacing food-animal hybrids, some of which are predatory carnivores. Main characters seem in danger for their lives at one point, and one character does fall to their presumed death. A technology firm (which bears a resemblance to Apple) with a visionary CEO isn't all that it seems, and there's a sweet romantic relationship (holding hands and one brief kiss) between two central characters. The movie explores themes like greed, discrimination, and the meaning of true friendship.\n|Educational Value|: The movie wasn't made with educational intent, but kids will have to think a bit about the food-animal hybrids -- i.e., watermelons that look like elephants equal \"watermelephants.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about how inventors don't steal other people's ideas and how it's best to listen to people who love and care about you (like your parents and close friends) rather than those who -- out of nowhere -- show an interest in your ideas. Another worthwhile message is not judging others based on a first impression, because it could be totally wrong.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sam is supportive of Flint and his unique opportunity, even though he stops hanging out with her as much, and she's a dedicated meteorologist. Mr. Lockwood believes in his son and just wants to spend time with him. Flint, meanwhile, is naive but incredibly smart. On the other hand, Chester V seems like a visionary role model, but he's actually deceitful and greedy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The food-animal hybrids can seem scary and even bloodthirsty at times. Some of them -- like the cheespider, the taco-diles, and the apple pie-thons -- are scary, menacing, and carnivorous. Flint and his friends are in danger several times, and at one point it looks like his friends will die and be compacted together (it doesn't happen).

It's an oh-so-'90s retelling of Jane Austen's Emma, but amidst the \"as if!\" and \"What! Ever!\" catchphrases and baggy clothing, there are some mixed messages about teen sex, underage drinking and drug use, and materialism. There's occasional mild profanity, but also use of the word \"retard\" in a pejorative way, as well as calling the grunge-skater clique \"loadies.\" Some sexual innuendo: Talk of crooked penises, and double entendre over the word \"balls.\" A goatee is called \"chin pubes.\"  A teen is shown vomiting in a pool after drinking heavily. One of the \"loadie\" students is shown donating his bong to charity. A student walks to the window of the classroom as if he's going to jump out. There's also frequent consumerism: product placement of Mentos, Starbucks, and McDonald's, as well as a steady reference from Silverstone's character to the stores she likes at the mall and the fashion brands she likes best.\n|Positive Messages|: The messages are mixed, but themes include communication, empathy, and humility. Cher is absorbed with her looks, clothing, and position in her high school's social order. As such, she has a set of rules that parallel Jane Austen's Edwardian mores and restrictions. Getting high occasionally at a party is OK, but \"it is quite another thing to be fried all day,\" for example. Teens drink at a party, but a drunk teen is shown vomiting in a pool.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cher remakes Tai, the new kid who dresses wrong, talks wrong, does too many drugs, and has too much sex. Cher espouses her philosophy throughout, demonstrating that though she's smart, she also is ignorant. Despite her own cluelessness, Cher does some good. She matches two lonely teachers romantically. And she comes to admire her more serious, \"do-gooder\" stepbrother, who influences her to question her selfishness and values. Characters quote Hamlet and Dickens and read books by Nietzsche and William Burroughs. Cher's father is extremely supportive and family-oriented though also brusque and rude.

Sex is discussed and joked about.\n|Language|: Several instances of \"s--t.\" \"Penis,\" \"balls,\" \"boink-fest,\" and \"crimson wave\" (menstruation). \"Retard.\" Sexual innuendo -- talk of crooked penises, and double entendre over the word \"balls.\" \"Crap.\" \"A--hole.\" Kids from a different clique are called \"loadies\" because they dress slovenly and are assumed to be on drugs. Goatee is called \"chin pubes.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Materialism is a major theme. Jeep, Tiffany, Calvin Klein, Cartier, Coke, malls, and the Beverly Hills high-end shopping mecca, Rodeo Drive, are featured. Lead characters often shown carrying Starbucks cups. Advil label clearly shown. A student, in a mock \"acceptance speech\" for having the most tardies, \"thanks\" McDonald's and their Egg McMuffins. One of the characters sings along to the Mentos commercial jingle playing on television.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Teens drink and smoke marijuana (\"doobies\") at a party. They discuss other drugs (one mentions the beverage Coke and someone thinks she means cocaine). A pothead joins a 12-step program to get clean, is shown donating his bong to help flood victims. Drunk teen at a party vomits in a pool.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776bcd7a53e9001e73069f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/coco", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Coco is a vibrant Disney/Pixar film that explores the traditions of the Day of the Dead, a child's desire to become a musician despite his family's wishes, and the power of unconditional love. Told from the point of view of Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), a young boy who ends up in the Land of the Dead, the movie -- which features an all-star Latino voice cast (including Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Benjamin Bratt), as well as a Latino co-director and many Latino crew members -- is a tribute to Mexican traditions and customs. The Land of the Dead contains some potentially disturbing imagery, but most kids will probably get used to all of the skeletons quickly. A few moments of life-or-death peril are fraught with tension, but none of the major characters die (at least, who aren't already dead). There's also some drinking by adult characters (a shot, cocktails at a party) and a few uses of words like \"stupid.\" While all is well in the end, the movie can be dark and sad (as with most Pixar films, it's likely some viewers will cry), especially for those who've lost beloved relatives. But it also has powerful themes of perseverance, teamwork, and gratitude and encourages audiences to love and appreciate their family and always follow their dreams.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn about some of the cultural traditions (and creatures) surrounding D\u00eda De Los Muertos/Day of the Dead and what it's like to live in a Mexican family dedicated to a craft (in this case, shoemaking). Kids may also learn a bit about Mexican music styles.\n|Positive Messages|: Many positive messages: Remember that your family loves and wants the best of and for you. Love and accept who you are, and try to persevere and follow your dreams. Running away doesn't solve anything. Teamwork and asking for help are important. Gifts and talents shouldn't be ignored or suppressed; you shouldn't have to choose between your family and doing what you love. Unconditional love is powerful. It's never too late to forgive someone. Be grateful for what you have.\n|Positive Role Models|: Miguel is talented, gifted, and enthusiastic. He makes some impulsive, risky, iffy decisions (from stealing de la Cruz's guitar to running away from those who want to help him), but he ultimately recognizes the value of his family. Mama Imelda and Abuelita are very strict but also loving and affectionate; it takes time, but they eventually listen to what Miguel is trying to tell them. Hector is a trickster, but he ultimately wants to redeem himself in his family's eyes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: For those who aren't familiar with Day of the Dead traditions (skeletons, makeup to look like skeletons, beheaded/limbless skeletons, etc.), there's potentially frightening imagery throughout the movie. Some violent moments played for humor, like scenes in which a character is crushed by a large bell. Skeletons come apart frequently. A character falls from a great height. Another is shown succumbing to poison. Characters are chased/pursued; some tension/peril as a result. Sad moment when a Land of the Dead figure dissolves into dust; later, another popular character appears to fade, which could upset kids. Tear-jerking climactic sequence. Pepita, a large spirit guide animal, is like a huge flying griffin/panther, and she can be intimidating (growling, pouncing, etc.). Arguing; grown-ups yell at a kid.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Discussion of Mama Imelda and her husband's love story. A married couple embraces. Kissing/romance in a movie-within-the-movie. A \"nude\" skeleton poses for an artist (played for humor).\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"stupid,\" \"dumb,\" \"jerks,\" \"hate,\" and \"bum.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film itself, but Disney/Pixar films always have plenty of merchandise tie-ins, from apparel to games to toys.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters drink in a couple of scenes: a shot in one scene and drinks at a party.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776eb523d5a3001f52f6c2": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cold-pursuit", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Cold Pursuit is a thriller/dark comedy starring Liam Neeson as a man seeking revenge for his son's death. It's very violent, with punching and hitting, guns and shooting, and lots and lots of blood. Much of the violence is tinged with a comic tone. There's some sex-related dialogue, and a secondary character tries to seduce waitresses and hotel maids, sometimes by lying in bed naked with money covering his genitals. A married couple kisses, offscreen, for a long time. Language is very strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" the \"N\" word, and more. Secondary characters are drug dealers, and cocaine, pot smoking, and cigarettes are shown. Characters also drink in bars/socially. A remake of a 2014 Norwegian movie, this one is quite a bit smarter, and stranger, than the usual Neeson revenge movie. It also plays around with audience reactions to death, which makes it most appropriate for older teens and up.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is largely about revenge; no real consequences for violent acts. But unlike a lot of movies with lots of dead bodies, this asks audiences to ponder death -- specifically, how the living react to the dead. What makes a death funny, what makes a death sad? Why do we react in these ways?\n|Positive Role Models|: Almost all characters are ruthless killers or criminals of some kind. Very few consequences for all the carnage. Only Kim the police officer seems decent and diligent in trying to solve the puzzle.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extreme violence tinged with darkly comic tone. Hitting, punching, pummeling. Guns and shooting. Many dead bodies. Gallons of blood, including splatters, etc. A character gurgles/chokes on blood. Teeth knocked out. Kidnapping. Suicide attempt with rifle. Sawed-off shotgun. A man swings at his ex-wife; she dodges, grabs him by the crotch.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A secondary character plays at being a pickup artist; he tries to sleep with waitresses and hotel maids (he \"seduces\" the latter by lying naked in bed and putting money on his genitals). No graphic nudity. Some sex-related dialogue. Play on words relating to main character's name (\"Coxman\"). Married couple kisses (offscreen).\n|Language|: Very strong language, with many uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" the \"N\" word, \"ass,\" \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"crap,\" \"d--kweed,\" \"Jesus Christ.\" Middle-finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: Box of Fruity Pebbles shown.

Despite a few small story flaws, it's well made and just scary enough for younger teens and up. Expect to see kids in peril, scary visual effects, a monster, a few jump scares, bullies, and characters smashing things. A car crash is suggested through the sound of squealing brakes. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t\" (spoken by adult characters), as well as \"hell,\" \"boner,\" \"loser,\" and \"freak.\" Fortnite is mentioned, and SpongeBob SquarePants plays a fairly large part in the story: Oliver frequently watches scenes from the cartoons, and he hums the theme song to calm himself. His parents seem to be having relationship troubles, but sex isn't an issue.\n|Positive Messages|: Invites audiences to express empathy for its main character, a boy on the autism spectrum. Shows difficulties that come up in family relationships affected by autism, but also the beauty. Also deals with bullying, offers a positive (if slightly implausible) solution.\n|Positive Role Models|: Oliver is a nuanced representation of a person on the autism spectrum; although some cruelly treat him as an outcast, he also clearly has genuine thoughts and feelings. He's a somewhat passive character in this story -- things happen to him more often than he makes things happen -- but it's easy to feel empathy for him. The parents are more troubled, flawed characters dealing with real-life stressors, but the mother sacrifices herself to save Oliver.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Children in peril, terrified. Scary stuff/visual effects. Scary monster. Jump scares. Bullies pick on the main character (one grabs his phone and throws it).

Kids may enjoy the fantasy, but parents may find that the frothy \"escapism\" feels out of place in these unsettled economic times.\n|Positive Messages|: A woman shops endlessly despite being deeply in debt and lies to everyone about her habit -- she even riles up a Shopaholics Anonymous meeting and nearly has everyone running to the mall. But she means well and clearly values friendships and relationships. Still, her character could be seen as reinforcing several broad stereotypes about women, from being fashion-obssessed to being clueless about money.

It's more frightening than gory; no characters die (except a dog), and not much blood is shown, except during an intense demon-possession scene at the climax. But even though it's mostly based on suggestion, the scary stuff is terrifying. Language includes one \"s--t\" and a few other words but is infrequent. Sex isn't an issue, other than that a married couple is shown to be comfortable with each other in the bedroom (with a little mild innuendo). One character is shown to have drunk some whisky and fallen asleep at his desk. The main characters, Ed and Lorraine Warren, were real-life paranormal investigators.\n|Positive Messages|: The characters take on terrifying challenges, work together, solve problems, and triumph over the odds. They also show empathy for stressed characters in tense situations.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Warrens selflessly put themselves in harm's way to help a family in need. Lorraine, in particular, is in physical danger, but doesn't hesitate to help. They're based on real-life paranormal investigators who apparently helped many people.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Not much visible death or gore, but what is shown is terrifying, life-altering, and not for the faint of heart. The movie's most intense imagery comes from pure terror. The most disturbing sequences occur during the demon possession sequence. There's a great deal of screaming and fighting and some minor gore, such as a woman vomiting blood while wearing a sheet over her head (a red stain suddenly appears on the sheet). A demon scratches a cop's face, with some blood shown. One character (a dog) dies, and characters are sometimes battered around the room by demons.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple is shown to be comfortable with one another in the bedroom.

There's some bloody violence, open wounds, and gun shots, but the main issue is just how extremely scary it is. There are lots of jump-shock moments as ghosts and demons attack humans, throwing furniture around, biting, burning faces with steam, and attempting to strangle them. Language is infrequent but includes \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"butt.\" Pre-teen girls are caught smoking at school (only one actually smokes), while adults are shown smoking on other occasions. Pints of beer are seen on a table in a pub. A boy with a stutter is bullied at school; later, his experience is referred to during an explanation of why it's important to stand up to bullies. Horror fans who loved the original will definitely want to see this, as it's a cut above the normal horror fare.\n|Positive Messages|: Advocates keeping an open mind -- allowing the possibility of believing in the unbelievable -- but also advocates the idea of proof. Believing in something without proof can sometimes be faith, but it can also be a deception. Acts of kindness and helping others are rewarded.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Warrens believe in God and the supernatural, but they're also rigorous testers, seeking proof. They're kind and helpful; they often risk their own personal safety to help others; and sometimes they're simply kind, as in trying to cheer up a distraught family.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Images of dead bodies, shot with a rifle.

Couples kiss in more than one scene, and language includes a use of \"s--t,\" a use of \"hell,\" and exclamatory use of \"Jesus Christ\" and \"God.\" A supporting character drinks several beers and tries to get others to drink with him, and there's dialogue about being \"a drunk.\" This movie is a little less effective overall than the previous films, but the characters and story make it worth a look for mature horror hounds.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is about attempting to triumph over impossible odds (and nearly succeeding).

The corpse bride's eye pops out occasionally, to show the talking maggot who lives inside and offers romantic advice. The story concerns a young man and woman who meet for a marriage arranged by their parents, both families in need of money. The young man's betrothal to the corpse bride leads him to contemplate his own death, in order to fit in with her friends. Song and dance numbers feature skeletons, corpses, and ghosts. Both sets of parents are using their children to achieve money and status. And when the live bride-to-be asks the local pastor for help, the film raises questions concerning the effectiveness of organized religion.\n|Positive Messages|: Love and selflessness are presented neatly in this quirky fairy tale.\n|Positive Role Models|: The central characters are intensely well-meaning; the evil villain never stood a chance agaisnt them. They are thoughtful, caring and, for the most part, unselfish. The main character, Emily, ascends to heaven after she has released Victor to his true love, Victoria, and protects him from a dastardly villain.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some scariness (crows in trees, talking skeletons, and dead bodies with rotting flesh and maggots).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Some spicy sayings but nothing too out of line.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The skeletons drink, but it's clearly fantasy.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684485719b001f3a69bb": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/couples-retreat", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau was originally rated R for sexual content and language, but the MPAA lowered the rating to PG-13 after an appeal. But there's no shortage of sexual innuendo remaining, as well as jokes about adultery, \"happy endings,\" sexual frequency, erections, and the like. Couples are shown kissing passionately (often clothed in only bathing suits), one character's naked rear is shown, and a yoga class gets very suggestive. The language includes regular use of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" and more, and the characters (one of whom is only 20, a fact that's mentioned several times) drink frequently. That said, underneath it all, there's a surprisingly sweet message about the importance of marriage and commitment ... which may not be of much interest to teens, though they'll likely still be drawn to the movie by the cast.\n|Positive Messages|: Although the four central couples go through many ups and downs over the course of the movie, ultimately the story is very pro-marriage/commitment. None of the couples has a \"perfect\" relationship, and they all have to put in real effort to make their partnerships succeed.\n|Positive Role Models|: None of the characters are perfect, though some have more flaws than others (Joey is openly lecherous for much of the movie, Dave can be self-centered, Jason and Cynthia come across as uptight and controlling, etc.) -- but they all learn something over the course of the movie. Ronnie and Dave have the most loving and healthy relationship in the movie, though they still have issues they have to deal with. One couple's decision to break up because he didn't want to pretend to be someone he wasn't for her is important for teenagers contemplating romantic relationships to understand.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dave gets splashed with a bloody bucket of chum and may have been nipped by a small shark (but the scene is funny, not scary). In another comedic bit, a rainstorm tips a couple out of their canoe, and they have to be saved by their friends. In an early scene, Dave trains his bedside gun on a suspected intruder.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of jokes (verbal and visual) about adultery, masturbation, erections/\"happy endings,\" and several very lewd yoga positions (complete with suggestive thrusting). A man's erection is clearly outlined under a sheet. Couples make out passionately and are shown in bed together, but there aren't any full-fledged sex scenes. Two shots of partial nudity -- one played for laughs (a characterdoesn't wear boxers, so when he's asked to strip down to his underwear,the audience sees his naked rear) and one that's more about ogling a dripping wet man -- but no sensitive body parts shown. Lots of skimpy bathing suits and beach wear, as well as some sensuous dancing and massage.\n|Language|: Although there are no F-bombs, there are plenty of uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and derivatives of those words, as well as \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"hump,\" \"twatting\" (used in place of \"tweeting\"), \"balls,\" \"screw,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Apple computers and Guitar Hero are shown frequently, with the video game gettng mentioned as part of Dave's work and even played during a fairly long scene. Also mentions of Froot Loops, PowerPoint, Sandals Resorts, and Applebee's; charaters drink Budweiser.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults on vacations drink (wine, beer, hard liquor/mixed drinks) and get tipsy/drunk pretty frequently, especially once they all go to the singles resort, where people are doing body shots and more.

Consequently, the story focuses on themes about conversion to Christianity and being a good, godly father. There's no language or sex, but there's more violence/peril than in similar films -- the cop protagonists engage in chases and skirmishes with suspects that end in fight fights and, in one case, a child being temporarily taken hostage at gunpoint. Tragedy strikes the central family, and one cop's baby is nearly kidnapped when his truck is car jacked. Because of the grown-up themes that focus on the nature of fatherhood and following God's path as a parent, this isn't a movie that will appeal to kids; it's aimed at the men, particularly dads, in the audience.\n|Positive Messages|: There are many family-centered positive messages about the importance of being a \"present\" father who doesn't just go through the motions but really takes his job as a father seriously. Javier puts his morals and his family first, even if it could cost him a job. In the aftermath of tragedy, Adam dedicates himself to becoming a better father. David decides to accept responsibility for the child he never met.\n|Positive Role Models|: Adam, Javier, and Nathan are admirable men who believe that their role as fathers is sacred. Javier is hardworking, honest, and a committed family man. Almost all of the criminals depicted in the movie are African American.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few tense and disturbing sequences, from the opening scene in which Nathan follows his car-jacked truck in order to rescue his baby, to a long chase on foot between the cops and a couple of suspects that ends in a fist fight. A teenage boy is repeatedly beaten during a gang initiation. A cop uses a Taser to subdue someone. In a climactic cops vs. gang members scene, a criminal grabs a young girl as a hostage.

It has torture scenes, strong language, and smoking throughout. But it also celebrates the immense courage of two men -- Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) -- who work to save the world from nuclear war. Set in 1962, the movie depicts some sexist and misogynistic behavior. Men leer over their female colleagues, and wives are expected to cook and host when guests come over and to care for their children while their husbands are at work. Although he's the hero, Wynne is depicted as being flawed, with references to romantic affairs in his past. The movie's violence is quite shocking but never graphic and often more alluded to than depicted. Wynne is tortured with techniques such as a harsh bright light being shone on him all day. He becomes very thin, and there's a rough body-cavity exam upon his initial arrest. In one scene, he's beaten by a group of guards, with blood splattered on the wall. Other violent scenes include a man being shot in the head at close range and another being poisoned. There are mild sexual references and occasional strong language, including \"f--k.\" Characters smoke and drink regularly throughout the movie, which is accurate for the time period.\n|Positive Messages|: Courage, perseverance, and communication are all prominent themes, with characters going to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate these character strengths. There are also moments of compassion. But for every character trying to do good, there are countless others trying to foil them. The prospect of nuclear war is central to the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both Greville Wynne and Oleg Penkovsky risk everything -- at great cost -- to try to prevent a war. The former even takes on a job purely on the grounds of compassion and wanting to save a friend, and not one he's required to do. Set in 1962, the society depicted is very male-dominated. Men are seen leering over a female colleague in the workplace. In addition, Wynne's wife is very much expected to cater for their guests and take care of their children. When Wynne's past is discussed, there's mention of infidelity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Character is shot dead from point-blank range. Another collapses in their office after being poisoned. A character is tortured in custody -- beaten with batons, with blood splattered on the wall. While imprisoned, the same character becomes very thin due to torture and a lack of care. Someone is stripped naked and bent over for a rough body cavity examination. The threat of a nuclear war looms throughout.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters kiss passionately. In the next scene, they're lying in bed, evidently nude under the covers and presumably after sex. When a character is having a shower, their bare behind is seen. Reference to past infidelity.\n|Language|: Language is infrequent, but includes a couple uses of \"f--k\" and words like \"h-ll,\" \"a--holes\" and \"bulls--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink and smoke cigarettes frequently. Drinking at business meetings, social events, and in bars. Some characters also drink alone at home. Characters smoke in restaurants. A character gives alcohol as a gift to a colleague.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776830999c64001ec2e4a2": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/coyote-ugly", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Coyote Ugly is a 2000 movie in which Piper Perabo plays a struggling songwriter in New York City who finds work as a bartender in a raucous dive bar. There's one sex scene between the male and female lead in which breasts are shown, and female buttocks are covered only by a thong. Violet does something of a striptease for her beau, ostensibly to make him nervous. There are a number of jokes about the girls' sexual availability but no evidence that they engage in casual sex. Occasional sex-themed insinuations and one-liners are heard. Infrequent profanity includes \"d--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" and \"ass.\" Drinking, even drinking to excess, is handled lightheartedly, and drinking hard liquor is considered a sign of strength. Bar fights are shown, with punches and broken bottles. Gratuitous product placement occurs in some scenes: characters shown eating from clearly marked fast-food packages, and dialogue that directly mentions products.\n|Positive Messages|: No real positive messages. Difficulties, challenges in trying to become a successful songwriter new to New York City are shown. Women (and a man) are objectified for money.\n|Positive Role Models|: No positive role models. The clich\u00e9s of the story prevent Violet from being a positive role model for aspiring songwriters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some scuffles and punches, character injured by a car off-camera. Bar fights shown: punches, broken bottles.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sex scene between the male and female lead: breasts shown, buttocks only covered by a thong. Sexual innuendo in the dialogue: bartender talks of how, after they had a fight, \"we made up ... twice.\" The term \"Coyote Ugly\" is defined by the owner of the bar; it involves waking up next to a one-night stand. Talk of how there was \"not a dry seat in the house\" when Kevin danced on the bar as the female bar patrons ogled him and made bids in an auction to spend the evening with him. Sexually provocative dancing.\n|Language|: Occasional profanity: \"d--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"ass.\" Sexual innuendo in the dialogue. Sex-themed one-liners like \"not a dry seat in the house.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Gratuitous product placement in some scenes: Lean Cuisine and Irish Spring referenced directly. McDonald's, KFC, and Pepto Bismol products clearly shown.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many scenes in a bar in which patrons binge drink and act drunk -- getting into fights, making unwanted sexual advances. Binge drinking is glamorized and glorified.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776889374a5b001fec87a9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-croods", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Croods, while quite funny and gorgeously animated, deals with some pretty heavy themes: the constant risk of death and worries about the end of the world. Prehistoric times are convincingly wild, dangerous, and unstable: Rocks fall, mountains tumble, and the Earth opens up and swallows the ground whole. The frequent peril and talk of the end of the world are likely to make younger kids nervous. And then there are the conversations about parents dying and kids themselves being in danger; at one point, viewers may even think a central character has perished. Other scenes show characters battling other creatures for supremacy and food, so there's plenty of slapsticky whacking and hitting, too. Female characters do end up getting saved by males, and you may find yourself heading to the Internet to research the accuracy of the movie's creatures and events. All of that said, The Croods has a wonderful message of courage and celebration of adventure at its core, and there are strong, loving family relationships.\n|Educational Value|: While more historically accurate than, say, The Flintstones, The Croods isn't exactly 100% faithful to science fact.\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of affirming messages. Eep and the rest of the Croods learn that hiding leads you nowhere, that courage opens up your world, and that love needs to be expressed. Also, to be yourself. As one character says: \"Don't hide -- live!\" Some bodily function humor (nose picking, etc.).\n|Positive Role Models|: Though Grug is fearful and makes clear (albeit jokingly) his disdain for his mother-in-law, he does make decisions out of a need to protect his family. He's the first to throw himself over them when the Earth rumbles and rocks start falling or when animals around him attack. (He does sic his baby, who's pretty tough, onto prey that he's trying to catch for food.) Most of all, he cares deeply about Eep, his daughter on the verge of womanhood. He admires her but worries for her. Eep adores her father but isn't swayed by his fears; she's eager to expand her horizons, literally and figuratively. She pushes Grug to explore, and he encourages her to think before she acts. Ultimately, he also teaches her how to share her feelings by modeling that behavior himself. Guy also shows Eep the joy of living freely, unencumbered by anxiety. Female characters sometimes rely on male characters to save them, and Eep sometimes acts a little silly around Guy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent talk about death/the risk of death in this wild, unstable world; at one point, viewers are even led to believe that a central character may have perished. Guy mentions the death of his parents, and a bedtime story includes a reference to a character dying as well. There's also plenty of talk about the end (of the world) being nigh, what with all the earthquakes and fires and such, which could scare younger or sensitive viewers. Mountains tumble, the ground splits, and animals big and small descend on others they deem prey. (The animation is so top-rate that you can practically feel the rocks crashing down on the ground.) There's some pretty serious -- and seriously competitive -- hunting and gathering going on (admittedly in a cartoonish way), with Grug urging everyone to huddle for a \"family kill circle\" before they go nuts trying to catch anything they can eat. Characters push and shove and hit one another to get at the (potential) grub. Characters wield spears and rocks and fiery sticks and fall or hurl themselves off cliffs. It's definitely survival of the fittest, and the bravest, in Croods-land.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plenty of flirting between a teenage boy and a teenage cave-girl. They hold hands and come close to kissing in one scene.\n|Language|: Some name-calling intended to be humorous -- \"fat,\" \"dummy,\" etc., plus \"sucky.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although the movie itself contains no product/brand references, DreamWorks has merchandise partnerships with everything from video game companies to tofu.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d4847dd6e001f6f1e5e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-croods-a-new-age", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Croods: A New Age is the sequel to 2013's The Croods, which centered on a family of Neanderthals trying to survive the elements, including teen daughter Eep (voiced by Emma Stone). This film focuses on Eep's romance with Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and her dad Grug's (Nicolas Cage) worries about losing his daughter. While the clan faces all kinds of perilous moments, most of them are over-the-top and slapstick -- fending off wild beasts is just another day in this family's life. But as the story goes on, more threats emerge that could scare littler viewers, like monkeys with glowing eyes and a giant ape monster that intends to eat some of the main characters. Some kids may also find the \"punch monkey\" characters -- which communicate by slugging each other -- hilarious and try to imitate them. Characters use mild insults (\"dumb,\" \"twits,\" etc.), there's some potty humor, and a bee sting makes one character act like she's drunk. Characters kiss, and one male is shown shirtless. Parent-child separation is referenced during a flashback, and the death of a boy's family is implied. This film strays even further from actual prehistory than the first one did, but some tidbits could prompt discussions about human evolution and migration, and there are clear themes of courage, teamwork, and the importance of being yourself. There are also some great \"girl power\" moments when Eep and the other female characters have to rescue the menfolk.\n|Educational Value|: While film is mostly fantasy, a few tidbits could be educational moments. Opening scene shows migrating humans being stuck in tar pits, which could open up discussion about early humans' migration, how tar pits preserved bones so that we can identify ancient species. Comparisons between Croods and Bettermans could spark a conversation about evolution.\n|Positive Messages|: People are stronger as a pack than they are as individuals. Hiding away from life leads to a life half lived. Courage opens up your world, and teamwork can help you overcome big problems. Don't jump to conclusions. Also, be yourself -- and be open to those whose preferences and habits aren't the same as yours.\n|Positive Role Models|: Women are shown to be equally strong and as fierce as men -- even more so, when push comes to shove and rescue is needed. When it comes to romance, Eep and Guy pursue each other equally. Hope and Phil learn important lessons about judging and manipulating others. Dawn and Eep build a friendship, despite the fact that they're being positioned to be rivals for Guy's affections.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril. Primary characters are prepared as human sacrifice for a giant monster/animal; it looks like they might die. Other characters battle that monster, some appear to be in mortal danger. Characters are shown trying to survive animal attacks in a slapstick, cartoonish manner, with few signs of worry or stress. Frequent punching, especially between monkeys and humans. Electrocutions that don't cause actual harm. Flashback to family members being stuck, fatally, in rising tar pits and urging a little boy to keep traveling alone. Menacing monkeys with glowing eyes and large fists may be scary to younger children. Arguments/yelling.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plot's central focus is a romance between teens/young adults. Kissing. \"Naked\" animal butt. A male character is shirtless on several occasions as a source of humor.\n|Language|: Insult words include \"dumb,\" \"stupid,\" and \"twits.\" Some rude/potty humor.\n|Products & Purchases|: Although movie itself contains no product/brand references, there are many offline merchandise partnerships.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A character who suffers a bee sting is affected by the venom in a way that seems like she's drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b99ad5437001f7a47db": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/cruella", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Cruella is Disney's stylish but dark live-action origin story about the dog-napping villain from Disney's 1961 classic 101 Dalmatians. Set in the early 1970s, it attempts to explain Cruella's (Emma Stone) nefarious behavior in a way that will spark empathy in viewers. Think of it as Wicked by way of The Devil Wears Prada, with healthy dashes of Dickens and Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). While there's very little iffy content in terms of sex, language, or substance use (aside from one scene of implied drunkenness) -- and a couple of punches and tackles are played for comedic effect -- this is definitely a murderous revenge story. Cruella's life is in danger more than once, and a parent dies (partially on camera) as her child watches. The circumstances around Cruella becoming an orphan may be upsetting for kids who've lost or been separated from their own parents/families. Also, children bully young Cruella because she's different, and both Cruella and her eventual boss, The Baroness (Emma Thompson), are wickedly funny -- i.e., they're mean and treat others terribly in ways that may make viewers laugh but certainly aren't kind. On the positive side, the film is notably more diverse than previous Dalmatians movies, and Cruella clearly demonstrates perseverance. (Oh, and about that dog coat? You don't have to worry about it. At least not in this film.)\n|Positive Messages|: Clear themes of friendship, teamwork, perseverance, resilience -- but, still, at heart it's a story about trauma and revenge. Potentially problematic messages about identity and tying someone's \"true\" nature to their parental deeds.\n|Positive Role Models|: Estella is fearless, working hard and persevering to achieve her goals -- but many of those goals are iffy (revenge, theft, etc.); she's destined, it seems, for villainy. Jasper and Horace are loyal friends. The Baroness is unrepentantly cold, calculating, selfish, manipulative. Positive representations include racially diverse supporting characters (a welcome update from previous films involving these characters) and one representing the LGBTQ+ community.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Murder and murderous intent. A mother falls to her death on camera while her child watches (impact not shown). Main character in deep peril, with death assumed by others at one point and implied at another. Attack dogs put characters in peril, snapping and snarling. A couple of punches and (comedic) tackles. An intentionally set fire. Shock device used for comic effect. Cruel/abusive behavior, both in present and past. Arguing. Children bully a girl because she's different.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Hell\" is seen on a sign, referring to a place. \"Stupid,\" \"psycho,\" \"farts.\" One character calls others \"short\" and \"fat.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Elaborate parties and stylish couture gowns represent a posh lifestyle.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Swigs from a decanter imply drinking and drunkenness, which ultimately lead to positive consequences for the character involved.

Some of the fast-moving train scenes present some perilous moments, but what would a road-trip movie be without a little taste of adventure? The Man with the Yellow Hat falls from a cliff (but is saved by an elephant). More peril when characters parachute from a plane; nobody is hurt. Mr. Wolf puts handcuffs on George, Kayla, and the Man with the Yellow Hat, and catches Kayla with a net. There are some themes of abandonment and separation from family, but everyone is brought together for a happy ending. Positive messages about the importance of family and friends.\n|Educational Value|: As the train passes different cities and states, Ted points out where they are. Geographical landmarks help illustrate these points: the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, the Golden Gate Bridge in California.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about curiosity and the importance of family and friends. Decent mixture of gender and race representation among cast members.\n|Positive Role Models|: Curious George might have the wits of a toddler, but he sure has a big heart. He tries to reunite his elephant friend, Kayla, with her family in California. The Man with the Yellow Hat (aka Ted) concentrates more on his career than on his loved ones.

This story is a great way to start a dialogue about science and nature and follow up with an exploration of nature's changes in your own backyard.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn about spring's effect on trees, plants, and animals. George's actions remind kids that there are rewards in putting someone else's needs above your own.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages preschoolers' curiosity about nature's cycles and how springtime brings changes to plants and animals.

Media] age 3+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Curious George: A Halloween Boo Fest is a typical franchise entry, fine for preschool kids. The film treats spooky Halloween images (for example, ghosts and spiders) with gentle humor and a very mild \"boo\" factor. George's friends recall the legend of a headless scarecrow (No Noggin), but even that legend is presented in a way that is not truly suspenseful or frightening. The episode blends several story elements (it's not as linear as most of George's adventures), but the adorable monkey and his world are intact as Halloween is explored and enjoyed by all.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Even mysterious (or scary) events may have a logical explanation.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters are considerate and kind to one another. Curious George's guardian (the Man in the Yellow Hat) is responsible and caring; George is curious and appreciative of his guardian and wants to make him happy. Humans are drawn in various shades of cream and brown, with one distinctly Latino man.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very mild cartoon action, no injuries: George plops into a pile of leaves; The Man in the Yellow Hat falls down stairs; George's friend Bill appears to be chased by an army of pumpkins. There are some shadowy and brief spooky effects surrounding a haunted house and The Legend of No Noggin, a headless scarecrow who knocks hats off people.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Curious George is a popular franchise of books, films, TV, and merchandise.

George creates several messes and engages in semi-dangerous activities, like climbing to the top of a Christmas tree that then knocks down all the trees. In one scene, the Man in the Yellow Hat and his friend accidently start a fire and the fire truck arrives, but it's brief and treated lightly. George gets all the toys he wanted for Christmas. The previews include trailers (for two Barbie movies and a semi-violent Bionicle movie), and two commercials -- one for Sunmaid products and one for Chuck E. Cheese.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: The message of the movie is about trying to do something nice for someone you care about. Both George and the Man want to give the other a nice gift to make them happy. In the end, George's gift is heartfelt and emphasizes the importance of the duo's relationship. The Man's gifts for George are material items -- a lot of them -- and while this doesn't follow the typical \"being together is the best gift\" message, it's realistic, at least. The Italian chef character is pretty stereotypical, though not in any hostile way.\n|Positive Role Models|: All characters are wholly good with no bad intentions. They demonstrate curiosity and gratitude. The Man in the Yellow Hat loves George despite his tendency to make messes, have accidents, and just generally get into clueless trouble.\n|Violence & Scariness|: George engages in semi-dangerous activities, like climbing to the top of a Christmas tree that then knocks down all the trees.

This time they head west by train to stay at cousin Ginny's farm while she vacations with her adventurous mom. George and Ted encounter some mild and short-lived perils, as when they have to cross a seemingly unstable old covered bridge and ford a wide river with a herd of farm animals, but there's little here to offend or frighten. There's a positive message about being open to new experiences and trying new things.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Try new things, even when they're difficult. You'll get better at them from practice and have fun.\n|Positive Role Models|: George's curiosity makes him as open to new experiences as ever. Cautious Ted wants to protect George, but also might be a bit too worried to let himself have fun.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Peril is mild and brief. A wagon rolls quickly over a hill and wrecks corrals, allowing penned animals to escape. The trek to find them and bring them home requires crossing a rickety bridge and a wide river.

Based on the classic book characters created by H.A. and Margret Rey in the 1940s, George is a mischievous, lovable monkey whose family-friendly adventures have little to no suspense or violence. In keeping with the tradition of the best Curious George tales, this movie includes a story that's easy to understand; thoughtful, relatable messages; and songs that affirm those positive ideas. Family relationships are key here as George and a nearby kingdom's royal monkey accidentally trade places after a series of mishaps. Since neither George nor the royal Phillippe speak a human language, the switch goes undetected, until finally -- destined to be the monkeys they were born to be -- their true identities are revealed.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain and deliver positive messages rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Simple messages for very young kids are delivered through both song and conversation. It's valuable to experience life at its fullest. Happiness is free. \"Don't let fear stop you from doing what you love.\" And cautions: You can't do whatever you want, whenever you want.\n|Positive Role Models|: Curious George is mischievous yet thoughtful and resourceful as always; he's loyal, generous, and gregarious. Ted (The Man in the Yellow Hat) is a wise and dependable parent, loving and fun to be with. Featured characters -- a royal family -- learn that all \"tradition\" and no play simply doesn't work.

The humor is frequently puerile at best, including scenes were kids kick Garlin in the crotch or Murphy in the knees or call them names such as \"butthead,\" to say nothing of the frequent flatulence sound effects and kids belching. There is occasional profanity, including a scene in which Murphy is clearly about to spell out \"f--k\" to fool his young son. Before their behavior improves while going to \"Daddy Day Care,\" many of the kids engage in questionable behaviors such as drinking bubble soap and burping bubbles, yelling about how a brand of cereal \"sucks,\" and the aforementioned kicking and name-calling of adults, all of which could be imitated by impressionable kids.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Resilience when faced with challenges such as losing a job.

Directly addresses and challenges traditional gender roles, in terms of proving men can also run a successful day care business.\n|Positive Role Models|: The two protagonists turn the challenge of getting fired from a corporate office job into a positive by finding their true calling.

There's lots of gross-out humor, including a character's head literally going up his butt, a fat man squashing a thinner man in a dance battle, and more. Sexuality includes references to teen pregnancy, penis size, baby daddies/mommas, and pole dancing; a couple also kisses and has off-camera sex. The violence is obviously fake and cartoonish; language ranges from \"damn\" to \"s--t\" but isn't extreme.\n|Positive Messages|: Nothing is off limits for the movie's spoofy humor, and there are tons of stereotypes -- about everything from the kind of suits that black men wear (\"Kool-Aid red\" and \"Djimon Hounsou black\"), to how gay teens (and P.E. teachers) act, to the concept of baby daddies and baby mommas. Lots of potty/gross-out humor.\n|Positive Role Models|: This is a silly, spoofy comedy, and there aren't very many role models. On the one hand, the protagonist couple is interracial, which promotes diversity -- but on the other hand, they try to hide their relationship around others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Fake violence is played for laughs, like when the protagonist's mother is killed in a prolonged, jokey car-accident sequence or when someone is squashed by an obese man during a dance-off. A popular nightspot is called \"Club Violence,\" and patrons frequently wave their guns. A character is killed doing a ridiculous acrobatic dance move.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of jokes about penis size, interracial dating, condoms, sexually transmitted diseases, teen pregnancy, \"baby daddies,\" and \"vaginocology.\" A teacher named \"Ms. Cameltoe\" sports an obvious camel toe.

When seismic activity detected by the U.S. Geological Survey suggests the possibility that the volcano is coming to life, a team of experts come to have a look and discover, too late, that the thing's about to blow. The second half of the film dwells on the violent demise of the town and many of its citizens and structures. Buildings come down, cars crash, and bridges collapse, sending people to their deaths in churning rivers. A woman walks through an acid lake to help save her family, leading to her death. Some evacuees drive into a mine to hide from the catastrophe outside and get trapped there as debris shuts them in. Language includes \"s--t\" and \"ass.\" The word \"nooky\" is mentioned.

Remember: Not all Batmen are created equal. Even though this movie is about a comic-book character, neither it nor its flawed hero and villain are aimed at younger kids or appropriate for them. The film is loaded with intense action, from bombs and bullets to martial-arts fighting and hand-to-hand combat. In addition to the hard-hitting action, expect some drinking and a bit of sexuality. And The Joker's nightmarish appearance has the potential to frighten viewers of all ages. Much of the movie's buzz surrounds actor Heath Ledger's excellent work in that villainous role -- his final completed part before his January 2008 death from an accidental drug overdose.\n|Positive Messages|: Extensive discussion of the rule of law versus the rule of force; police and political characters who work within the system are contrasted with the vigilante Batman. Political and police corruption are featured prominently in the plot. The thematic idea of order versus chaos also figures prominently in the film.\n|Positive Role Models|: Batman is ostensibly the champion of justice, but his methods can get pretty iffy, and many characters wonder just how different he is from the \"villains\" he tracks down. The Joker is pure anarchy -- he embraces chaos for chaos' sake and doesn't flinch at hurting the innocent to accomplish his goals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extensive, intense violence, including (but not limited to) shootings, stabbings, fistfights, explosions, rocket attacks, grenades, and more. A thug is slammed face-first onto a pencil that's stuck in a table; an underling has an explosive device sewn into his body and then detonated; a hallucinogenic \"fear drug\" is used as a weapon; dogs are unleashed on victims; a man is set ablaze; cars crash; characters are bound in rooms full of explosives; live grenades are placed in the hands and mouths of hostages; two boats full of passengers are threatened with bombs on-board; suicide bombs are used as threats; knives and guns are brandished.

Like its predecessors, The Dark Knight Rises features ultra-violent scenes of torture and death that are too intense for younger kids used to the nearly comic, stylized action violence of other superhero films. A disturbingly high body count is achieved via massive explosions, kidnappings, neck breakings, shootings, and hand-to-hand combat. While there's not a lot of actual blood, there's tons of death and mass destruction. Bruce Wayne enjoys a few passionate kisses and one love scene that shows bare shoulders; swearing is very infrequent (the strongest words used are \"bitch\" and \"damn\"). The film's villain, Bane, is monstrously muscled and frighteningly sadistic, and his mask is very scary looking. Despite the violence, be prepared for kids to beg to see the much-hyped Caped Crusader's latest adventure.\n|Positive Messages|: Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy explores many philosophical ideas about identity, responsibility, power, hope, despair, sacrifice, and justice. Revenge is also a key theme of The Dark Knight Rises, which is, at its core, a meditation on the duality of humanity -- for instance in how the memory of Harvey Dent contrasted with the reality of how he died affects all of Gotham. What does it mean to be good? The villain Bane questions whether police officers are instruments of justice or of oppression and whether Batman is a man of honor or a man who betrayed a code of honor.\n|Positive Role Models|: Unlike almost every other superhero, Bruce Wayne/Batman isn't an alien or a mutant. He doesn't have superhuman strength; he's a rich man with some nifty gadgets and an extraordinary need to protect the citizens of Gotham -- as well as avenge the anger that drives him. Bruce isn't perfect, and he often makes mistakes (especially about whom to trust), but he summons his courage for the good of Gotham, even though it comes at considerable personal cost to him, both physically and emotionally. John Blake is an upstanding, responsible, loyal cop who always tries his best to do the right thing. Selina Kyle starts off as just a ruthless jewel thief, but her interactions with Batman/Bruce help her become less selfish and more helpful. Bruce's two mentors and friends, Alfred and Mr. Fox, are loyal and loving toward him. Bane is cruel and callous.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Like The Dark Knight, this movie has frequent, cringe-inducingly realistic violence on top of the standard, high-octane action violence that's so prevalent in superhero films. Some moments are horrifyingly up close and personal: neck breakings, stabbings, hand-to-hand combat, and there's also the enormous collateral damage of wide scale destruction: bombings, fireballs, massive explosions, building collapses, shootings, and more. Many, many people are trapped, held hostage, killed, tortured, and executed, and Bruce Wayne himself is injured in painful, nearly irreparable ways. Villain Bane is very scary-looking, with his mask and bulked-up aggression. The movie opens with a terrifying plane takeover/crash; weapons include guns, knives, bows and arrows, bombs, fists, and more. A dead teen boy's body is shown washed up outside a sewer grate. Batman and Selina are at odds over Batman's \"no guns, no killing\" rule.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: While the romance isn't as central here as in The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne/Batman kisses two different women. In one case, a passionate kiss leads to lovemaking, although the sex is off camera. Afterward, Bruce and his partner are shown (she's bare-shouldered, he's bare-chested) snuggling and kissing in front of a fireplace. In two other scenes, Bruce enjoys brief but passionate kisses with a woman.\n|Language|: Language includes infrequent use of words including \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" and \"sons of bitches,\" as well as \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation) and insults such as \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" and \"hag.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Part of a popular comic book franchise. No overt product placements, though some car brands are seen, and Bruce Wayne's black Lamborghini makes another appearance.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink cocktails at Gotham's ritzy dinner parties and costume galas.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683561141d001fb1580d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/darkness-falls", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this film contains countless sequences of children in jeopardy, not to mention many (mostly bloodless) onscreen deaths.

Sex and \"date\" jokes include horrified reactions to obese girl (her breasts turn around on her body as the soundtrack plays \"Milkshake,\" which includes sexual references); sloppy and extensive kissing; arranged marriages; boy's last name (Fonckyerdoder, reference to \"Focker\"); couple exchanges lyrics of 50 Cent's \"Candy Shop\" (sexual references); allusion to \"knocked up\"; uses of \"ho\" and \"bitch\"; a cat smokes a cigarette, apparently after sex with old woman.\n|Positive Messages|: Tedious, unimaginative gags about sex and dating; though the daters find true love, it's hard to care because they're only one-dimensional bases for jokes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comic violence, but gross and sometimes brutal (Grant shoots and kills bachelorettes on Extreme Bachelor; kids on a date express their \"love\" by beating up a homeless man).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Women wear tight outfits and show cleavage; references to gay men (Julia thinks one is interested in her, Grant has an ex-boyfriend), diner features neon sign that shows man tongue-kissing a sheep; \"date doctor\" has OB-GYN on his office door; kissing is repeatedly excessive, involving licking and slobbering; Jello (joke on J-Lo) has huge behind; Grant appears to fake an orgasm in restaurant (copying Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally..., and also rubbing his nipples); Julia emulates \"Girls Gone Wild\" video, removing her bikini top in a hot tub (covered with a superimposed bar); Grant and Julia kiss passionately and pull of clothes, then scene cuts to post-sex conversation in bed; Andi mimics Paris Hilton and others (wearing bikini, wet, gyrating, rubbing hamburgers and other foods on her body).\n|Language|: Obnoxious language, used frequently: s-word, \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"ass\", \"d--khead\" (written), slang for sex (\"lots of tail\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Rediwhip; Vagisil; Cosmopolitan magazine; T-Mobile Sidekick; Trio 650.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Cat smokes cigarette, references to smoking in a diary.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776971f617c9002015fb21": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the darker, more violent sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in which the apes take arms against a post-super-virus group of human survivors. Dawn has a higher body count than Rise (with a couple of particularly upsetting deaths), and the violence is more militant/weapons-based than the first film's animal abuse and torture. There's also a bit more language (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" one \"f--king\") and drinking, but overall the film's jump-worthy moments and intense action sequences make this a thrilling post-apocalyptic movie for both teens and parents. The opposing takes on peace versus war may even spark interesting conversations about history, politics, and war.\n|Positive Messages|: The messages in the movie focus on trust, diplomacy, and peacekeeping. Caesar wants to protect the apes, but he also refuses to see all humans as evil torturers. His human counterpart, Malcolm, similarly understands that the apes want what the remaining humans want: to live with their community without fear or danger. There's also a positive message about fathers protecting their sons and sons learning from and looking out for their fathers.\n|Positive Role Models|: Caesar wants to peacefully co-exist with humans -- with the apes in their part of the world and remaining humans in theirs. He doesn't see all humans as evil or a threat. Caesar is a strong leader as well as a loving father and mate. He urges apes to seek out peace and family, not hatred and vengeance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: More weapons-based violence and a higher overall body count in this film than its predecessor, with apes storming an armory and using the guns. Koba in particular becomes bloodthirsty for war with the humans, and he personally kills humans by crushing them, shooting them, and setting them on fire. Humans retaliate with their own guns, killing many apes. A couple of the deaths are particularly upsetting. Unlike the first movie, there's ape-on-ape violence, with Koba shooting, terrorizing, and in one case killing a fellow ape by throwing him off a ledge. Apes who don't agree with his methods are rounded up and imprisoned. A man is willing to die to kill a lot of apes. An early scene that shows apes hunting has a few scary moments, particularly with a huge bear.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adults in a monogamous relationship are shown embracing and sleeping next to each other, and an ape couple caresses and hugs.\n|Language|: More than in the previous film: a few uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"bulls--t,\" as well as one \"f--king\" (as an exclamation, not a reference to sex).\n|Products & Purchases|: A few glimpses of old electronics that have been temporarily powered: an Apple iPad, a Canon video camera, and a couple of trucks, as well as a 76 gas station.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink alcohol, as does an ape.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768247e9a3c0020c6a8f7": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dead-poets-society", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dead Poets Society has very uplifting messages especially for teens about seizing the day and embracing poetry as a way toward thinking for yourself and positive self-expression. But it also deals with the suicide of one of the main characters (the gunshot isn't shown, but the parents are shown holding their son afterward, hysterical). Everyone smokes a lot (mostly a reflection of the time mixed with teen rebellion) and one main character drinks shots at a high school party.\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of nuggets of wisdom mostly spoken by Professor Keating: Think for yourselves, savor words and language, \"words and language can change the world,\" and you should constantly look at things in a different way. Major themes include compassion and integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Almost goes without saying that kids pushed like crazy to succeed will rebel. The boys here smoke quite a bit and sneak out of the school repeatedly, but they sneak out to read poetry and bond. One boy lies to his seemingly heartless father so he can perform in a play. Professor Keating clearly cares a lot about his students. Authority figures in the school stoop to scapegoating one teacher and pitting students against him in order to keep order after a tragedy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One of the boys commits suicide off-screen via gun shot; parents are shown afterward hysterical as they hold him.

It has lots of graphic violence, sex (including partial nudity), adult humor, and nonstop strong language. Unlike most other Marvel superhero films, which only hint at romance, include just a few curse words, and skip the gore, Deadpool is decidedly grown-up, bloody, and raunchy by comparison. Expect words like \"f--k\" in nearly every scene, plus \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and much more. The violence is close-up and bloody, ranging from torture and decapitation to dismemberment, brains oozing out of skulls, brutal hand-to-hand combat, and more. A racy sex montage includes naked breasts, as does a scene set in a strip club; there's also a scene where Deadpool fights while naked -- both his butt and quick, obscured glimpses of his genitals are visible. Adults also smoke and drink. All of that said, the story does ultimately promote teamwork, collaboration, and love.\n|Positive Messages|: Explores how someone can be \"super\" but not a \"hero\" and how mutants/people with extra abilities struggle with the tension between being selfless/helping others and following their own agenda. Ultimately promotes teamwork, alliances, collaboration, and love.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lots of iffy/questionable behavior, but Wade clearly loves Vanessa and will do anything possible to protect her (and she loves him, too).

Adults also smoke, drink, and use drugs, and there are some sexual references, although fewer than in the first film (and there's no sexual nudity this time around -- just glimpses of a bare baby butt and quick-flash shot of baby genitals, played for humor). Despite all of this, the story does ultimately promote teamwork, collaboration, empathy, and believing that people, particularly kids, can change.\n|Positive Messages|: Deadpool/Wade has his own, very violent code of justice/morality, which frequently results in slaughter. But the movie also explores how superheroes/mutants/people with extra abilities struggle between helping others and following their own agenda/priorities. Ultimately promotes friendship, responsibility, teamwork, alliances, collaboration, and love. Clear lesson about how children can change lives: \"Kids give us a chance to be better than we were.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Lots of extremely iffy, outright illegal behavior, but Wade follows his own code faithfully; it mostly involves justice against those who've done big wrongs. He clearly loves Vanessa and will do anything to protect her. Three X-Men help Deadpool even though it's not their fight. Russell is badly traumatized and searching for someone to bond with; he's desperate for connection. Deadpool reiterates the idea that life boils down to a few precious choices and moments.

The central figure is a glamorous heiress (Gal Gadot) who marries her best friend's fianc\u00e9 (Armie Hammer). Racy moments include passionate kissing, references to sex, and the honeymooning couple grinding against each other while fully clothed. As the movie's title suggests, there's a good deal of murder in the story (involving knives and guns), and while it's all meant to shock and startle, only one death is accompanied by blood and packed with emotion. Suicidal ideation and behavior are present, and there's a flashback to wartime battlefield violence and a close-up of a grisly wound (accompanied by a positive message about acceptance). Characters drink throughout, and there are references to smoking. Women are portrayed as intelligent and shrewd, and supporting characters have been updated in a way that reflects a more diverse world than the one Christie wrote about.\n|Positive Messages|: No resounding message, but film does indicate that you can't get away with murder -- or any crime, at least not with Poirot around. Money brings more problems than pleasures.\n|Positive Role Models|: Poirot uses his sharp intellect to solve tricky puzzles.

Women are depicted as smart, independent, confident.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Knives and guns used in murders, although impact isn't graphic. One emotional death, with blood. War violence includes explosions, guns. Lingering shot of a gruesome injury, although the character is shown soon after, reflecting that the wound had healed.

In this latest entry, a stoic newcomer to the largest privately-run prison in the world, \"The Sprawl,\" attempts to win the upcoming Death Race and dethrone the prison's diabolical leader. Violence, brutality, sexuality, and profanity are in central focus from beginning to end. Countless deaths are caused by gunfire, explosions, knifings, decapitation, and savage hand-to-hand combat. Cameras focus on bloody corpses, dismemberment, and out-of-control beatings to the death. While some women take part in the violent action, others are set up as sex objects, writhing in a strip club, exposing themselves (both breasts and full-frontal nudity) and lasciviously seductive.

Still, the content isn't inappropriate for teens: There's some passionate kissing and a good bit of discussion about sex (including implications of a lesbian college fling and passing mention of a threesome), but nothing graphic; language is mostly on the mild side (\"s--t\" is only used in one scene, though it carries a lot of weight when it is used); and there's no violence. Several scenes do feature social drinking (a few also show Will drunk) and smoking; one sequence in particular makes sharing a cigarette break seem like a romantic, intimate experience. Divorce is also an issue here; the main character's tween daughter is upset by her parents' impending split and wants them to reconcile.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters are all flawed but very human, with mostly good intentions. Will and Maya's mom clearly care for her very much and want to protect her from their problems. One character cheats on another; another kisses someone when he's dating someone else. Some pressure for a journalist character to compromise her ethics. Lots of discussion of politics and ideals, particularly concerning Bill Clinton's presidency.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some sharp words exchanged in a couple of scenes. Will breaks a bottle in anger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several scenes of passionate kissing, some of which take place in bed (though characters are never naked). Regular discussion of sex/sex life (or lack thereof); Will's roommate talks about his one-night stand, and Will mentions the possibility of a threesome or foursome at one point (prompting Maya to ask what that is). Characters cheat/stray. Sections from a character's college diary suggest a lesbian fling. TV footage from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Early scenes show parents of grade schoolers upset because their kids have gotten a sex-ed lesson; this results in the kids (particularly Maya) talking about \"penises\" and \"vaginas\" and \"thrusting\" and asking questions about their parents' sex lives.\n|Language|: Pretty mild; infrequent use of words like \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" and \"hell.\" \"S--t\" is used a handful of times in one scene.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brief appearances by Corona beer, Pepsi, NYC hotels and other landmarks. Specific cigarette brands are mentioned, and there's a quick reference to Quaker Oats/Froot Loops, but the biggest \"brand\" is Bill Clinton and the Democratic party.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters drink beer, wine, and liquor, mostly in social settings. A few scenes in which Will is obviously drunk (motivated by frustration over where he's at in life). Will and April both smoke in the early-'90s scenes (though present-day Will has quit and tells Maya that he was stupid to have ever smoked); in one scene, they bet each other whose cigarette will burn faster -- the ensuing \"race\" makes smoking seem glamorous and almost romantic. Some minor smoking by other characters.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769b5ad5437001f76597f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/delivery-man", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Delivery Man isn't your typical raunchy Vince Vaughn \"frat pack\" comedy. It's an American remake of a well-respected 2011 French-Canadian dramedy, Starbuck, about a 40-something slacker who discovers 142 of his biological children from anonymous sperm donation demand to know his identity. The movie, while mostly a comedy, contains some surprisingly heavy themes such as drug addiction, disability, and a potentially offensive abortion joke. The humor can be mature and sexual in nature (since Vaughn's character is famous for donating sperm more than 600 times, there are countless masturbation jokes), and there is drug use (a young woman overdoses on heroin) and marijuana plants (the main character tries to grow it at home) in the movie. Occasionally there's language (\"s--t,\" \"bitch\"), but it's not overwhelming. Parents and teens who see it should be able to discuss parenthood and how it changes your life (hopefully for the better).\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has positive messages about the importance of fathers and the idea that family isn't limited to the traditional idea of a mother, father, and kids. David's story also indicates how fatherhood changes a man and makes him more aware of what he has to offer his children.\n|Positive Role Models|: David \"gets a life\" beyond thinking about himself, growing pot, and occasionally contacting his girlfriend. He becomes more responsible and realizes fatherhood gives his life purpose. David's father helps him see that parents love their children unconditionally and would sacrifice everything they have to make their kids' lives better. A group of the kids each teach David something and he acts like an anonymous guardian angel who pops into their lives to make something good happen.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's a disturbing scene when a young woman overdoses on heroin (she has a belt wound around her arm and a needle is next to her on the bed). Enforcers nearly drown both Dave and later his father in a bathtub looking for their boss' money.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: While there are just a few kisses in the movie (straight and gay), there are plenty of jokes about sperm donation and masturbation. Before his identity is revealed, David is called \"The Masturbator\" in the press for donating more than 600 times to a fertility clinic. The masturbation jokes are frequent once the case goes public.\n|Language|: Occasional language includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"what the hell,\" \"damn,\" \"loser,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands include: Isuzu delivery truck; Gourmet Garage supermarket; several references to the New York Knicks (including a game and an assortment of memorabilia); Apple products.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: David grows marijuana at home. One of his 533 kids is a young woman who's addicted to drugs; she overdoses on heroin and is rushed to the hospital. Grown-ups drink, and one of David's adult sons is so drunk he has to be physically placed in a cab home.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682985719b001f3a14bd": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-departed", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this film is not for kids -- but many will want to see it due to the incredibly heavy promotion during TV shows popular with kids. It's far too graphically violent for those under 17, including images of heads being shot and spurting blood, limbs being broken, bodies sprawled and bloody, and expressions of pain by victims of shootings and beatings. Sexual imagery includes a scene in a porn theater that cuts to the screen (the actors are engaged in sexual activity, but no X-rated shots are visible) and frequent sexual slang (some of which is homophobic). Characters smoke in almost every scene, and drink occasionally, and Billy takes pills throughout the film, indicating his increasing paranoia and depression.\n|Positive Messages|: Both cops and criminals lie and abuse one another as a matter of course; men's bonding and competing are similarly violent.\n|Positive Role Models|: Everybody seems to be working for someone else and it's hard to distinguish who is really the good guy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Explicit, bloody, frequent violence: shooting (blood sprayed on surfaces), stabbing, head-bashing, shoot-out, suicide, car crash, kicking, exploding; a body thrown off a roof bleeds on impact; cops joke about bloody corpse/crime scenes and photos; a thug pounds on Billy's broken arm to ensure that there's no listening device in the cast; Frank fiddles with a bloody hand in a plastic bag while discussing plans; crooks burn down their hideout to avoid discovery; Billy worries about his coolness while working with a \"mass murderer.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of sex scenes show nudity (bodies in bed); Frank's girlfriend appears in underwear and they share sexual banter; recurrent sexual slang (\"d--k,\" \"c-nt,\" \"screw,\" \"whore,\" etc.); scene in porn theater includes brief shots of nude bodies and moaning sounds; Frank accuses priests of sexual abuse (using explicit language, like \"p--ker\"); Madolyn alludes to Colin's inabilty to perform sexually (\"Do you want to talk about last night?\"); Frank harasses teenager by asking if she's \"started [her] period yet.\"\n|Language|: Frequent use of \"f--k\" (200+ instances); derogatory uses of \"queen,\" \"homo,\" \"guinea,\" \"mick\" other profanity (\"douchebag,\" \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" etc.).\n|Products & Purchases|: Background imagery in bars (for example, Coca Cola or beer logos).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Frequent cigarette-smoking; drinking in bars (sometimes leading to drunkenness); Billy asks for Valium, then takes prescription anti-depressants repeatedly.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776af0594b2b001e6ca221": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/descendants", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Descendants is a highly anticipated Disney movie that's packed with familiar faces like Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, and Booboo Stewart. It blends the continuing story of many fairy tale favorites -- and favorite villains -- as it follows new relationships forged between their teenage kids. The main characters wrestle with pressures of good and evil, and their parents nudge them toward unsavory behavior like trickery, lying, and stealing. On the other hand, the teens are influenced in positive ways by people who are patient, caring, and forgiving. Much of the story follows a blossoming romance between two teens, and they share a couple of kisses. Young kids might need some reassurance during a tense scene in which a character turns into a massive dragon. The movie's soundtrack is bound to win some fans as well, so be prepared for your kids to want to buy it.\n|Educational Value|: The movie entertains rather than to educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages of self-empowerment and following your heart, which guides the main characters to choose good over evil and be true to themselves. Unfortunately, doing so puts them at odds with their parents, who want the teens to be bad, but the overall message is a positive one. Racial diversity is a welcome change to some classic characters. The importance of not prejudging people is a recurring theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mal and her friends wrestle with their parents' expectations of evil and their growing desire to be good. Maleficent tries to force her beliefs on her daughter, but she suffers consequences for it. Ben's determination to see past stereotypes is what sets these positive changes in motion.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A scary scene shows a woman turn into a menacing dragon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting between teens.

This movie is decidedly darker than the first, with a lengthy sword battle playing out over the fate of Auradon's king-to-be, Ben, and a conniving villain bent on winning at all costs. Mal's struggle with her inner demons also has some serious themes and tense moments, and a happy ending isn't always guaranteed. That said, Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos continue to be positive examples of living life by your own moral compass instead of by what others tell you to believe, and there are many instances that celebrate strong female characters who challenge traditional (and fairy-tale, especially) gender roles. Expect to see some kissing between teens in this roundly entertaining movie.\n|Educational Value|: Intends to entertain rather than to educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Kids see Mal wrestle with an uncertain identity, feeling expectations to act a certain way while her inner self leads her in a different direction. While she's not inherently wicked, she learns to acknowledge that her baddie past continues to influence her in ways that make her different from most of Auradon's residents, but it works for her. Strong themes of friendship, honesty, communication, and individualism. Lonnie challenges gender roles and gains the respect of her peers by her determination and skill.\n|Positive Role Models|: At the story's start, Mal fears that being different from her peers means that they're right and she's wrong. Instead of embracing what makes her different, she tries in vain to reject it and be someone else. It's only when she acknowledges that she's unique and is honest with her friends that she's truly happy. Other characters model positive qualities like patience, sympathy, and determination.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some suspense as Uma and Mal battle with swords over Ben's fate. Mal transforms into a dragon and Uma into a sea creature, which could be scary for young kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mal and Ben's relationship continues to evolve, and other teens start to pair up as well.

The movie presumes viewers' familiarity with the characters and relationships from the first two films, so you may be a little lost if this is the first of the three you watch. A love affair continues between two main characters, and there are a few kisses on-screen. Another teen's jealousy makes her use magic to try to sway the affections of her crush, and the citizens pay the price when they're put under her spell. On the other hand, characters who appear to be villainous surprise with actions that are anything but, which has a positive influence on others and helps to change the way the two kingdoms relate. Expect some choreographed fighting (a swordfight that's set to a song-and-dance number, for instance) and a few scenes in which characters' safety is in question briefly (a villain shoots laser beams at teens and knocks them down; a princess uses magic to injure her enemy), but nothing lasts for long. What stand out in this story are messages about tolerance, second chances, forgiveness, and accepting both the good and the bad in people.\n|Educational Value|: This movie intends to entertain rather than to educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Kids see Mal wrestle with conflicting loyalties to Auradon and the Isle of the Lost. With help of her friends from both places, she makes a decision that promises to benefit everyone. A main character's dabble with darkness has dire consequences for people she cares about; she learns a valuable lesson as a result. Forgiveness, mutual respect go a long way to mend fences between former enemies and within family spats. Group scenes in Auradon often feature a character who uses a wheelchair.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mal tries to take care of everyone on her own but eventually learns value of relying on others to help. When given the chance, villains become heroes and counter the idea that people can be defined as \"good\" or \"bad.\" Mal lies to her friends about her intentions throughout part of the movie but owns up to it in the end.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hades hits Mal and her friends with laser blasts, knocks them down. Mal is injured by magic from Audrey's scepter while in her dragon form and needs help from a friend to recover her strength. Audrey puts a spell on the residents of Auradon, putting some to sleep, turning others to stone. Choreographed dance number involves swordfight between knights in armor and heroes.

Yes, you can expect mild insults like \"stupid\" and \"poop\" and a lot of action sequences involving high-tech weapons that blast things to smithereens, as well as some scenes that imply injury -- although no one is ever killed or seriously injured. But the most potentially disturbing aspect of the movie is the way that adoption is depicted -- at least at first. Families with adopted children may feel extra-sensitive about the way that orphans, orphanage directors, and the entire adoption process is handled. It's all played for laughs, yes, but some of it feels a little grim. Still, the movie's overall message is that even someone considered \"evil\" can have a change of heart, and that's a good lesson, considering that most movies portray good and evil as absolutes. (Note: The movie is being shown in 3-D in some theaters, which could make certain portions more intense for young viewers.)\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn that even so-called \"evil\" people are still human beings who long to be recognized and loved. Gru shows that not all \"evil\" people are unredeemable.\n|Positive Messages|: Although ultimately all ends well and Gru and the girls form a happy family and learn that even \"bad guys\" can have a change of heart, some themes/lines in the movie could be upsetting for families with adopted children. Gru initially adopts the kids (in a very easy manner) for selfish reasons, and then he actually returns them to the orphanage. And Miss Hattie says some intentionally hurtful things to the the girls (like \"You're never going to be adopted. You know that, don't you?\") and portrays orphanage directors as cold-hearted and unfeeling. She puts the girls in a \"Box of Shame\" as punishment and forces kids to do manual labor. Some crude humor, as when a minion photocopies his rear end, and some butt-shaking dance moves.\n|Positive Role Models|: The girls are strong role models amidst all the villains. They're sweet, helpful, and generous, and they take care of and comfort each other, even when other adults can't step into care-giving roles. Gru, though a villain, changes for the better, learns compassion, and ends up with the family bonds he always wanted.\n|Violence & Scariness|: All of the violence is cartoonish and doesn't feel realistic -- though there are lots of jokes and gags about super weapons and crime, as well as one potentially upsetting scene in which a little girl is put in a \"nail box\" and a squished juice box briefly implies blood (but no one is hurt). The Minions \"communicate\" with each other through slapstick moves like punches and shoves. There's a Bank of Evil that bankrolls villains' high-concept crimes -- like stealing the wonders of the world (or, in Gru's case, the moon). Several explosions and gun violence that never quite kills anyone but does  injure folks and sends a couple of characters into orbit.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Mild insults and minor swear words like \"suckers,\" \"stupid,\" \"poop,\" \"shoot,\" \"butt,\" and \"loser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No actual products within the film, but tons of off-line marketing/licensing tie-ins, from books and apps to a wide variety of toys, clothes, home decor, and much more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768f3fb0d55001f51dd4a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/despicable-me-2", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Despicable Me 2, the sequel to 2010's hit supervillain adventure Despicable Me, features gadgets and weapons like the original, but now with the aim of stopping \"evil\" instead of perpetrating it. There's a romantic subplot between Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig), an Anti-Villain League agent. Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) has her first crush and boyfriend as well, although both couples mostly flirt and stare at each other (the adults do kiss). Language is mild (\"nutjob,\" \"sheep's butt\"), and the violence is cartoonish and silly but does include biological weapons and a taser gun. Mexican restaurant owner Eduardo is depicted somewhat stereotypically (his restaurant is Salsa and Salsa, he has a pet chicken he calls el pollito, and he throws a lavish Cinco de Mayo party). Otherwise, this is a minions-filled animated adventure for the entire family.\n|Educational Value|: As with the first movie, kids will learn that all families aren't alike and that even if you think you're ugly and undesirable, that's not true, and there are people who will appreciate and love you.\n|Positive Messages|: The strong bond between fathers and daughters is stressed, as is the importance of open communication between parents and children, as well as romantic partners. Gru's love story shows that even people who consider themselves unlovable can find love. That said, some have criticized the way that Gru's potential dates are depicted (either unattractive or plastic surgery-enhanced) and how the movie makes it seem that Gru and the girls need a wife/mother to complete their family. But Gru was actually perfectly happy raising the girls with just his minions as helpers and wasn't \"looking\" for a wife. And Lucy is a remarkable woman who fits in with the family because she and Gru respect each other, not \"just\" because she's a woman.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gru is a great dad: He's protective, compassionate, and sweet and will stop at nothing to make sure that his girls are safe. Dr. Nefario redeems himself by making it clear that Gru and the girls are his family. The sisters adore their dad and are good to each other. Lucy sees past Gru's aloof exterior to the kind of father he is to the girls. With teamwork and smarts, Gru and the girls save the world from an army of mutated minions. The owner of a Mexican restaurant is depicted somewhat stereotypically.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Because Gru is happy and no longer a supervillain, there's not as much violence this time around. There are cartoonish scenes in which Gru and his minions are tasered, but the only \"real\" violence is near the end, when (possible spoiler alert!) the minions are transformed into purple killing machines (although strangely still cute) that can destroy everything around them. Lucy is taken hostage. The minions become weapons, and Gru and the girls must use antidote-filled guns to turn them back into the harmless yellow creatures we all love. The bad guy threatens Gru with knives. A chicken has a vendetta against Gru and Lucy.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Gru goes on a date. Gru and Lucy fall in love and kiss. Young Margo falls for Antonio, and the two dance and hold hands.\n|Language|: Mild insults like \"nutjob,\" \"sheep's butt,\" and \"Gruties\" (a mix of \"Gru\" and \"cooties\").\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement in the movie, but Despicable Me (especially the minions) has plenty of merchandise tie-ins and even a big ride at Universal Studios Orlando.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768255af944001f1f65a9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-devil-wears-prada", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Devil Wears Prada is a 2006 movie about an aspiring journalist who moves to New York and lands what many would consider to be a dream job: working as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of the world's premiere fashion magazine. But she finds out that the editor also has a reputation for being a demanding perfectionist who can be quite vicious when her high standards are not met. The movie features cruel judgments about body size and fashion. Characters are materialistic and catty (usually as comedy, though some hurtful comments are also made). Characters use moderate language (\"s--t\") and drink alcohol. Lots of mentions of high-end fashion brands. Andi has sex with a writer on their first date (after admitting she's drunk), then regrets it. Younger kids won't be interested, since the subject matter won't mean anything to them. The movie could inspire discussion about how women in positions of power are perceived differently than men -- a point Andi makes toward the movie's end.\n|Positive Messages|: The importance of being true to yourself and not being seduced by glamour, status, money. The importance of knowing when to focus on career and when to focus on relationships, and the necessity of finding that balance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both arrogant and insecure, fashionistas lie and betray one another; lead character loses but regains her moral compass.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Girl hit by taxi flies over hood to the street, ends up in hospital with bruised face and broken leg.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some sexual allusions (\"I can think of something we can do that doesn't require any clothing\"); Andi has sex with a writer on their first date (after admitting she's drunk), then regrets it.\n|Language|: Occasional profanity: \"S--t,\" \"A--holes.\" Some references made to sex.\n|Products & Purchases|: All about high fashion (names dropped and shown include Prada, Pucci, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Bill Blass, Chlo\u00e9, Marc Jacobs); plot-pointed references to Starbucks.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Social drinking at parties and restaurants; Andi drinks wine at home and gets tipsy on a date.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768357228e5001f1de712": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dinosaur", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dinosaur is a Disney film set in prehistoric times that is filled with battles to the death, vicious predators, and heroes frequently in danger from both nature and enemy species. The filmmakers use spooky music, very dark settings, and ferocious roars to heighten the intensity. Alternating with survival-of-the-fittest sequences are ones set in a world of beauty and accessibility featuring warmhearted dinosaur heroes and comic, loving lemurs. It's an odd combination of scary and likeable -- not for very young or easily frightened kids.\n|Educational Value|: The natural habitat and different species of dinosaurs are beautifully rendered. The film also reproduces many physical phenomena: landslides, meteor showers, animal migration, and prehistoric creatures' fight to survive.\n|Positive Messages|: Heartily encourages teamwork and standing together to accomplish goals. The survivors are those who refuse to give up and decide to fight for their lives. Also promotes helping the less fortunate even when it's risky. Great leaders are those who truly care about the welfare of their followers.\n|Positive Role Models|: The film's dinosaur-hero is loyal, generous, and very brave; he clearly shows a willingness to risk his own life to help the less fortunate. The audience roots for dinosaurs of multiple species who band together against a common enemy. Some of the prehistoric creatures speak with Southern and African-American dialects. Characters demonstrate teamwork and integrity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Landslides, meteorites, a tsunami, a cave collapse, fire, and enemies all threaten the heroic dinosaurs. The carnotaurus (carnotaur) is the main predator -- often shown in attack mode, close-up, toothy, and viciously roaring. There are many brutal one-on-one fights (and some kills) between mega-strong dinosaurs. The main, humanized characters, whom the audience has grown to like, are often in great danger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lemurs comically prep to meet potential mates.

The movie's aliens aren't cute or appealing in any way -- they're scary-looking, insectoid creations with complex biologies and lives. Expect constant strong language (especially \"f--k\"), as well as some drinking, smoking, and discussion of sex.\n|Positive Messages|: Although it takes place in a sci-fi context, the movie offers a fascinating perspective on South Africa's struggle with apartheid -- and on any nation's struggle with immigration and fear of \"the other.\" The realization that the filmmakers didn't have to build the slums that their disenfranchised alien immigrants live in should also offer pause for thought.\n|Positive Role Models|: The movie ultimately culminates with two beings -- one human, one alien -- working together in the service of the common good and struggling to do the right thing at great personal cost and danger. A lot of painful, upsetting stuff happens to them and others along the way, of course.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Constant, bloody, and brutal violence, some of it involving humans and some involving humanoid, insect-like aliens. Kicking, fighting, severed limbs. Torture, including a man being jabbed with cattle prod so that his hand will pull the trigger of a gun. Characters use high-tech sci-fi firearms, some of which strike with such force that they liquefy their victims. Alien weapons are tested on living beings. Scary medical experimentation imagery, including bloody, explicit body modifications as a man has his DNA rewritten by an alien virus.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some discussion of prostitution and exotic venereal diseases in connection with talk about human/alien interspecies sex.\n|Language|: Lots of harsh/strong language, including \"f--k\" used near constantly, as well as \"bastard,\" \"oh my God,\" \"balls,\" \"crap,\" and more.

In an early scene, the young hero sees his father killed in a car accident; later, he must explore a scary house in order to save his mother from a serial killer. There's also punching, stabbing, beating, strangling, and neck-breaking, as well as images of human and animal corpses in various states of decay. The main character catches glimpses of sexual activity through his binoculars -- a couple through a window, young boys watching porn on TV (breasts are visible), a teen girl getting undressed, etc.. Language includes frequent uses of \"s--t,\" plus other profanity.\n|Positive Messages|: A traumatized boy punches his teacher. During house arrest, he spies on his neighbors; one is a serial murderer. A cop behaves unprofessionally. Mocking characterization of geeky \"Asian\" best friend.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Pushes the edge on PG-13 violence: Images include a harrowing car crash (son sees father killed), a boy punching his teacher in the face, a man using a knife to take off a woman's bra, fast-cut/close-up video camera footage suggesting Ronnie is being attacked, decaying dead bodies, a grisly deer head in a plastic bag, and human skulls and bones stored in a serial killer's house. Also, the hero breaks into a house with a bat and attacks the villain with garden shears (scenes are quite bloody), and the villain menaces a girl in her car, breaks a victim's neck, attacks another with a knife, and tapes and ties up a woman.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Repeated images of Ashley in underwear and bikini (boys watch her with binoculars); off-screen moaning sounds suggest Kale is masturbating (but he's really itching under his security ankle bracelet); young boys watch porn on TV (breasts visible); Kale refers to neighbor as \"Betty Big Bangs\" and watches sexual activities (kissing, undressing) through neighbors' windows; phrases include \"growing bone,\" and \"horny as s--t\" open-mouthed kissing between hero and girlfriend; cell phone ring tone is \"Me So Horny.\"\n|Language|: Repeated uses of \"s--t\" (some with \"bull\"), in addition to other language -- \"ass,\" \"jackass,\" \"d--k-hater,\" \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" \"Jesus!,\" \"sucks\" -- and phrases (\"What a retard!\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Visual and verbal references to iTunes, XBox, Skippy peanut butter, Hershey's chocolate syrup, HDNet, Red Bull, Mac powerbook, Us Weekly, iPod, Twinkies, OxyClean and Cascade detergents, Mayflower movers, Mustang car, Barnes &amp; Noble, and band names (Afroman, Ramones, Led Zeppelin).

Set in a future Chicago, the movie is slightly less violent than the book but still depicts the brutal world of a post-apocalyptic society divided into factions or groups. People are killed, orphaned, injured, and thoroughly beat up in bloody hand-to-hand combat (including guy-on-girl fist fights), violent bullying, an armed occupation, and mass killings of unarmed people. There's a central romance, but it remains fairly chaste -- only some longing looks, embraces and one extended, passionate kiss. The movie features a brave, vulnerable, and fierce female main character.\n|Positive Messages|: The lead character deals with important issues about identity and finding her place in a controlling society. Tris and Four struggle with what it really means to be selfless, brave, smart, and kind, as they explore trusting their own beliefs rather than those imposed by the separatist government.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tris sometimes doubts herself but taps into her courage and ingrained selflessness to protect others even when she doesn't realize it, like when she stands up for Al and takes a punishment for him. Four encourages Tris to use her upbringing's focus on selflessness to be even more courageous. Tris and Four offer a positive example of a teen relationship; they treat each other as equals, defend and protect each other, and go slow with their romance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There is a less violence in the movie than in the book, but it's still a violent story. Several characters are shot at, injured, or killed including beloved parents. Teen siblings are orphaned by the end of the movie. The Dauntless faction of brave risk takers requires a brutal initiation that includes several scenes of bloody hand-to-hand combat (until someone can't get up any more), knife-throwing, marksmanship, and more. Characters are routinely sparring and injuring one another -- or entering fear simulations to deal with their greatest fears, whether it's wild animals, confined spaces, drowning, etc. A character commits suicide and his dead body is briefly shown. Three masked guys grab Tris, beat her up and nearly throw her to her death. Christina is forced to hang off of a ledge for a certain amount of time to atone for her cowardice. During a climactic sequence, drugged soldiers shoot and kill unarmed citizens.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In addition to a few longing looks, just one long passionate kiss (with the guy shirtless), and some heartfelt embraces. During a fear simulation, Tris imagines Four kissing her on a bed and trying to convince her to have sex before she's ready, but she defends herself.\n|Language|: A couple of uses of \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\"  and \"a--hole.\" Other insults include \"Stiff,\" \"coward,\" \"stupid,\" \"loudmouth.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene it looks like some of the Dauntless are drinking, but it's not clear.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776abc594b2b001e6c4649": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-divergent-series-insurgent", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Insurgent is the second installment in the Divergent trilogy. Based on the best-selling dystopian books by Veronica Roth, Insurgent continues the story of heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her love, Four (Theo James). Like the first movie, Insurgent is less violent than the book, but there's still mass shootings of mind-control trackers, execution-style murders, torture, and a fake death. Language includes one quickly uttered \"f--k\" and a couple uses of \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" and \"bitch,\" but it's not frequent. Tris and Four's romance heats up in this installment -- far beyond what's described in the source book. One scene suggests that they've slept together, but nothing is visible beyond bare backs, shoulders, and kissing. The movie stays true to portraying Tris as a brave, headstrong, selfless protagonist who doesn't just let her boyfriend fight her battles.\n|Positive Messages|: Tris deals with important issues about identity and figuring out what it means to be selfless, courageous, smart, and kind as she makes decisions she thinks will help others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tris is a smart, courageous heroine, but she's also occasionally stubborn and hot-headed and can't see the big picture. Four can't help but want to protect Tris, even though he knows she can fight her own battles. Tris and Four offer a positive example of a teen relationship; they treat each other as equals, defend and protect each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters die from execution-style murders, committing suicide under mind control, being tortured/forced to do something dangerous, and from being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lots of weapons and arrests and tank-like vehicles. Some blood, and a pervasive sense of peril/danger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Tris and Four embrace and kiss several times. In one scene, kissing turns into more, and she takes off her top and then his shirt. The scene fades to black, but the next shot is of them in bed, bare shouldered under the sheets. It's implied they had sex and slept in the same bed.\n|Language|: One quickly uttered \"f--k,\" plus a couple of uses of \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" and \"a--hole.\" Other insults include \"stiff,\" \"coward,\" \"psychopath,\" \"loser,\" and \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768adebdf2200209c5d46": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/django-unchained", "cs_age": 18, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 18+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Django Unchained comes from writer/director Quentin Tarantino, and if you've seen any of his other films, you know what that means: incredibly strong, shocking \"grindhouse\" violence and language. Django Unchained (which takes place in Deep South in the mid-1800s) not only features guns, shooting, killing, and spurting blood, but also horrible violence against slaves. Male slaves are forced to fight each other, breaking bones and bashing each other into a bloody pulp. A female slave is briefly tortured, and a male slave is ripped apart by dogs. The \"N\" word is used countless times, as are other Tarantino favorites (\"f--k,\" etc.). There's some partial nudity (both male and female) and kissing, as well as some cigarette smoking and background drinking. The good news is that this movie takes a matter-of-fact look at slavery, which may get discussions going among older teens and families. But otherwise, this movie is very brutal and not recommended for the under-18 set.\n|Positive Messages|: On the one hand, Django Unchained looks at slavery in a matter-of-fact way -- in a way that many other American movies have avoided -- and it could get discussion going about that part of American history. But on the other hand, the movie is largely about killing and revenge, with no real redemption or lessons learned.\n|Positive Role Models|: Django Unchained is populated mainly by killers and scoundrels, people who are hateful and seeking revenge or are looking out for their own interests. One character agrees to help another out of what seems to be friendship, but this small act is more or less lost in the grand scheme of brutality.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In addition to explosive shootouts and killings with massive quantities of spurting blood, the movie shows shocking mistreatments of slaves; male slaves are forced to fight one another, breaking bones and bashing each other to a bloody pulp, and a female slave is tortured in a \"hot box\" for several days. A slave is ripped apart by dogs while people watch. A man is murdered in front of his young son. Slaves are branded.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Partial nudity includes one female breast and two naked men (not full frontal, though nudity is definitely suggested). Django and his wife share a passionate kiss in one scene. There's a good deal of flirting and sexual tension and some innuendo (such as a reference to \"comfort girls\").\n|Language|: Very strong language throughout includes nonstop use of the \"N\" word; possibly the most ever used in a high-profile film. Other words include \"f--k,\" \"motherf---er,\" \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"t-ts,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"bastard,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters smoke cigarettes in a background way.

Because many of the jokes include toilet humor and crude references to the human body, parents may want to decide whether or not they feel comfortable with this type of content for younger kids, though those children will certainly be charmed by the animal characters. Older kids will enjoy the jokes, but parents may still wish to exercise discretion, due to the nature of the humor and some language (\"ass,\" and one use of \"s--t\").\n|Positive Messages|: The message (\"be who you are and love who you are\") is lost amid the crude humor.\n|Positive Role Models|: In some scenes, Dolittle is unkind to animals. He shouts at a dog and briefly ignores the animals' pleas for medical attention.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The rat characters keep goading each other into a fist fight. A rat nearly dies on the operating table. A woman with an allergic reaction to shellfish visits Dolittle's office with horrifically puffed-up eyes (her bruised buttocks also featured).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Much of the film contains mildly raunchy material, including double entendres and sexual innuendo -- expect jokes about a thermometer going into a dog's rear end, and a pigeon preferring \"orange breasts.\"\n|Language|: At one point Dolittle quickly utters \"s--t,\" and there are many almost-curses that are cut off.

Violence is quite intense: Children are shown in peril, screaming, and dying, and there are guns and shooting, fighting and punching, an ax fight, bloody wounds, gore, a sexual predator, and more. The naked ghost of an elderly woman is seen, a man wakes up naked in bed with a woman (his buttocks are shown, and she's shown from the side), and characters kiss. Language includes uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t, \"bitch,\" and more. The main character (Ewan McGregor) is an alcoholic who drinks, passes out, wakes up in unfamiliar places, and vomits. He eventually goes to AA meetings and quits. He also smokes cigarettes, and another character snorts cocaine. Directed by Mike Flanagan, the film can't compare to Stanley Kubrick's original, but, despite the upsetting violence toward kids, it's a well-made, involving sequel for mature viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: In a pretty simple case of good versus evil, characters risk their lives to face difficult odds.\n|Positive Role Models|: Danny starts out as an alcoholic who fights with people, sleeps with random partners, wakes up in strange places, etc. But because Billy goes out of his way to help, Danny gets a job helping others, joins AA, and -- eventually -- risks his life to help little Abra. He even sacrifices himself to save her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Children in peril, screaming in panic/pain, children killed. Death.

At the start, the main character (Benedict Cumberbatch) is arrogant and selfish, but he slowly learns humility: to better himself and to think of others. Frequent comic book-style action violence includes large-scale destruction, a brutal car crash (the result of texting and driving), bloody wounds and scenes at an operating table, and a terrible fall from a height, crashing through glass. There's also martial arts fighting, fighting with \"magical\" weapons, a beheading, and other brief, scary stuff. A couple is said to have been in a relationship, and there's a mention of \"sleeping together.\" Language includes one \"s--t,\" two uses of \"a--hole\" and an \"ass.\" The doctor is an unusual, but very entertaining, member of the superhero club, and the movie's mystical elements provide food for thought as well as fun.\n|Positive Messages|: The ultimate lesson is one of humility -- i.e. \"It's not about you.\" Arrogance and selfishness are limited, unfulfilling paths; learning to better yourself and following a path that isn't always easy provide greater rewards. Perseverance pays off. But rather than fight against a current, it can sometimes be better to surrender and use the current's power to your benefit. Argues that sometimes breaking the rules a little is necessary to get a job done. (And don't text and drive!)\n|Positive Role Models|: As Marvel heroes go, Doctor Strange is closer to Tony Stark/Iron Man than he is to Steve Rogers/Captain America. He starts the story as arrogant and afraid but slowly learns humility -- to see a greater good outside his own wants and needs. He enters the battle even though he doesn't want to and even though he hasn't yet mastered his powers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of mass destruction of buildings and property. A beheading (no gore shown). Frequent martial arts fighting, with some \"magical\" weapons (swords and whips made of light). Scenes on an operating table, with some bloody parts shown. Bloody scratches on the main character's face. Brutal car crash (character was texting while driving), with bloody hands and face. A terrible fall from a height, crashing through glass. Arguing. Some scary sequences (a brief nightmarish \"journey\" with grabbing hands).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters have had an intimate relationship, and they talk comfortably together.

Strange asks fellow Avenger/WandaVision troublemaker Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) for her help across various timelines. Like the other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has lots of comic book-style fighting and peril -- as well as themes of courage and teamwork -- but, thanks to director Sam Raimi, it's a much darker, more horror-based adventure than the typical MCU film. Expect jump scares, a resurrected dead body, violent deaths, graphic depictions of a decomposing body, and fatal fight scenes that decimate entire villages and have a high body count. People burn to death and are shown turning into ash, and characters explode, are crushed, seem to fall to their deaths, are impaled, have their necks snapped, and much more. There's no sex and barely any romance, although in a couple of scenes two characters embrace, hold hands, and stare longingly at each other. Language is occasionally salty, including some uses of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" etc.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages compassion, empathy, perseverance, teamwork, even when it seems that all is lost, that defeat is inevitable. Movie, like others in MCU, is about balancing superhero responsibility with personal happiness, understanding that everyone needs help, and the idea that friends don't betray one another. Overriding message about ethical issue involved in sacrificing one person for the so-called \"greater good.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters act bravely, selflessly, with compassion and empathy for individuals and the greater good. America is courageous, curious, kind. Stephen is still brilliant but also a tad more humble, able to admit his past mistakes and ask for forgiveness. He helps America despite the personal costs. On the downside, a character's selfish desires override their ability to empathize or fully understand the chaos and destruction they're creating.\n|Diverse Representations|: Supporting characters are from various racial/ethnic backgrounds: America Chavez is cued as Latina, even though she's not from Earth; Wong is East Asian; Mordo is Black; Wanda and Christine are White. Incidental LGBTQ+ representation in a memory of America's: She has two moms. Sexist stereotypes about women not being able to think clearly when it comes to their children: Wanda is portrayed with motherhood as her sole motivation, which leads to her acting irrationally, with no concern for others' cost or suffering.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few jump scares involve a villain's ability to defeat basically everyone, as well as creatures that do the villain's bidding. A fight destroys a space, as well as many of the people within it, some of whom are burned to death (down to ash). A body is resurrected and controlled from beyond the grave. High body count, with significant characters being injured or killed. Demonic beings try to kill a resurrected body. A giant monster has its eyeball pulled out.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Shot of Doctor Strange shirtless. Two characters have had an intimate relationship and discuss how they've loved each other in many timelines. Longing looks, hand holding. In a memory, America sees her moms being affectionate.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"stupid,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Not much on-screen, but as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there are lots of off-screen tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Doctor Strange drinks a few martinis at a wedding reception where other adults also drink champagne, wine, cocktails.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e16333f188587003d049ef5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dog", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dog is a buddy road-trip dramedy about a U.S. Army veteran named Briggs (Channing Tatum) who must transport a Belgian Malinois named Lulu -- a fellow soldier's K-9 military working dog -- to her late handler's funeral across the country. Expect a fair bit of strong language (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" etc.), as well as suggestive references and one scene that shows the early moments (consent, embracing, Briggs' shirt coming off) of a potential threesome that gets interrupted. There are allusions to a death by suicide, war, and war wounds (the main character had a traumatic brain injury). Two potentially controversial plot points to consider: Briggs pretends to be a blind veteran with a guide dog to score a free room at a hotel, and the dog, Lulu, attacks a Muslim hotel guest because of his apparel. Both incidents do have consequences, but the impersonation of a blind man is somewhat played for laughs. On the upside, it encourages compassion, empathy, and perseverance and could spark conversations about mental health in the military community, both for humans and war dogs.\n|Positive Messages|: Some iffy behavior/choices, but ultimately encourages compassion, empathy, perseverance. The bond between dog and human is explored at length. Idea that pets bring out the best in humans and vice versa (with patience and consistent love) is a main theme. Promotes acts of service, kindness, togetherness. Importance of mental health in military community is an underlying message.\n|Positive Role Models|: Briggs redeems himself by movie's end, but for part of it, he's selfish and motivated only by getting a particular job, not admitting he needs help. He's not loving or patient with Lulu until he sees how she reacts to others who are better around animals. He's initially quick to anger and fairly volatile but grows into a more understanding and empathetic man.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Only a few briefly shown characters are BIPOC. The sole acknowledgment of race/ethnicity takes place when Lulu attacks a hijabi doctor, excused by the film as a byproduct of Lulu's prior deployment in Afghanistan. Briggs pretends to be a blind veteran with Lulu as his guide dog to secure a free night's stay at a hotel. The \"joke\" or \"twist\" that a character pretends to have a disability in order to trick others and/or get freebies is a longstanding Hollywood cliche that damages the credibility of real people who have real accessibility needs. In the film there are consequences, but it's played for laughs.\n|Violence & Scariness|: References to war and death by suicide. Briggs deals with visible pain on several occasions. A person breaks a car window to let a dog out. A military-trained dog attacks a Muslim man because he looks like previous targets. The attack forces another man to push through other guests to get to his dog. For most of the movie, it's presumed that Lulu will be put to sleep. (Spoiler alert: She is not.) Two people shove and yell at each other. One character shoots another with a tranquilizer gun and then keeps him tied up. A character wields an ax in a threatening way.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Briggs flirts with many women at a bar and a hotel. He meets two women who ask him back to their place, where they proposition him with a threesome. It doesn't go further than him taking his shirt off and embracing them both because Lulu's barking interrupts them, but it's implied that it would have been \"an epic threesome.\" Nonsexual shirtlessness when Briggs gives Lulu a bath.\n|Language|: Frequent use of \"s--t\" and \"bulls--t,\" with lesser uses of \"a--hole,\" \"butthole,\" \"ass,\" and \"bitch,\" as well as insults like \"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" \"liar,\" \"working class,\" and the racial slur \"raghead.\" Briggs flips off a police officer who was rude to him and made racist comments.\n|Products & Purchases|: A few glimpses of car brands, but no overt product placement.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Briggs drinks a lot, mostly at bars and restaurants but also by himself. He mostly drinks beer but also straight from a liquor bottle. He stumbles upon a couple's backyard cannabis garden and later eats one of their homemade edibles (a lollipop). Briggs sedates Lulu so that she'll stop barking and go to sleep. He seems to self-medicate with alcohol without officially having a dependency.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d3396b655001fe426c8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dolittle", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dolittle is a kid-friendly adventure comedy starring Robert Downey, Jr. as a doctor who can communicate with animals. It diverges from author Hugh Lofting's original book, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle (as well as previous movie adaptations from 1967 and 1998) into its own story. Here, Doolittle is a hermit following the death of his wife, who was a brave explorer. While the overall story is told in the spirit of fun and adventure, the movie deals with themes of loss and abandonment, overcoming grief through helping others, and finding a family among friends. While communication, compassion, and teamwork are all on display, there's also more violence and peril than you might expect in a family film -- including knives, cannons, guns, poison, and animal attacks -- but much of it feels cartoonish. A hunting accident plays out with an anti-gun sentiment: A warm-hearted human character accidentally shoots a (hilariously dramatic) squirrel and then sets out to save its life. While there's some gently rude humor, like animal bottoms and farts, parents may be most shocked by a scene in which the doctor appears to unblock a creature's intestinal tract through its anus (gratefully, not on camera). One use of \"damn.\"\n|Educational Value|: Many kids will take to the idea of being a veterinarian, although the veterinary science here is pretty iffy.\n|Positive Messages|: It's only by helping others that we can truly help ourselves. Treat animals well, and they will treat you well. Themes touch on loss and abandonment, overcoming grief through helping others, and finding a family among friends. Promotes communication, compassion, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dr. Dolittle and his apprentice, Tommy Stubbins, demonstrate compassion and kindness to animals; the animals, in turn, support them similarly. When an enemy gains a greater understanding of Dolittle's behavior, he shows him compassion as well. Lily Dolittle was a smart, brave woman who embraced adventure, something the men in her life admire.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hunters shoot at ducks, and one accidentally shoots a squirrel (who's saved). In separate instances, a human is attacked by a tiger and bats. Soldiers point their guns at a boy. A villain holds a knife to his enemy's face. A cannonball is fired at a boat full of animals, who must quickly escape into the water and struggle to survive. A teen demonstrates dangerous actions when he jumps from a very high bridge onto a passing ship. A frightening creature threatens humans.

Guns are fired many times, with characters either wounded or killed. Blood splatters are shown. There's also fighting, punching, pummeling, and beating with blunt objects.

Violence is brutally intense, with gushing, spraying blood, many deaths and dead bodies, guns and shooting, stabbing and slicing, lots of fighting, bashing with hard objects, choking, etc. A child is in intense peril -- she's injured and nearly dies -- for almost the whole movie.

(The term \"cook\" is used.) Characters kiss. The movie has some deft, clever sequences, but its downsides sink it.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie doesn't seem to be about much of anything other than violence, and, in the end, the survivors don't seem to have been affected one way or another by all of it.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Norman/Blind Man character has been recast as the supposed hero here, but even though he's fighting difficult odds to try to save a child, his attacks are brutal, and he sustains some very painful damage. In the end, he confesses to being a killer and a rapist, and he makes the hard choice to not allow Phoenix to come back to him.\n|Diverse Representations|: No real diversity here. Some of the villain's crew appear to be people of color, but they're not very important to the story. Phoenix is a fairly strong-willed and skilled young girl; for a time she's able to save herself from the invaders, but then she needs rescuing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Child in almost constant peril; she falls down a flight of stairs, injuring her head.

The destruction here is massive but exaggerated, though teens who grasp the underlying environmental themes may well be frightened at the peril. There's also a death, but it's purposely ridiculous. Drugs are smoked, popped, and referenced, and one character smokes cigarettes regularly. There's full-frontal nudity in a nonsexual context, as well as a close-up of breasts during sex.

It shows the close friendship between Daisy (Jessica Tandy), a White Jewish woman in her 70s, and Hoke (Morgan Freeman), the Black man employed as her driver. While on a road trip, a trooper refers to them using the \"N\" word and \"old Jew woman.\" Daisy's synagogue is bombed (not shown), which reminds Hoke of the aftermath of a lynching he witnessed as a young boy in rural Georgia, in which he found his friend's father hanging from a tree. The movie avoids overtly denouncing racism, preferring to hint at systemic injustice: For instance, while Daisy's son, a successful businessman, \"supports\" the message of Martin Luther King Jr., he's worried that public calls for civil rights would, as a Jewish White man in the South, cost him his business relationships. Daisy similarly doesn't consider herself racist, hotly reminding Hoke that she grew up poor. But she indulges in prejudiced behavior, such as not inviting Hoke to a speech she attends given by Dr. King until Hoke is driving her to the venue. She also falsely accuses Hoke of stealing from her pantry; as she tells her son, \"they all take things, you know.\" For his part, Hoke admirably threads the needle of using enough deference to keep his job, through frequent \"yes, sir\" and \"yes'm\"s, but also maintains key moments of agency wherein he calls Daisy out for unreasonable demands. The movie takes place among these themes, as well as themes of trying to maintain your independence while aging, but its focus on delivering a feel-good story of two unlikely friends -- paired with an overly simplistic and nostalgic take on systemic injustice -- blunts more meaningful messages.\n|Positive Messages|: The necessity and transformative power of friendship. Grappling with institutional and overt racism, in the case of Hoke; in the case of Daisy, the loss of some independence due to aging.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hoke, a man who grew up in rural Georgia during the Jim Crow-era South, finds ways to assert himself within the strict confines of racist society. Daisy sometimes condescends to Hoke and others, but she is a fiercely independent woman who doesn't relinquish the loss of this independence due to aging without fighting it every step of the way.\n|Diverse Representations|: Black characters are portrayed in a way based in stereotype, appearing to be happy (or at least indifferent) working for White employers in roles such as drivers, housekeepers, and cooks. A Black character's death is treated matter of factly, and it's used as a plot point. On racial representation alone, the film generally fails. However, Hoke does assert himself and avoids becoming a caricature. And a character who is Jewish, over age 70 with dementia, has a more nuanced portrayal.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mild car crash and mention of a synagogue being bombed. Hoke shares a memory with Daisy about seeing his friend's father hanging from a tree when he was a boy.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Infrequent profanity.

Much of the comedy is inappropriate for younger viewers -- Fred smearing dog excrement on a spotless white rug, or Fred picking his nose and wiping it on others' faces, for instance -- but overall, despite these scenes and some of the language and sexual content (Fred looking up skirts, a bare male bottom), this is a charmingly dated slice of early '90s silliness that could resonate for teens and adults who had imaginary friends when they were younger.\n|Positive Messages|: In its own way, this movie shows the importance of having an active imagination, in childhood and beyond.\n|Positive Role Models|: While the film definitely encourages a whole slew of bad behaviors, Elizabeth does learn to accept who she is, and to stand up to those who have been mean to her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence involving an imaginary friend who engages in numerous instances of slapstick pratfalls.

There's also some exploration of the way that fathers influence sons and how sons can either follow in their father's footsteps or forge their own way.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though he does undergo a transformation in the end, Peter has a quick temper, which sometimes leads him to lash out verbally and physically.

Teen characters drink, fool around, talk about sex, and swear (including \"d--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" and one \"f--k\"), and the humor and references can be crude (boys talk about \"banging\" girls, etc.). There's also a cruel incident of cyberbullying and lots of product placement. Stereotypes typical of high school movies are somewhat upended (some popular characters are kind and sensitive, etc.), and the main character learns that it's important to define yourself rather than letting others label you, but there's also an underlying theme about having to change who you are to succeed in romance.\n|Positive Messages|: Nobody has the right to label you; you get to define yourself. And it's not healthy or productive to compare yourself to others. But there's also an underlying theme about needing to change who you are in order to get the object of your affection to notice (and have sex with) you, and appearance is definitely part of the equation. The whole concept of DUFFs (designated ugly fat friends) is cruel, but that's alleviated by the movie's ultimately uplifting tone.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bianca is interesting and straightforward, and when she gets knocked down, she's resilient enough to pick herself up and keep going. Wesley is coarse at times, but he's a sweetheart. Bianca's friends might be popular and attractive, but they're also good hearted and loyal. The movie plays with some of the typical stereotyping of high school movies (i.e. popular girls can be writers and hackers, and a football player can be kind and sensitive), but some characters are still pretty broadly defined. Parents are also depicted as caricatures.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some shouting matches, plus cyberbullying: A vindictive girl makes a compromising video about a classmate go viral just to hurt her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sex-related themes permeate the movie. Crude jokes/references right off the bat include talk about what boys would like to do to girls (\"banging,\" etc.).

On the one hand, critics claim the crows are animated minstrel parodies, while Disney apologists say the crows are the only likeable characters besides Dumbo, his mom, and Timothy the mouse. If you're OK with the representation of the crows, there are still a couple of disturbing scenes, particularly when Mrs. Jumbo is captured after defending Dumbo. Plus, Dumbo and Timothy accidentally get drunk and hallucinate the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" segment, that's alternately trippy, creepy, and cute. Overall, the message is that we should celebrate and not mock each other's differences.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn how hurtful bullying can be, and they'll be reminded not to make fun of people because of their differences.\n|Positive Messages|: Includes important messages for kids, particularly about how it's wrong to make fun of someone because of the way they look. Our differences are what make us special, the mouse teaches Dumbo. Mrs. Jumbo's actions prove a mother's love is unconditional, and she'll defend you no matter what. Themes include courage and empathy. On the downside, there are dated cultural stereotypes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ongoing controversy about the depiction of the crows. Originally one was called \"Jim Crow\" in the script, and they're all voiced with outdated, racist speech patterns. Others claim the crows were all confident, free, and the only characters besides Timothy who are sympathetic to Dumbo. Timothy is supportive and encouraging from the first time he meets Dumbo, and Mrs. Jumbo is a loving, protective mother. Dumbo himself doesn't speak, but he manages to overcome his insecurity to fly at the crucial moment. The gossipy elephants make fun of baby Jumbo and call him \"Dumbo\"; later they also take pleasure in Mrs. Jumbo's solitary confinement. The kids at the circus poke fun at Dumbo's ears.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mean kids at the circus pull on Dumbo's ears, so his mother spanks a boy's bottom with her trunk. As punishment, she's tied and chained and understandably tries to free herself -- throwing various circus workers around as a consequence. She's kept imprisoned in solitary confinement and branded a \"mad elephant,\" leaving poor Dumbo friendless and alone. Dumbo's catastrophic circus act leads to the entire circus top coming down; he's briefly shown in peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Dumbo (and other animal babies) is delivered via stork instead of through a live birth, so some young children may wonder about that.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie itself, but many offline merchandising tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The clowns, who are shown in silhouette, are obviously drinking.

While drunk, Dumbo has an elaborate (and creepy to some kids) hallucination with the infamously trippy \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b84ad5437001f7a1f95": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dumbo-0", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dumbo is director Tim Burton's live-action take on Disney's 1941 animated classic about everyone's favorite flying elephant. This version -- which stars Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, and Danny DeVito -- keeps the original's spirit while expanding on its storyline and kicking things up in the scariness department thanks to Burton's signature intensity. The movie's vibrant, colorful world is peppered with dark, creepy sequences/elements, including a cruel animal handler, a character who's crushed to death by a collapsing circus tent, armed henchmen who pursue both animals and children, characters in peril/falling from heights, and an amusement park attraction that's aptly named Nightmare Island. There are also some very sad parts, like when Mrs. Jumbo is separated from baby Dumbo, which might prove upsetting for younger/more sensitive viewers and foster and/or adoptive families. Characters also discuss loss (the main kid characters' mom died from influenza). Language is minimal (\"hell\" and one incomplete \"s--t\" are about it), and this version of the film thankfully doesn't have the racially stereotyped crow characters or a drunk, hallucinating Dumbo. And it has themes of teamwork, compassion, and empathy and promotes the idea that our differences help make us special.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn a bit about early circus acts and how they functioned, as well as lessons in honesty, teamwork, compassion.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages focus on right and wrong way to treat animals, how no one should ridicule others because of their appearance, how communities work together to help one another. Promotes idea that our differences help make us special. Children can have a big impact. A mother's love is absolutely unconditional, but the story also uses the idea of Dumbo being able to earn his mother back by doing well -- which could be upsetting for kids/families who've dealt with separation (through adoption, foster care, etc.). Kids don't have to have same dreams and goals as their parents. Themes also include teamwork, empathy, compassion. One \"throwaway\" line seems to poke fun at emotional overeating.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mrs. Jumbo is a loving, protective mother. Dumbo doesn't speak, but he learns to fly and communicate with the kids. Milly and Joe are kind, patient animal lovers; Milly dreams of being a scientist. Holt is slightly clueless about how to parent at first but loves his kids, keeps them safe -- and learns more about how to relate to them along the way. Colette remembers what it's like to be valued for who she is, rather than what she looks like and can do. Max's circus is made up of people with many unusual talents; ultimately, their special skills are all important. Max typically means well but is a bit selfish -- but it's nothing compared to Mr. Vandevere, who's epitome of valuing profit over people. Some diversity among cast, including within Farrier family.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several disturbing/upsetting/scary scenes. Cruel animal handler threatens, punches Mrs. Jumbo; Holt hits him. Unsympathetic character crushed to death in tent collapse (body shown being carried out under drape). Mrs. Jumbo goes a bit wild trying to protect/defend Dumbo, causes chaos/panic and damage; she's separated from Dumbo in particularly sad sequence (and he's often sad during ensuing time apart). Mrs. Jumbo is chained up. During performance, Dumbo, surrounded by fire, looks like he's going to fall to injury or death but ultimately flies. Milly, Colette, Holt all fall/slip from heights in other scenes but end up OK. Someone orders Mrs. Jumbo killed. Men with guns pursue Farrier family (including kids); one man knocks a child down. Farrier family is stuck in circus ring surrounded by fire. Flames and destruction. Dreamland attraction \"Nightmare Island\" is dark and creepy, with scary noises, animals (bear, alligator, \"werewolf,\" etc.) on display. References to Holt's wife/the children's mother's death from influenza; they all miss, mourn her. Holt lost an arm in the war (WWI). During a performance, a gun is used to pop a balloon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of longing looks and a kiss between an adult couple.\n|Language|: A couple uses of \"hell\" and one incomplete \"s--t,\" plus \"heck,\" \"son of a gun,\" \"scalawag,\" \"freak.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing on camera, but Disney has a lot of merchandise both through partnerships and their own brands: plush figures, apparel, toys, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters toast good news with champagne.

It covers the first half of the book and stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya. Sci-fi action violence includes lots of fighting, both on the battlefield and one on one, with guns, knives, and other weapons. There are also beheadings and explosions, and characters are stabbed and/or cut open, poisoned, and eaten by worms. A little bit of blood is shown, and characters die. There's kissing and partial male nudity (no sensitive body parts shown). Infrequent language includes \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and \"hell.\" The story is about a drug known as \"spice,\" but it's more of a thing for everyone to fight over than a real drug. While this (long) movie isn't without its flaws, director Denis Villeneuve gives it a languid smoothness that makes for an enthralling tale.\n|Positive Messages|: This film covers the first half of the source novel, so many of the book's bigger themes -- including religion and environmentalism -- aren't fully explored. One theme that does arise involves control of Arrakis: The villains (House Harkonnen) oppress the Fremen, while the heroes (House Atreides) try to work alongside them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Paul comes off as a fairly traditional hero but also has started down a dark path by beginning to use a prophecy to his own advantage, setting himself up as a kind of messiah. To prove himself worthy of the Fremen, he kills a man; there are no consequences. His father, Duke Leto, is a far better role model; he's shown to be kind, benevolent, wise, understanding, although his trust and loyalty eventually (spoiler alert) get him killed.\n|Diverse Representations|: Male-driven narrative, but women in supporting roles are quite powerful and admirable. This version improves on previous iterations' all-White casts by including diverse actors (Latino, Hawaiian/Polynesian, Asian, Black), but main characters are still all White, and (spoiler alert) virtually all characters of color die. Has raised concerns in the way it leans on Middle Eastern culture for world-building but doesn't include any MENA actors. No body/size diversity, unless you count the Baron, whose grotesqueness is unfortunately tied to his larger size and eating.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Sci-fi action-style guns and shooting. People get shot; deaths/dead bodies. Fighting with swords, blades, other weapons. Battles. Explosions. Character stabbed. Character impaled with dart. Neck-slicing. Beheadings. Characters swallowed by sandworm. Not much blood, but scenes include a bloody hand, bloody knife, blood spot. Poison gas. Crash-landing. Rape is mentioned in dialogue.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing. A man appears to be naked; nothing explicit shown. Shirtless man.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of \"hell,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"damn.\" \"My God\" used as an exclamation.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \"Spice\" is described as a drug that has good properties but is also addictive; the only side effect is that it turns users' eyes luminous blue. It's not really depicted as a substance that can be abused. It's more just \"the thing\" that both the heroes and villains want to get their hands on.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c0623d5a3001f516b20": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/dunkirk", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Dunkirk is director Christopher Nolan's World War II movie about the real-life incident in which Allied forces were surrounded and trapped on Dunkirk beach -- and everyday heroes helped rescue them, despite the risk of danger and death. The movie's war violence is realistic and intense, with heavy bombing and shooting and many deaths (though very little blood). Planes crash in the ocean, ships fill with water and sink, and an oil slick catches fire, burning many soldiers. A teen civilian is injured, and a man walks into the ocean, presumably to commit suicide. Language includes two uses of \"f--k\" and one \"Christ\" (as an exclamation), and there's one scene with beer. Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy co-star, but there are many characters, some of whom aren't clearly distinguished from others. That, plus Nolan's time-twisting technique, can make the story challenging to follow. But it has messages of bravery, teamwork, and sacrifice, and persistent teens and adults will be rewarded with a powerful, visceral experience.\n|Positive Messages|: Even though the battle at Dunkirk resulted in many deaths, it also represents a triumph in heroism and courage: countless people worked together, risking their lives to help strangers.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mr. Dawson is perhaps the most recognizable character -- and the one most noted for his bravery and his sacrifices. While most other characters are deliberately stripped down (and, as a result, are somewhat thin), there's no question that many of them exhibit strengths like courage and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Takes place during an intense, terrible WWII battle. Tons of realistic bombing and shooting. Not much blood shown, but countless soldiers die, often drowning or being swept into the sea. Soldiers burn in an oil fire on the water's surface. A teen has a fatal fall and dies. In the distance, a man walks into the ocean, presumably to commit suicide.

Its themes of loyalty, trust, and caring are both affecting and easy to understand, and Elliott and E.T.'s extraordinary friendship is one of cinema's most enduring. Some scenes of peril and danger may be too intense for very young children, and a key character's apparent death will be emotional for just about everyone. Brief strong language includes \"s--t\" and \"son of a bitch,\" as well as an insult that includes \"penis.\" There's a bit of squabbling among siblings, and E.T. and Elliott both get/act tipsy in one comically memorable scene. A newer edition replaced guns with walkie-talkies, though that sparked a fair bit of backlash. The film was also criticized for having a complete absence of non-white characters. But when Elliott's bicycle lifts up into the sky and soars across the moon, all you'll remember is the joy of movie magic done right.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can learn about friendship and trust.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages of friendship, loyalty, trust, and sacrifice, as exemplified by Elliott and E.T.'s unique relationship. Themes include compassion, communication, and empathy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Elliott is loyal and brave, and E.T. is loving and selfless. While Elliott may be keeping E.T.'s existence a secret, he does it to keep his new friend safe and does anything he can to help him. He and his little sister and eventually their brother believe that E.T. is good before anyone else. Characters demonstrate teamwork and perseverance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Most of the violence is from the government agents pursuing E.T. and eventually capturing him. There are several scenes of E.T. and the characters screaming in horror, usually because they have just encountered each other. In one particularly upsetting sequence, E.T. gets ghostly pale and looks like he's about to die or actually has died. In another scene, men try to stop E.T. and the kids from escaping.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Elliott, while under the influence of his connection with E.T. (who is watching a couple kiss in a movie), kisses a young girl in his class.\n|Language|: Brief but strong for young audiences: \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"Oh my God!,\" \"son of a bitch,\" plus insults like \"penis breath,\" \"stupid,\" etc. Passing use of the word \"redskin\" during a reading of Peter Pan.\n|Products & Purchases|: One of the most successful and memorable product placements in movie history: Reese's Pieces. Also, Elliott has Star Wars figures and memorabilia (which is not surprising considering director George Lucas is Spielberg's close pal). Coke, Head and Shoulders shampoo, Coors beer and Pez dispensers are also featured.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: E.T. drinks beer and gets tipsy, which affects Elliott through their special connection.

It centers on a straight-laced teen (Emma Stone) who gets caught up in the school rumor mill (partly thanks to gossip spreading via Facebook and texting) -- a situation that many teens will be able to identify with. Labeled promiscuous after she tells a white lie and, later, exacerbates that lie with another, she quickly loses control of the situation (though, because this is a movie, she manages to cope with poise and wit). Although little action is shown, the subject of sex permeates the whole film, and there are lots of innuendoes/references and situations (including talk about losing virginity), as well as incidents in which kids judge one another. There's also some swearing (including \"s--t\") and allusions to underage drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: In keeping with its connection to Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, the film thumbs its nose at hypocrisy and those who stand in judgment of others. Though it sometimes goes about this noble goal in a ham-handed way -- i.e. by stereotyping certain groups (like Christians and high schoolers in general) -- it does confront important questions about labeling and judging others (especially when your own life isn't perfect).\n|Positive Role Models|: Olive gets an undeserved reputation for being sleazy and fights back by throwing other people's judgments in their face. Instead of submitting to her peers' small-mindedness, she stands up for herself (though she does sometimes go about it in an ill-advised manner). She uses humor to deflect cruelty and has a soft heart. She does bend the truth, sometimes to her detriment -- and she also takes the iffy step of demanding payment (in the form of gift cards) for helping guys with their reputations -- but in the end she finds that honesty really is the best policy. Her parents are both irreverent and supportive, and a young man accepts her for who she is rather than who she's reputed to be.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A teen slaps a peer; another gets into a fight, though viewers don't see the actual skirmish -- just him nursing a bleeding nose. A guy gets pushy trying to kiss a girl.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Though viewers don't actually see anyone having sex, the characters talk about it a lot, and the subject permeates the whole movie. Virginity (and the loss thereof) is a frequent topic of discussion. High schoolers gossip about a classmate's sex life. A girl and a boy fake having sex behind closed doors by making very loud grunting sounds and talking \"dirty\" to each other. A main character wears suggestive clothing to confront her \"easy\" reputation. A teacher talks about having sex with a student (who's of age). A quick glimpse of the side of a breast (the woman's a nudist). There's a vibrator in the movie, though it's not seen (wrapped in paper). Mention of a sexually transmitted disease.\n|Language|: Language includes several uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"screw,\" \"tw-t,\" \"skank,\" \"d--k,\" \"t-t,\" and \"whore.\" Also \"goddamn\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of logos/mentions of stores/brands, including Costco, Home Depot, Target, Quiznos, T.J. Maxx, Bath &amp; Body Works, and other mall-type stores (most are in the context of gift cards that the main character takes as payment for doing reptuation-related \"favors\" for guys).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A bong is shown briefly.

The swearing, sexuality, and themes make it appropriate for mature high schoolers and up. Frequently used language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"d--khead,\" and more, and the sexual content includes a social media message that lists out graphic things the main character would like to do with -- and to -- her crush. There are also a couple of scenes of teens making out and in bed. One scene briefly appears to border on nonconsensual sex; a girl asks whether a guy wants to have sex, then says she was kidding when he takes her seriously. Teens drink alcohol at parties and at home (no adults are present), sometimes to the point of throwing up. The main character lost her father four years before the movie's events take place. Despite the strong language and underage substance use, the movie actually encourages communication and could open the door for thought-provoking discussions between parents and teens.\n|Positive Messages|: Ultimately promotes communication, perseverance, honesty, and self worth. Nadine's story encourages healthy family relationships through conversation and collaboration; it also encourages friends to be gentle and empathetic with one another. Shows the dangers of careless social media interactions and sexually explicit communication -- and the potential dangers of unsafe sexual activity\n|Positive Role Models|: Nadine struggles for a long time to see her self worth but eventually realizes she's worthy of friendship and love. Mr. Bruner listens patiently to Nadine and offers her help. Darian shows his sister that he really cares about her, and Nadine realizes what a great friend Krista is and that she didn't need to make her brother and girlfriend choose between her and their happiness. Erwin is compassionate and sweet to Nadine.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One scene of teens making out has hints of non-consensual sexual activity, but it subsides quickly. A kid watches her father have a heart attack.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A teen couple is shown in bed together, clearly following a night of sexual activity. They're later shown kissing/making out and going up to a bedroom together. Nadine accidentally sends Nick a sexually explicit message letting him know about her sexual fantasies (that he put his penis inside her and that she give him oral sex, among other things). While in a hot tub, a girl jokingly suggests that she and her male friend get out and have sex, but she's just kidding.\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"f--kers,\" \"f--king,\" \"s--t,\" \"s--tty,\" \"ass,\" \"pr--k,\" \"d--khead,\" \"d--k,\" \"t-ts,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), \"a--hole,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"psycho,\" and insults like \"nobody loves you,\" \"you suck,\" and \"you're going to get AIDS.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands/products seen or mentioned include Petland, Apple, Puma, Honda Civic, Coke, Converse, Lays, Futurama.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Nadine and Krista drink to the point of vomiting and are very drunk.

Not a lot of blood is seen, but many, many characters die -- including the main one, who dies over and over (most frequently via a gun to the head) as he learns how to defeat his enemies. There's also some swearing (including \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and one use of \"f--k\") and kissing.\n|Positive Messages|: It may seem like a cliche, but it's true: If at first you don't succeed, try try try again. Related to that is the message that life can surprise you, even if you think you've seen it all.\n|Positive Role Models|: Major William Cage is tenacious and willing to learn, even if that means confronting his own demons. He does whatever is necessary to save humanity -- including dying every single day. Rita Vrataski is the consummate soldier, willing to put herself on the line for the good of the mission and her colleagues. She's a strong, powerful female character who holds her own in all circumstances. Other characters look up to her as an example.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As a key part of the plot, the main character dies repeatedly, most of the time via a gun to the head. Most of the film is set during loud, intense battle scenes that feature a wide variety of carnage, chaos, and mayhem. A helicopter crash results in a significant death. Constant peril/danger, and many, many people are killed, by bullets, bombs, aliens, catching on fire, being crushed by a plane, and other means, though few of the scenes show anything especially gory or bloody.

Even young kids will appreciate the humor inherent in this fish-out-of-water tale, although some might be upset that Buddy's mother died and that his father never knew about him. The few action sequences (galloping rangers chasing Santa in Central Park, a brief confrontation with a scary raccoon, and some scuffles in a department store) aren't really threatening, and no one is injured. Although the movie is 100% on board with the magic of Christmas, some characters shake their head and roll their eyes at the notion of Santa, and kids talk about the possibility of parents being the ones behind the presents. But the movie's overall message of the value derived from honesty, acceptance, and affection for all humanity is clear and positive. Under the CCPA law you have the right to protect your personal information. Make a Do Not Sell request to ELF.\n|Educational Value|: Kids might learn the words to a few Christmas songs.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie suggests that although people sometimes lose sight of what's important in life, they can find their way back. It also says that the holiday spirit is based on faith believing rather than seeing and that generosity, kindness, and earnestness can win over even the most cynical and humorless individuals. All of that said, some of the film's humor comes from references to bodily functions: pooping, burping, peeing, throwing up.\n|Positive Role Models|: Buddy is cheerful, well-intentioned, creative, and grateful for what he has. He brings laughter and joy to others and is a loyal and giving friend. After a storybook upbringing in Santa's workshop, Buddy brings his unique and trusting nature to New York City. At first an object of ridicule, he later becomes a stellar example to the people he encounters, even the most jaded and self-involved among them. Characters learn and demonstrate curiosity, compassion, gratitude, and integrity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish action in several instances: Santa wrestles with an elf; park rangers look ominous as they chase Santa and his reindeer-driven sleigh on Christmas Eve; Buddy is hit by a taxi but immediately springs up, uninjured; a near attack by a ferocious-looking raccoon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One sweet kiss between main characters. A reference to nakedness in the shower.\n|Language|: Infrequent swearing/potty language includes \"pissed,\" \"pee,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" and \"up yours.\" Comedy at the expense of a little person who is called an elf and takes offense.\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of product placement, including numerous toys in Santa's workshop and the store where Buddy works: Monopoly, Etch-a-Sketch, Lego, etc. Other scenes feature Chanel, Kodak, Clinque, Pop Tarts, Coca-Cola, Tamiflu, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene played for laughs, two important characters add whiskey to coffee and later are shown to be quite drunk.

The film is based on a Norwegian children's television series and is the first Ella Bella feature-length tale. The title character is an exuberant little girl who adores her neighbors (both old and young), her family, her picturesque small town, and most of all, the boy who is her very best friend. This story introduces a new member of the community: a lad who immediately monopolizes Ella's best friend's attention. Being a good friend, coping with jealousy, and accepting others are strong themes. Viewers can expect to see a bull chasing kids, some potentially frightening images (ghosts, skeletons) in an amusement park haunted house, comic falls/crashes, and multiple dog farts. While the movie is intended for younger kids, there are some moments that may be too scary for those who are not yet comfortable with real versus imaginary action.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages being kind, welcoming, and loyal. Promotes friendship and acceptance of others.

It is supposed to be humorous when a character gets tipsy and has a drinking problem. There is violence, including fighting, knives, and swordplay, and there are a couple scary scenes where a main character is in peril. A character is hit in the crotch in a slapstick fight. In a more serious fight, it appears that a character is killed, but it turns out not to be the case. Ella's mother becomes ill and dies. Ella is ordered to shoplift and due to the curse, must obey.\n|Educational Value|: Several times the characters mention the Grimm brothers, generally disparagingly for having gotten a fairy tale myth wrong, but it still may interest young readers in checking out Grimm's work.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's bad characters are frequently unattractive and garishly dressed, which sends an old-school fairy tale message about goodness and kindness always coinciding with beauty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ella is praised for being kind and good and is a generous-hearted and noble character one is pleased to see succeed. Characters who are selfish, greedy or evil are duly punished by the movie's end.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mostly mild, cartoonish, and played for laughs, but some sequences are pretty scary, i.e. when a giant ogre threatens to eat Ella and barbecue or shish kebab her; later she is shown trussed and about to be lowered into a boiling pot. Ella's curse also threatens to make her murder Prince Charmante; she stands threatening to stab him with a knife. Ella's mother also becomes ill and dies.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One of Ella's stepsisters is obsessed with a handsome prince, to the point where she puts up \"prince pin-ups\" on her wall and chases him with a crowd of girls. Ella implies she likes Char because of \"how cute his butt is.\" Ella and Prince Char flirt and kiss; there is a subplot about a female giant (dressed in a belly shirt) who falls for a small elf. She shoots him lusty glances and cradles him in her arms.

Like its predecessor, it has lots of strong sci-fi violence. Viewers see shootings, stabbings, killings, dripping blood, explosions, and death. A woman is slapped and kidnapped, and the main character (played by Matt Damon) goes through a gory operation (an exoskeleton is grafted onto his skin). Language is also an issue, with more than a dozen uses of \"f--k,\" and one use of \"s--t.\" There's a hint of drinking and drugs being an issue on the Earth of 2514 -- extras are seen drinking, and pills are offered -- but this idea goes nowhere. The movie's message, while heavy handed, is a plea for tolerance, especially among social classes.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's main message is a plea for tolerance, especially between different social classes. The movie illustrates the plight of the lower class, even as the upper class is painted as pure, evil villains. The \"haves\" look down their noses on the \"have-nots\" (and sometimes try to kill them). The movie's solution is simpleminded, but it at least addresses that the situation is wrong. The movie also makes a call for universal healthcare.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character isn't particularly complex, but he eventually learns that people can help one another without expecting anything in return. He sacrifices his own needs for the needs of others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Strong sci-fi violence, with lots of fighting and shooting and some stabbing and swordplay. Viewers see lots of dripping blood, and characters die. Many robots and spaceships explode. A man violently slaps and forcibly kidnaps a woman (and her sick young daughter) to get information out of her. A bad guy is shown with his face blown off. A robot cop breaks the main character's arm. He's also exposed to radiation and is shown feeling sick and throwing up. A gory surgery scene shows the main character having an exoskeleton grafted onto his body.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's a childhood romance between the main character and a nurse, but nothing comes of it -- no kissing, hugging, or even a date (he asks her to coffee, and she says yes, but they never get to go).\n|Language|: \"F--k\" is used many times. \"S--t\" is also heard, as well as one or two uses of \"balls,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"bitch.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: On Earth, some extras are shown drinking beer, and the main character is offered \"pills\" to take when he gets agitated. (He turns them down.) Nothing comes of this initial idea about the \"medicating\" of society.

Most of the peril is comic, but it still might be too much for kids under 5. And it's worth noting that the sarcastic tone that makes the main character so hilarious could be contagious for young fans. Keep an ear out for remarks like \"Me no likey\" and \"Yeah thanks, you've been a big help.\" In the end, though, the movie is about a selfish person who sees the error of his ways and reforms, which is a positive take-away.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a story about a spoiled, selfish character who undergoes a major transformation and becomes a good guy -- which sends a positive message about being able to change for the better.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kuzco starts out extremely spoiled -- so much so that he's fed, dressed, and catered to by everyone around him. But he evntually sees the error of his ways. Female characters are represented both positively and negatively. The way the men regard Yzma's wrinkles and her body (she's called \"scary beyond all reason\") reinforces some stereotypes, but Pacha's pregnant wife is very able to take care of herself. And Pacha himself believes that all people have some shred of goodness inside of them, so he doesn't give up on Kuzco, even when Kuzco treats him shabbily.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Though most of the violence is comic, slapstick violence, Yzma does try to kill Kuzco more than once, and she's not shy about saying: \"I will KILL you!\" Perilous falls and dark jungle scenes might be frightening for younger viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kuzco is told to pick a wife from a line of beautiful ladies, all of whom he insults.

An African-American character is a dim-witted, gentle giant, while an Asian character willingly does favors for sweet treats. And let's not forget Hispanic nimrod Jorge with his vapid stare -- apparently Efren Ramirez (Pedro in Napoleon Dynamite) isn't too concerned about being typecast. In one scene, Jorge pulls a knife, and Vince says to him, \"I thought you were Mexican, not Puerto Rican!\" What century is this, again?\n|Positive Messages|: Various cultures (Asian, Hispanic, African American) are stereotyped. Male characters try to win a contest to have sex with a female character. A boy begs his mom to buy toys. Name-calling. A character slacks off at work.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick violence. Characters run into a forklift, get caught in a cord and trip, fall off a counter, get hit with a locker door/mini-golf ball/tennis ball, collide while catching a baseball, and fall off an indoor porch swing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Characters compete to have sex with a girl.

As she helps her cousin prepare for his coming-of-magical-age ritual, she begins to question her role in the family. Expect a few scenes of violence: Mirabel's grandfather is killed by armed men (the actual death isn't shown), and supernatural events and catastrophes threaten the characters. There's also mild name-calling and affection between married characters. Themes of empathy, teamwork, and courage are clear, and there's strong diverse representation on-screen, with White, Black, and multiracial characters all part of the same family and voiced by famous Colombian and Latin American actors. Colombian culture is also well portrayed in the form of music, costumes, dance sequences, and even food, but the filmmaking team, including songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, isn't of Colombian heritage.\n|Educational Value|: Includes many aspects of Colombian culture, like traditional dress, dancing, music, even cuisine (arepas, a national food, are made and eaten several times).\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of positive messages about value of empathy and teamwork, importance of honesty and acceptance in families, the need to acknowledge various talents and character strengths of people you love.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Madrigals are helpful, strong, loyal. They love one another and want to protect and defend their family, house, town. The family exhibits the pride of serving their community, learns to accept help later in the movie. Mirabel is selfless and wants to solve problems even as she's occasionally overlooked because of her lack of superpowers.\n|Diverse Representations|: Depicts multigenerational, multiracial Madrigal family, as well as Encanto village that's full of residents who are Black, Brown, White. Women are strong, men are supportive (in this family, husbands don't have magical abilities, but their wives and children do), and a matriarch (Abuela) leads the family and village. Colombian culture is well portrayed in form of music, costumes, dance sequences, even food, but filmmaking team, including songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, isn't of Colombian heritage.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Flashbacks to a confrontation with armed men who kill Mirabel's abuelo with their swords while her abuela watches, holding newborn triplets. The family's home begins to crumble, and a nearby mountain splits in two, posing a danger to the family and entire village. Bruno is frightening at first sight but is just lonely. A character dangles from the edge of a cliff, and it looks like they're plunging to injury, but they end up fine. The house eventually falls, and it's occasionally scary to see all the family members fail in their attempts to save the house and their magic candle.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple is affectionate: kisses, embraces, and partner dances in flashbacks to their wedding and other occasions.\n|Language|: Mirabel calls her sister \"stupid perfect.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing on camera, but off camera, the movie has tie-ins to apparel, toys, figurines, even instruments.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A kid drinks coffee even after being told it's for adults.

That said, there are quite a few product placements (not to mention the tie-ins to the whole Disney Princess juggernaut) and one scene of a character getting drunk at a bar.\n|Positive Messages|: Sends the message that even though true love doesn't always come in a predictable \"Prince Charming\" package, your dreams can still come true.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite Giselle's differences, her enthusiasm and positive outlook are ultimately appreciated.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A wicked witch tries to poison Giselle; Edward wields his sword against a troll and out and about in New York City (no one is hurt). Nathaniel takes out his frustrations on Pip, mostly to humorous effect. The queen transforms into a big, threatening dragon and tries to kill Giselle and Robert (after doing her best to do Giselle in via other means).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses, including \"true love's kiss,\" and a scene of Giselle modestly coming out of the shower and getting wrapped in a towel.

There's a central good vs. evil theme, as well as a parent vs. adolescent storyline that should appeal to kids, but know that there are definitely battles and even a small body count (mostly due to arrows). The main villain is merciless and believes that it's his mission to destroy the forest and rule over a rotting wasteland. In addition to the violence, there's a romantic nature to two relationships in the movie, as well as several flirty (and snotty) jokes courtesy of a slug voiced by Aziz Ansari. Expect some insult language (\"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" etc.).\n|Educational Value|: Epic aims to teach young viewers the importance of the forest and its fauna and flora. Even the slugs play an important role in the maintenance of the forest. The characters also teach kids why they should pay attention to their elders and live up to their potential.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about children trusting their parents, the maturity it takes to stop thinking of just yourself and doing what's best for your people, the vital part that every creature plays in the thriving of a forest, and the necessity of teamwork to overcome various obstacles.\n|Positive Role Models|: M.K. realizes that her father is right about the Leafmen and decides to help, even though she's scared and doesn't at first understand the tiny fantastical world she's thrust into. Nod stops doing things just for himself or his own glory and commits himself to the Leafmen and their creed when M.K. needs help.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A couple of characters (both \"good\" and \"evil\") die in battle from arrow wounds and falling to their death. The Leafmen and the Boggans fight in armed formations. The Boggans can cause plants to die with rot, and their goal is to make the forest a wasteland with nothing but rot and death. A character is presumed dead but is just gravely injured. There are several \"close calls\" when it seems like it's the end for sympathetic/favorite characters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Queen Tara and Ronin, head of the Leafmen, flirt and embrace.

Young kids may be confused by the storyline, which centers on an aging Santa (who's not dressed in the traditional red, so as to blend in) seeking out his replacement for the job, so it likely will raise more questions about the St. Nick legend than it's worth. Older kids and tweens will have more patience for Ernest's particular brand of comedy, and they'll be able to recognize the heartening story surrounding a runaway's journey back home.

There are some deaths in the movie: A father is killed when a spaceship lands on him, a man plummets to his doom from the air, and a freed alien is eaten by a much larger, scary-looking alien. A general is sadistic and likes to torture/exploit aliens. Unlike many other animated movies, this one doesn't shy away from sexuality, either: Alien couples kiss several times, a female admires her boyfriend's body, several characters comment on a \"nerdy\" character's beautiful wife, and online dating is even referenced. Lastly, families sensitive to consumerism should know that there are parts of the movie that seem practically like a commercial for 7-Eleven.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: The story does have some positive messages about the importance of family, what it means to display courage under fire, and why it's necessary to do everything possible to stop the rise of tyranny. On the other hand, stay-at-home moms and engineers/scientists are insulted repeatedly, even if they eventually save the day. And it might confuse really young kids to see the U.S. military depicted as containing not just a vengeful general but also a host of soldiers willing to follow his orders.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gary and Kira are loving parents and make decisions to help save their loved ones. Despite his narcissism, Scorch really is quite brave and adores his nephew, admires his brother, and loves his girlfriend.

A young alien mother and her child are tied up and held against their will. A man plummets to his death. A friendly alien nonetheless has anger-management issues. There are dart guns and laser guns and both human/alien weapons.

Prison guards torture inmates, and bloody wounds are stitched up in a doctor's office. Language is also strong, with multiple uses of \"f--k\" and \"motherf--ker\" as well as minimal uses of other words. There's also some minor sexual innuendo, including references to a \"whore\" and a hand motion referring to oral sex. The mood is light, and the movie is dumb fun for fans.\n|Positive Messages|: Perseverance and teamwork are the positive themes. At one point, the main character loses heart and begins to think that maybe, this time, he can't do it. But eventually, with help from his friend, he gets his strength and his resolve back. He goes on to solve a tremendously difficult puzzle, against tough odds. However, the movie contains tons of violence with no consequences.\n|Positive Role Models|: These characters aren't really very admirable, resorting to violence without consequences, though they both love their families and they seem like good guys under the circumstances. Both actors are still in really good shape for their late sixties, and they are good examples of what exercise and clean living can do.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tons of over-the-top action-movie violence, with dozens of faceless guards being shot and killed. A fair amount of blood is shown, especially when one of the good guys is shot in the stomach, and one of the bad guys falls down a flight of stairs and smashes his head. The inmates fight a great deal with lots of punching and pummeling, the guards are shown beating inmates into submission. Some scenes take place in a doctor's office with bloody wounds being stitched up, or needles being injected. A character is tortured with a high powered hose in his mouth.

Language includes several uses of \"s--t\" and less frequent uses of \"f--k,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" etc. A character starts to smoke a cigarette and is stopped, and a man takes a big swig from a flask. Sex isn't an issue, but there's a small, possible moment of romantic tension between two characters. While this isn't a great sequel, it does offer enough clever puzzles to generate some nail-biting suspense, especially for fans of the original.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie prizes teamwork and characters who help one another to survive, remaining calm in a crisis and sometimes risking their lives rather than looking out for themselves. This theme comes through clearly despite the overall story arc involving characters who are seemingly trapped inside a puzzle forever.\n|Positive Role Models|: Zoey, a young Black woman, emerges as the natural leader (with Ben championing her the whole way) and refuses to bow down to the villains. She's strong and unflappable and learns to face her fears. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have a good ending for her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Brutal deaths via electrocution, quicksand, acid rain. Many sequences of intense peril, tension, threat, screaming, etc. Characters injured: cuts, scratches, scrapes, burns, etc. Fall from high place. Character almost drowns. Flashbacks to characters dying in the first movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One small moment of possible romantic tension, but nothing comes of it.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--kers,\" and one partial \"f--k,\" several uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"sons of bitches,\" \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mention of Uber.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Character tries to smoke a cigarette in a car, but the driver says no.

There is frequent profanity throughout the film; the F-word, among others, is used quite a bit. Characters are often shown drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes and marijuana. In one scene, a woman stumbles into the apartment of her boyfriend after drunkenly driving his car into a fire hydrant. In another scene, a man is arguing with his girlfriend about how he likes to get high on marijuana to balance out being drunk. These scenes, and the general theme of preserving memories in spite of the pain they cause in the aftermath of a failed relationship, make this film best for mature teens and adults.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie explores the idea that it's better to have loved someone and known all the joy the experience brings -- in spite of the hurt and sorrow that might come with the relationship and the relationship's ending -- than to go through life unscathed without having met that person.\n|Positive Role Models|: In spite of their imperfections and the difficulties in their failing relationship, Joel and Clementine grow to realize that the memories and experiences they shared are important and necessary to who they are as individuals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: While reliving a memory as a tween, the lead character is caught masturbating by his mother.

It focuses on a team of ancient aliens who emerge after the events of Avengers: Endgame to battle the monstrous Deviants they thought they had defeated long ago. With a cast that includes Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and more, this is one of the MCU's most diverse outings; it features the franchise's first deaf character and first openly gay hero. It's also arguably the MCU's most mature and character-driven film to date. It has themes of sacrifice, unconditional love, and teamwork, but also far more romance than usual -- including the MCU's first on-screen love scene (naked shoulders and all) -- and very scary creatures, one of whom eats a parent in front of his child in the movie's opening scene. While there are lots of talking scenes, action violence is also frequent and often devastating, both in a large-scale way (genocide, natural disasters, destruction) and an intimate one (betrayal, loss, grief). Weapons are used, and spoiler alert! main characters die/are killed. Language includes occasional but not frequent use of \"s--t\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" etc., and characters drink socially.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's themes include the conflict between sacrificing the few for the many and understanding that humanity is responsible for unthinkable violence but also great beauty, art, and curiosity. When you love something, you protect it. The story encourages teamwork, empathy, compassion, and unconditional love. The Eternals love and respect one another, even when they disagree.\n|Positive Role Models|: Central characters willingly put themselves in dangerous situations to save humanity/defeat villains. Gilgamesh selflessly cares for Thena, who is brave, fierce, and loyal. Sersi is compassionate and empathetic. Sprite is clever and quick-witted. Ikaris is devoted and faithful to his cause. Druig prioritizes peace. Kingo is entertaining and ambitious. Makkari is courageous and well-read. Dane is loyal to Sersi. A few characters are willing to do something immoral in order to stay faithful to their mission/do what they think is right in the end.\n|Diverse Representations|: The ensemble is racially and ethnically diverse; Asian, Latinx, Black, White, and deaf actors are authentically represented (their characters are aliens). Characters use sign language to communicate. Phastos is the first openly gay hero in the MCU.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Eternals use their superpowers and superweapons to defeat scary, aggressive monsters known as Deviants (one of which eats a parent in front of a child in the movie's opening scene); some goopy gore when they're killed. Characters are injured but usually healed (or can heal themselves). Human bystanders are killed by the fighting between Eternals and Deviants. Gun and knife use. The Eternals witness soldiers committing genocide during the Aztec Empire. The bombing of Hiroshima is shown, along with its afermath. Global earthquake, volcano eruption. Spoiler alert: Main characters die/are killed, and Earth is threatened with total destruction.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adults exchange lingering looks, kisses, and embraces. There's one love scene that shows bare shoulders/backs and passionate kissing; sex is clearly implied. A married couple kisses farewell. Another couple never kisses but flirts and hugs. An Eternal who's perpetually young complains about not being old enough to experience love (and has an overt crush on an older team member). One relationship is loving and affectionate (the two characters have lived together for centuries) but not overtly romantic.\n|Language|: Language includes \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"oh God,\" \"sucks,\" \"mental.\" Middle-finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera: iPhone, Star Wars book, Ikea; off-camera, Marvel has a ton of tie-ins for all its movies.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink beer at a party and liquor on a plane.

It centers on a middle-aged laundromat owner named Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), who discovers she must help save the multiverse during a routine trip to file her business taxes. Expect occasional strong language (mostly several uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t\"), as well as plenty of violence, including stylized martial arts sequences that use both real and improvised weapons and include close-range brawling. There are a few deaths and a couple of bloody scenes. People kiss, there are super-quick shots of the main character making love (the focus is on her face or back), and you'll see fighting sex toys (both as weapons and skill amplifiers). Diverse representation includes a non-stereotypical Chinese American family and two women over 50 in central roles, as well as two women in a loving and supportive relationship. Families will have plenty to discuss after watching the movie, which is best suited for older teens and adults.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages courage, empathy, honesty, self-control, teamwork. Stresses importance of self-awareness, acceptance, resilience. Reminds viewers not to underestimate the power of laughter and small moments, that life is more about who you're with than what you have. Parent-child issues are a major theme. Story explores heavy topics such as depression, ennui, marital disappointment, and homophobia -- but with a heavy dose of levity, googly eyes, and hope.\n|Positive Role Models|: Evelyn isn't always likable, but she literally contains multitudes. She's brave, strong-willed, and fierce. She recognizes her failures and asks for forgiveness. Waymond is goofy, optimistic, kind. Even when Evelyn is cruel or apathetic, Waymond remains devoted to their family. Joy is depressed but also loves her partner and wants to heal her unhealthy relationship. There's even a lot more to Deirdre, who's surprisingly patient and forgiving.\n|Diverse Representations|: Movie centers a 50-something Chinese woman and her family in a way that isn't stereotypical, despite the fact that they own a laundromat in the current multiverse. Joy is queer and has a girlfriend she's trying to include in family events. Strong multigenerational theme.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In addition to martial arts-inspired fight sequences between Evelyn and the forces from the other verses, several characters from the multiverse die and battle with weapons (usually found objects, from a fanny pack to a trophy, but also real weapons). Some violence is comic, some bloody and realistic.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In a scene where all versions of Evelyn are quickly shown, a couple are making love, showing her face and naked shoulders (these are blink-and-miss moments). Evelyn and her husband (or different versions of him) kiss in a few scenes. Phallic sex toys are used in a fight scene. Suggestive joke about a sex toy (a \"butt plug\") that's used as a prize for IRS auditors; later, two different men use it to invoke their special skills. In one case, the man who uses it is naked from the waist down. His crotch area is obscured, but audiences can see his butt during the fight scenes.\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"f---ing,\" \"holy s--t,\" \"s--t,\" \"stupid,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: iPhone.

Expect tons of over-the-top cartoonish violence, crashes and explosions, guns and shooting, deaths, fighting, punching, kicking, martial arts, hitting with blunt objects, and large-scale destruction. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" etc. There's a vaguely sex-related joke (about \"compensating\") and two scenes of scantily clad women dancing. Characters share beer and drink whiskey in public spaces.\n|Positive Messages|: Like others in series, this movie promotes ideas of family and loyalty, but characters don't always seem to trust each other, and they're all prone to excessive violence without many consequences. One character talks about surprising fact that, despite all the dangerous stuff the team does, they rarely get hurt.\n|Positive Role Models|: It's hard to call the main characters role models, given the sheer destruction they cause (with no consequences), but they do risk their lives to save the world and protect their loved ones, and do stand up against impossible odds. The women are smart and self-sufficient, the crew is diverse, their teamwork as strong as ever. Characters discuss what it means to be part of a world-saving team of heroes.

While there are enchanting dancing flowers, hippos, unicorns, and striking visuals that show the relationship of sight and sound, there are at least as many very threatening images intensified by the shadowy dark music. Out-of-control broomsticks launch a massive flood; ferocious dinosaurs with teeth bared and giant clamping jaws fight a death battle; lightning and thunder introduce death and despair in the guise of skeletons, graves, bats, evil armies, and ghosts. There are several scenes which depict the romance of many mythological beings (centaurs, cherubim) and in which many of the characters are modestly unclothed. Some additional selections, including one which follows the evolution of the species over millions of years from an amoeba to the end of the giant dinosaur era, are very long, slow and may not fully engage today's kids. The film is most valuable as an historical experience.\n|Educational Value|: A narrator augments the animated portions of the film and introduces many orchestral instruments and musical concepts. He guides the audience through some of the great classics (Shubert, Beethoven, Stravinsky and more), giving tips to help enrich the musical experience.\n|Positive Messages|: Music, color, movement, and feeling are closely connected. Music is a powerful means of expression. In \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", as well as a few of the other segments, characters demonstrate curiosity, courage, and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: In the \"Pastoral\" section, which depicts the romance of mythological characters, the male and female centaurs have old-fashioned male-female roles. The females bat their eyelashes and weaken in the presence of the strong, protective males.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" Mickey Mouse is a young wizard who cannot control the frenzied brooms that his magic has set in motion. The result is an intense storm, a giant whirlpool, and waves of water completely overpowering the scene.In \"Rites of Spring\" there are erupting volcanoes, massive earthquakes, fires and explosions and a final fight to the death between two ferocious dinosaurs.

There are several evil characters: an overpowering jack-in-the-box with glaring eyes and scary teeth, some marauding rats, soaring and threatening eagles, raging fires, giant waves, and one Penn & Teller trick depicting an axe and a severed hand (immediately shown to be pretend). In addition, a young whale is momentarily separated from its parents, and Donald Duck loses track of Daisy for a period of time to their great dismay. Fantasia 2000 is a sequel to Fantasia, which was originally made in 1940 and has been released numerous times. This newer film is a shorter, modern version with computer-generated images, a faster pace, more humor and more of the slick animation today's audiences expect.\n|Educational Value|: This film serves as an introduction to symphonic music and its capacity to build both story and emotion. The well-known works of classic composers (Shostakovich, Respighi, Wagner, Gershwin, and more) underscore the pictures on the screen. The relationship between sight and sound is clearly explained by a series of celebrity narrators.\n|Positive Messages|: Music is a powerful way to enhance storytelling and heighten emotions.\n|Positive Role Models|: There are a number of (all male) heroic characters who bravely triumph over evil.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Penn and Teller pretend to hack off a hand, but it is quickly shown to be a trick.

Based on J.K. Rowling's original story, it takes place in 1920s New York City and follows Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a magizoologist and author of a Hogwarts textbook that catalogs magical creatures. As per usual in the Potter saga, you can expect plenty of fantasy violence, some of which ends in deaths (a couple are pretty gruesome). There's also mass destruction, although the property destroyed is magically fixed, and the minds of the No-Maj (\"no magic\") folks are always erased. Wizards engage in wand battles, two wizards are sentenced to death and nearly killed, and an out-of-control form of magic nearly destroys whole swaths of Manhattan. A character's mother beats him with a belt (welts, cuts are shown on his hands). One scene takes place in a speakeasy, where adult characters order drinks, and there's a bit of light romance between couples that ends in goodbye kisses, longing looks, and brief caresses. Unlike the original Harry Potter movies, the main characters here are all adults, and the story is much more of a grown-up suspense/thriller than a kid-centric adventure. But themes and messages include curiosity, compassion, and courage, and the main characters are all strong role models.\n|Positive Messages|: This movie's messages, while grounded in the wizarding world, have applications in the real world, too: Learn about a creature (or person) instead of assuming it's dangerous, be open-minded in interactions with those who aren't like you, and work together against the forces of darkness. Compassion is a theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Newt Scamander is a wonderful role model. He cares for, studies, and protects magical creatures. He wants them to be understood, not feared. He's curious, determined, and disciplined in his work and compassionate and kind in his dealings with others -- not to mention courageous. Tina Goldstein is persistent and confident even though she's no longer an Auror. Queenie is a kind, loving sister who sees beyond the fact Jacob is a No-Maj. Jacob gets over his initial fear to bravely help Newt.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mass destruction, and a few character deaths and injuries. A force of suppressed, out-of-control magic kills two No-Maj characters pretty hideously. Wizards and witches engage in wand battle. A wizard and witch are sentenced to die in a pool of an acid-like substance. Credence's mother beats him; a scene shows him taking off his belt and handing it to her -- his hands are later shown with welts and cuts.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Queenie is in a slip when first shown; she puts her dress on in front of male guests, one of whom ogles her. She also changes into a nightie and alludes to a man thinking what most boys think when they first see her. Two characters kiss. Another couple stares longingly at each other and holds each other.\n|Language|: \"Merlin's Beard,\" \"hell,\" \"bugger,\" \"freak,\" \"anus.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No brands are featured in the movie, but the film is part of the global Harry Potter phenomenon that has spawned countless products, from toys to games, clothing, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A scene takes place in a speakeasy; characters order drinks at the bar -- specifically, a magical drink implied to contain alcohol that's called \"giggle water\" (it literally makes characters giggle).

It has even more violence than the previous movie did, with character deaths, injuries, magical battles, and lots of mass destruction. Set in 1927, the movie still centers on magizoologist and Hogwarts textbook author Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). When dangerous wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes and rallies his followers, a much younger Professor Dumbledore (Jude Law) asks Newt to intervene. These characters may be adults, but other than their tendency to get into danger and magical duels, they're pretty tame: There's just a little bit of (butter) beer drinking and cuddling and a noticeable lack of cursing (Ron Weasley swore more than they do!). And the story's themes of courage and teamwork are clear. Still, the movie's often dark tone and battle standoffs may be too much for the youngest Potterheads.\n|Positive Messages|: Many messages similar to first Fantastic Beasts film: Learn about a creature or person instead of assuming it's dangerous or evil, be open-minded in interactions with those not like you, work together against forces of darkness. But also strong message to be wary of seductive, persuasive speakers who may have hidden agendas, be aware that not making decision or taking action can be just as much of a choice as choosing one side or the other.\n|Positive Role Models|: Newt continues to be positive role model: He's hardworking, dedicated, patient, loyal. He doesn't believe in dismissing or banishing evil/dangerous magical animals; he befriends, studies, cares for all sorts of creatures. He treats people with dignity no matter their reputation or background. Tina Goldstein is courageous, self-assured; Queenie is kind and loving, if somewhat misguided and impressionable. Jacob is not magical but still brave, clever. Young Dumbledore is wise, brilliant, caring (but also a bit manipulative).\n|Violence & Scariness|: From opening sequence to climactic battle scene, there's a high body count, with many character deaths and/or injuries. Mass destruction. Wizards and witches engage in wand battles. Villainous wizards deceive, ambush other wizards and non-magical humans, including children. Characters die/are injured from animal attacks, unforgivable curses (both in duels and execution-style murders, but spells are often unheard or nonverbal), drowning, and magical fire. Characters can magically turn into animals and/or amorphous destructive forces that kill. Implied coercive sexual relationship.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Queenie and Jacob kiss and embrace (in one scene, he rests his head on her bosom). An engaged couple kisses and hugs.

This movie jumps ahead five years and continues the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he helps Professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) in his mission to stop evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen) from seizing control of the Wizarding World. The Fantastic Beasts series is as dark and intense as the final Potter films, but it centers on adult characters rather than teens. The violence is intense. It includes frightening scenes involving the use of Unforgivable Curses that torture, control, and kill, as well as significant property destruction, mob scenes, scary creatures (including a giant tentacled prison beast), and duels. Language is mild (\"Jeez,\" \"hell,\" a few insults), and there are a couple of hugs and kisses, as well as discussion of past romantic relationships. Representation includes gay characters, and supporting characters who are Black and Asian. As with the previous films, messages focus on being open-minded in interactions with those who aren't like you and working together against the forces of darkness.\n|Positive Messages|: Consistent with the rest of the series: Learn about a creature or person before assuming they're dangerous or evil, be open-minded in interactions with those who aren't like you, and work together against forces of darkness. Also a strong message to be wary of seductive, persuasive speakers who may have hidden agendas and to stand up against discrimination, oppression, and supremacists of any kind.

He treats people with dignity no matter their reputation or background. Jacob is brave, clever, loyal. Dumbledore is wise, brilliant, caring but can also be manipulative and secretive. Various supporting characters who help Dumbledore are intelligent and talented witches and wizards; characters who make mistakes are able to recover from them/redeem themselves. Grindelwald is a bigoted pure-blood supremacist who believes not only in the supremacy of wizards over Muggles but also in the sanctity of pure-blood wizards.\n|Diverse Representations|: While a few core supporting characters are Black and Asian, most main characters are White. Two principal characters are gay; their past relationship is an important part of the story. An important part of the story takes place in Bhutan; the setting is somewhat exoticized. Female characters are less central to the storyline in this installment but do play key roles in the overall mission.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes of villainous wizards fighting wizard authorities and civilians and throwing Unforgivable Curses (forcing their victims' bodies to obey, torturing them, or killing them) with their wands. A wizard slits the throat of a baby animal (blood spilled and used for spells) and then magically reanimates it. Wizards duel dramatically, causing property destruction and injuries and deaths. Newt and Theseus must escape a dank, creepy prison where magical creatures nearly kill them (and do kill/eat other prisoners); one is particularly large and scary, with menacing tentacles and pincers. Grindelwald threatens war against all Muggles and talks of burning down the world. Restless/riotous crowds, sometimes purposely stirred up by those who want trouble. Lally is harassed by three men in a menacing way (though it turns out to be a setup). Fire imagery in several scenes. In a sequence played for humor, villainous wizards are attacked by avalanches of pastries, books, and Bludgers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters hug and kiss. Flirting and flattery between characters. One character discusses how much he was in love with another, and a plot point includes how former lovers have a blood oath with each other.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of \"Jeez\" and \"hell.\" Insult language like \"cuckoo,\" \"coward,\" \"stupid sod,\" \"these animals.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie; off camera, tons of Wizarding World-related tie-ins and products, from toys to games, apparel, jewelry, and -- of course -- books.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Aberforth runs a pub where adult wizards drink what's implied to be liquor. Adult wizards at a fancy reception have what looks like champagne. Jacob tosses back a drink at the train car bar and has wine in other scenes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683a8718ba001e315ec1": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fast-furious", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Fast & Furious is the action-packed fourth installment in the Fast and Furious series that's heavily marketed to teens. There's plenty of violence, including explosions, shoot outs, fistfights, and lots of car chases -- which end in at least a few deaths (though most are implied rather than shown directly). There are only two love scenes (and the camera cuts before the act itself), but there's plenty of other risque stuff, including several shots of half-dressed women kissing each other and dancing provocatively. Language includes frequent use of words like \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"p---y,\" as well as Spanish curse words. Characters drink and smoke, and drugs/the drug trade plays a central role in the plot.\n|Positive Messages|: Although they engage in ongoing illegal activity and plenty of other iffy behavior, Dom and his loved ones are tight-knit and occasionally do the right thing. The government, particularly the FBI, is depicted as ineffective and caring more about how they're perceived than about stopping crime.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dom is a vigilante motivated by vengeance and grief -- but he helps bring a criminal to justice. On the positive side, the two female supporting characters are strong, and the cast is impressively culturally diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Explosions, gun fights, bloody fistfights, fatal car chases, and a few disturbing deaths -- someone is purposely mowed down by a car, and someone else is murdered execution style.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Although there's no nudity, bikini-clad women are shown throughout the film, and in several scenes half-dressed women are shown kissing each other. A man sucks on a woman's toes and encourages women to make out with each other. Two couples kiss passionately.\n|Language|: Frequently used language includes \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"ass,\" \"bulls---t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"bitch,\" one use of \"f--k,\" and Spanish curse words like cojones and chinga.\n|Products & Purchases|: Automobile companies are well represented: Honda, Ford, Porsche, Nissan, Plymouth, and more. Also Corona beer and Castrol Motor Oil.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink cocktails, beer, and shots of hard liquor at several parties. Drugs are mentioned, offered, and shown wrapped up for delivery but never used. The Los Angeles-Mexican drug trade is a central plot point of the film. A few characters smoke cigarettes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768caad5437001f74fc42": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fast-furious-6", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Fast & Furious 6 is the sixth movie in the long-running series that began with 2001's The Fast and the Furious. Like its predecessors, it's focused on car chases, explosions, and objectifying women. There are tons of exploding vehicles and lots of violent fighting, plus some shooting and some death (though very little blood). There are some minor sexual situations, but no actual nudity is shown. Language is somewhat strong, including one \"f--k\" and several uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"p---y.\" Characters are seen drinking Corona beer from time to time. The previous movie, Fast Five, reinvigorated the series and became its biggest hit, so teens are likely to be all fired up for this one -- though it's not as good from a story perspective.\n|Positive Messages|: The good guys swear by their \"family\" in this movie, although there's an awful lot of splitting up, as opposed to teamwork. Characters disappear to take care of various errands alone and are asked to leave their families (including newborn infants) behind to go on dangerous missions. But the message here is still arguably better than in some of the earlier movies in this series.\n|Positive Role Models|: Other than characters with various skills (science, driving, etc.) and some tough women who can take care of themselves, these folks are mostly violent criminals who leave destruction in their wake. That said, the series' diversity is worth noting.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cars blow up, as well as a huge plane and a tank. Some characters die, but others emerge with just a few scratches (if any). There's a great deal of fighting, kicking, punching, and beating with various objects, but it's all done in an over-the-top, cartoonish way. No one really ever seems to get hurt, though one character gets a broken nose, with a little blood shown. Some guns and shooting. One character is shot in the shoulder (no blood), and another character is shot with a kind of high-tech harpoon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Women are objectified, frequently shown in revealing outfits or bikinis. In one scene, a main male character is shown in bed with a girlfriend. Both are naked but are arranged so that nothing sensitive is shown. Another character is shown taking four women on a \"date\" in his private jet. In another scene, male and female characters compare scars, requiring them to pull back certain items of clothing an inch or two. Otherwise, romantically involved couples are seen kissing/touching from time to time.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--k,\" and more frequent use of other words, including \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: The Dodge Charger is referred to by name a couple of times. In one scene, a character shoots a vending machine, and a large selection of (free) candy bars is on display. A Coke machine stands next to it. Characters frequently drink Corona beer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters are shown drinking beer in a few scenes, in a social way. No one gets drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d4cfb0d55001f59ca93": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fast-furious-presents-hobbs-shaw", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is a spin-off of the hugely successful Fast & Furious series, centering on the characters played by Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Expect the usual over-the-top amount of comic book/cartoon-style action violence: car chases and crashes, explosions, fights, guns and shooting, and torture (fairly mild). Minor characters are killed. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and \"bastard,\" plus one muffled, obscured use of \"f--k\" and a few other words. Characters drink socially (shots, beer, etc.). A couple shares a lingering, passionate kiss, and there's some flirting, innuendo, and objectification of women (the camera lingers on a woman's bottom in a dance club, cleavage is shown, etc.) -- but overall, women are stronger and more independent in this movie than in previous ones in the franchise. With bigger star power and less at stake, this turns out to be one of the better entries in the series.\n|Positive Messages|: Like other movies in series, this one is about \"family.\" Though message is more emotional: Being in a family is less about action, more about communication, actually showing up for one another. \"Frenemies\" learn to set aside their differences, work together. Women are less objectified in this film than in previous ones, are stronger, more independent, with more personality.\n|Positive Role Models|: It's hard to call the main characters role models, given the amount of sheer destruction they cause (with no consequences), but they do risk their lives to save the world and protect their loved ones, and they do stand up against impossible odds. Hattie is a very strong, tough, smart woman who's capable of fighting her own fights and makes her own choices.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely strong, comic book/cartoon-style action violence. Guns and shooting. Torture. Explosions. Car chases and car crashes. Martial arts fighting, punching, hitting, etc. Minor characters are killed. Threat of a deadly virus destroying the world. Flamethrower. Painful operation on a cyborg, with his back sliced open.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Long, passionate kiss. Camera passes over a dancing woman's bottom. Cleavage on display. Sexual innuendo and sex-related language.\n|Language|: Fairly strong language, with uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"c--k,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"bastard,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"d--k,\" \"balls,\" \"wanker,\" \"give a toss,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" (as an exclamation). A character says \"f--k,\" but it's muffled, and his mouth is obscured. A character makes a sexual gesture. One possible, obscured use of \"c--t,\" but it's hard to be sure.\n|Products & Purchases|: LinkedIn mentioned.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Social drinking; a character pours himself a pint of beer, and a character drinks a tumbler of whiskey and pours a comically large tumbler for a third character (who doesn't drink). A character downs two shots of alcohol at once.

It's very violent, with shoot-outs that leave one character dead and another seriously wounded. A character takes one risk that appears suicidal. Characters drink and smoke. Corona beer seems to be an especially obvious product placement, and giving someone a beer is a gesture of honor and acceptance. There are kisses between opposite-sex and same-sex couples, some very questionable behavior, and women in scanty clothing who are constantly objectified. A woman's breasts are shown through a wet shirt. A woman tells a driver at the starting line of a street race that if he wins, he gets to have a threesome with her and another woman. Men grope at women's breasts and rear ends. Characters use very strong language, including \"f--k\" and the \"N\" word and other racial slurs. Viewers see some gross photographs of an injured man. Characters are in extreme peril, both in racing and in shoot-outs. Robbing and shooting are sympathetically portrayed, and Brian's ultimate decision is a serious betrayal.\n|Positive Messages|: At the beginning of the DVD, one of the lead actors delivers a \"Don't try this at home\"-style PSA regarding all the high-speed car races and chases.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gangs mostly divide along racial lines; strong female characters, but also many stereotypes. Though the movie tries to show depth to the characters -- one mourns the loss of his father, another suffers from ADD -- the time devoted to the unrelenting car races and chases prevents any further developments.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Unsurprisingly, there are frequent illegal street races and car chases. Pictures of a man after he was beaten in the face repeatedly with a wrench. A man gets a nozzle shoved into his mouth and is forced to drink motor oil. This same man is later kicked in the head. A trucker fires a shotgun at drivers trying to hijack his truck. Machine-gun fire in a drive-by shooting. A character gets hit in the head with a baseball bat. A fistfight results in visible blood.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Women serve as objectified eye candy in skimpy outfits around the cars and their drivers. A woman's breasts are shown through a wet shirt. A woman tells a driver at the starting line of a street race that if he wins, he gets to have a threesome with her and another woman. Men grope at women's breasts and rear ends. There are kisses between opposite-sex and same-sex couples.\n|Language|: The \"N\" word is used once.

Language includes one \"f--k\" and several uses of \"s--t.\" There's social drinking, kissing between a couple, and many scantily clad women on display and treated as sex objects.\n|Positive Messages|: The main characters engage in illegal activities so they can earn enough money to disappear and live comfortably for the rest of their lives. They plan to steal from a Brazilian gangster, but that doesn't necessarily make their crime more acceptable. Although they work together and solve problems, they also create rampant destruction and violence with no consequences.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters may seem \"cool,\" but they're lawbreakers and troublemakers.

Due to the subject matter, it should come as no surprise that the movie can get emotionally intense -- especially when there's a devastating death. The central relationship is beautiful and mature and does lead to a love scene, which is handled tastefully for teen audiences (a girl's naked back and boy's chest are seen). Language is rare but does include one use of \"f--k,\" as well as words like \"s--t\" and \"a--hole.\" The teen characters drink champagne together, and a key adult supporting character is a drunk who's nearly always sipping from something. Gus also frequently puts unlit cigarettes in his mouth. As long as your teens are ready for all the feelings, sadness, and romance, this is a lovely film to watch with them, especially since Hazel's parents are portrayed so positively (they're supportive, loving, and understanding).\n|Positive Messages|: The movie, like the book, has important messages about the purpose of life: what it means to make your mark in the world and to be loved and remembered, how love can feel infinite even in a finite number of days, and how what afflicts you isn't what defines you. Most of the messages are about life, love, and relationships -- as well as literature and what it means to feel connected to the books we read. Gus' motto that you can't keep yourself from getting hurt -- but you can choose wisely about who you allow to hurt you -- is a powerful one.\n|Positive Role Models|: In many YA/teen stories, the parents are portrayed as insensitive or even antagonistic, but Hazel's mom and dad are amazing: supportive, loving, and understanding of her needing time and space to be with Augustus. Hazel and Gus don't let their cancer keep them away from each other, and Gus especially feels strongly about surrounding himself with beauty and joy, particularly Hazel.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The way that cancer physically and emotionally affects the teen characters is likely to disturb and upset viewers. A key character's death devastates other characters (as well as the audience). Characters egg another character's car.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's one love scene, and it's more emotional than physical in its depiction and doesn't feel gratuitous. It takes place between two teens who are both virgins, and this is their one and only time making love. The girl has her top off, but you just see her back and the boy's chest.

He goes around with the same cigarette pack for most of the movie. Gus and Hazel drink champagne together twice. Author Peter Van Houten is a drunk and is nearly always shown with a drink or a flask in his hand.

The movie has strong messages of nonviolence, respect for Ferdinand's principles, and the friendships that can develop between creatures who are very different from each other. Ferdinand finds clever ways to avoid violence and conflict, including humor and kindness. That said, in some scenes, Ferdinand and other bulls (particularly those who aren't physically large and aggressive) are called things like \"soft,\" \"flower boy,\" \"loser,\" and \"dork,\" though the message sent by these names is ultimately undermined by Ferdinand's nonviolent triumph. Expect a few potentially sad and/or scary scenes: Ferdinand is slashed with a spear when he's trying to avoid a bullfight, a tense rescue scene takes place in a meat-processing facility, a baby is in danger in a large crowd (Ferdinand protects her), and Ferdinand sends people flying into the air (no one appears hurt). One character says that either bulls die in the bullring or go to the \"chop shop.\" A young bull loses his dad (offscreen); we see him searching for his father and crying when he realizes his dad won't be coming back. There's some crude humor and innuendo: One character says a bunch of bulls will \"fertilize the lawn\" after being surprised, and a female character admires a male character's physique. And while Ferdinand is a strong, confident character who's a great role model of courage and compassion, some supporting characters are depicted a little stereotypically: An aggressive bull is voiced by an Italian actor with \"tough mob guy\" flavor, and some horses are given German accents and snooty \"European\" mannerisms.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn about some of the cultural traditions surrounding the Spanish style of bullfighting, including some of the controversy related to the sport. They may also learn more about how sport animals are kept and treated and may have some questions about other animals, like racehorses. A few lines of dialogue are in Spanish.\n|Positive Messages|: Ferdinand's refusal to fight in the ring and his confidence in his nonviolent stance sends a strong message of individuality. He learns how to work out his problems without fighting, through quick and innovative thinking, as well as kindness and humor. His fellow animals often call him things like \"soft\" or \"flower boy,\" which implies that he's somehow weak or unmasculine. While these messages are subverted by the movie's ending -- Ferdinand is clearly a strong character -- they may still have an impact on young viewers. Themes include compassion and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ferdinand is a gentle and loving bull; he has obstacles but finds a way to get around them without compromising his principles. His character is happiest pursuing traditionally feminine pursuits (gardening, dancing, spending time with family), but he's also proudly strong and powerful. He doesn't believe that his interests are the only \"right way\"; he encourages his new friends to find their own \"thing\" that makes them happy. Nina has a tender relationship with him and accepts him as he is. Lupe is a daffy underdog who sees in Ferdinand her chance to back a winning horse, and she's a loyal friend. The largely male cast does include some stereotypes, such as Valiente, an aggressive bull voiced by an Italian actor with \"tough guy\" intonations, and a trio of high-stepping horses who have German accents and snooty \"Euro\" mannerisms. But many of the male characters learn, thanks to Ferdinand, that fighting and aggression aren't their only options.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Whether or not Ferdinand can -- or should -- compete in the violent Spanish sport of bullfighting is the movie's central question, and the final scenes take place in a bullfighting ring during a match. Ferdinand is slashed and threatened with spears; he also charges a bullfighter and sends him flying into the air (no blood; the man appears shortly after, unharmed). Ferdinand's friends grimly sum up what happens to bulls: Either they die in the ring or go to the \"chop shop\" (a tense rescue scene takes place in the latter, with dangerous machines and many near-misses). Heroic characters talk about fighting for \"glory.\" At one point, Ferdinand's dad leaves for a match and never returns, leaving Ferdinand to call after him and weep. In several scenes, Ferdinand runs amok after being frightened or hurt; he knocks things over and butts people with his horns; at other times, Ferdinand protects smaller animals and a baby.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lupe the Goat has a few lines with mild innuendo: e.g., looking over Ferdinand's bottom, she says, \"A plus on the flank, mama likey!\" in an admiring way.\n|Language|: No cursing, but Ferdinand and other bulls who aren't tough and aggressive are frequently called names like \"flower boy,\" \"soft,\" and \"puny bag of bones.\" Bulls are also called \"loser\" and \"dork.\" Also \"sucks,\" \"dumb,\" \"stupid,\" and some crude humor, as when Lupe says that a group of bulls will be so surprised to see Ferdinand that they'll \"fertilize the lawn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film, but plenty of offscreen merchandising.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776832999c64001ec2ebea": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ferris-buellers-day-off", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a beloved teen comedy from director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club). While it's about skipping school -- with almost no negative consequences (something families may want to discuss) -- it's also charming and clever. Expect frequent profanity (including \"s--t\" and a use of \"f--k\") and manipulative and rule-breaking behavior from the main character (who lies, shows off, and steals a car), as well as some kissing/making out, a teen looking at an illustration of a nude woman on a computer, scuffles between characters, and background smoking and drinking. Mostly, the movie glorifies defying authority, though Ferris (Matthew Broderick) and his friends also show curiosity and moments of teamwork. The majority of the cast are White, with Black characters stereotyped in supporting roles, and sexist behavior is normalized. While it's a little edgy, older tweens and up will likely enjoy the energetic, carefree quality and understand that similar behavior in real life would have less positive outcomes.\n|Positive Messages|: Friendship and believing in yourself are strong themes, and there are positive aspects to the idea of living life to the fullest. Frequent rule-breaking is celebrated and played for laughs, with main character never facing the consequences of his actions. Questioning authority is mostly used as an excuse to have fun, but also helps a character develop the confidence to stand up to an oppressive parent.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main teen characters lie, cheat, steal, and cut class with abandon, and the movie largely excuses their behavior as standing up to unfeeling adults. Ferris can be rude and manipulative, even toward his friends, but he also shows love and loyalty. He's clever and creative, though he mostly uses those attributes for personal gain. Both Mr. Rooney and Ferris' sister are driven by a desire to expose his behavior, but their vengeance doesn't pay. Others around Ferris learn and grow, yet he doesn't change.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Characters are primarily White and middle- to upper-class, with Black characters shown only briefly in stereotypical ways, including as part of a dance troupe. A character asks an auto repair man whether he speaks English, making presumptions about his origin based on his job and perceived social standing. A character uses negative language surrounding mental health, including \"psychotic\" and \"out of your goddamn mind.\" Sexist behavior includes a man saying a teen girl wears too much makeup and that people think his sister is a \"whore\" for doing the same. An additional incident sees a character tell another to \"be a man.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scuffles; an adult is attacked by both a snarling dog and a teen, during which he's kicked in the face and passes out. A car falls from a height and is smashed. A dog is poisoned with flowers and appears dead. Passing mention of suicidal thoughts, bleeding from the eyes, a kidney transplant, and a grandmother's death. A character pretends to lose consciousness underwater; an incident of dangerous driving.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Occasional kissing/making out, references to seeing a girl change before she goes swimming (nothing shown), a woman dressed as a nurse delivers a racy \"candygram.\" Ferris looks at an illustration of a nude woman on a computer and appears to enlarge her breast size. Passing mention of herpes.\n|Language|: Fairly frequent profanity includes \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"s--thead,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"bastard.\" One use of \"f--k.\" \"Piss,\" \"goddammit,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"slut,\" \"whore,\" \"d--khead,\" \"dips--t,\" \"Christ's sake,\" \"blow yourself,\" and use of the middle finger.\n|Products & Purchases|: Ferrari brand is referred to and shown on-screen frequently as desirable and aspirational.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Background drinking/smoking during a restaurant scene.

Some positive messages about tolerance and believing in yourself go along with a bit of strong language (\"s--t\" and \"son of a bitch\"). There are a couple references to past drug use, as well as a couple tense scenes.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a story about following your dreams, even if everyone thinks you're crazy. Reconnect with loved ones any way you can.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ray and his wife are under a lot of financial stress, but they take the time to listen to their young daughter when she suggests what they should do to earn income. Annie speaks out against closed-mindedness and censorship, and is not afraid to ruffle some feathers in the process.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Main character hears ghostly voices and sees things that other people cannot see.

James' best-selling erotic romance novels originally written as Twilight fan fiction. As anyone who's seen the first movie or read the books knows, this is not an appropriate movie for teens. It's filled with sex and has many graphic love scenes, including close-up shots of naked breasts and buttocks and glimpses of pubic hair. In fact, the central couple -- whose relationship started out unhealthy but now has turned into love -- seems to do little else but have sex; at least this time around, the steamy scenes are less violent and more loving. That said, this installment features more out-of-the-bedroom violence than the first movie: There's a scene of gun violence, a helicopter crash, and a near sexual assault. Language is also strong, with words like \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and \"a--hole\" used frequently. Character drink frequently, and there's lots of brand/product placement, especially luxury cars, electronics, and jewelry.\n|Positive Messages|: A key takeaway is to stay firm in your sense of self; don't give up who you are for someone else. Also encourages acknowledging the difficult or disturbing aspects of your past and processing them so you can move forward with your life and relationships in a healthy way.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ana is stronger willed in the second movie than she was in the first. She's secure in herself and sure of what she wants out both of a relationship and a career. Christian is more flexible and not quite as controlling. He listens to Anastasia and is willing to compromise and discuss what it means to be in a relationship of equals, as opposed to one with dominant and submissive roles.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Unlike the violence in the first film, which was limited to the bedroom, this installment includes gun violence in one scene -- an intruder shoots a gun in Anastasia's direction -- and a scene of potential sexual violence that ends with Anastasia defending herself by hurting the man who's about to assault her. A helicopter crashes, and it's unclear for a little while what happens to the pilot and passenger. A character throws a drink in another character's face. A character slaps another person.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many long, explicit sex scenes with nudity (mostly bare breasts and buttocks, but also occasional glimpses of pubic hair -- though no full frontal as in the first film). Portrays light bondage and submission/domination scenarios, as well as oral sex and the use of several sex/novelty toys/aides. It feels like there are more sex scenes in this film than in the first one, since Ana and Christian are together for more of this movie.\n|Language|: Several uses of \"f--k,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"Jesus Christ\" and \"my god\" used as exclamations, plus some \"dirty talk.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of Audis, plus Cartier ring, iPhone, Apple computer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink wine, beer, and cocktails at various receptions, dinners, and events.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b9896b655001fe16520": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fifty-shades-freed", "cs_age": 18, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 18+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Fifty Shades Freed is the final installment in the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, movies based on E.L. James' best-selling erotic romance novels originally written as Twilight fan fiction. Like the other two movies, it's an erotic drama with more bedroom action than pretty much anything else. Like Twilight's Breaking Dawn, Fifty Shades Freed starts with the main characters' wedding and then follows the sex-fueled newlyweds as they navigate external pressures -- but mostly just find ways to have sex anywhere they go. There are many explicit sex scenes, including extreme close-up shots of naked breasts and buttocks and glimpses of pubic hair -- as well as multiple sexual accessories and toys. The language is also strong, with \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and other words used frequently. Characters also drink often (appearing drunk in a couple of scenes), and there's lots of brand/product placement, especially luxury cars (Audi in particular) and electronics. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: The strongest message is that marriages/romantic relationships require a partnership between equals. Although chemistry/attraction is important, it's also essential that the people involved work together to compromise and support each other. Christian's story also encourages dealing with the difficult/disturbing aspects of your past and moving forward.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ana is more outspoken than in the past when it comes to being an equal in her marriage. She's now more secure in herself and sure of what she wants, both out of marriage and in her career. She reminds Christian that marriage is about compromise, trust, and working through problems. Christian is still slightly controlling and jumps to jealous conclusions, but he ultimately listens to and respects Anastasia. Ana and Christian's close friends/family are supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Similar violence levels as in the last movie. There's gun and knife violence: An intruder holds Anastasia at knife point, and a man kidnaps a woman and holds her hostage, bound and gagged. A man forcefully slaps and kicks a woman to the point of unconsciousness. A character shoots another. Bodyguards point their guns at an attacker and apprehend him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many long, graphic sex scenes that show everything other than complete full-frontal nudity (i.e., bare breasts, lots of close-ups of nipples, shots of buttocks, and also occasional glimpses of pubic hair). These explicit scenes portray consensual light bondage and submission/domination scenarios, as well as oral sex and the use of various sex/novelty toys/aides.

James (which began its life as Twilight fan fiction). It shouldn't surprise anyone who has read or heard about the popular book (and its sequels) that it's not at all appropriate for teens and features an unhealthy relationship between an inexperienced college graduate and a 27-year-old billionaire with a bondage/dominant-submissive (BDSM) fetish. The adults-only drama is filled with graphic sex scenes, most of which include close-up shots of naked breasts, buttocks, and even glimpses of genitalia (though they're all just shy of being completely \"full frontal\"). Although the sex scenes are consensual, many involve hitting and being tied up, and there's a potentially disturbing scene in which Christian \"punishes\" Anastasia, hurting her so much she weeps. The language is also strong, with words like \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and \"a--hole\" used frequently, and there's frequent drinking and lots of brand/product placement. Note: This review is of the R-rated version of the film shown in theaters, not the unrated cut released on DVD; the latter contains additional mature content.\n|Positive Messages|: A key takeaway is to develop a strong sense of self esteem so you don't compromise in your relationships. Although Ana starts the movie insecure and upset, she ends it knowing what she does and doesn't want out of her romantic relationship with Christian.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ana's roommate encourages her to take things slow and \"at her own pace\" with Christian; Ana starts the movie as an insecure virgin but later discovers her own boundaries, desires, and limits when it comes to a sexual relationship.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Although their activities are consensual, Christian spanks and hits Ana, usually too lightly to be truly painful but still hard enough to leave a mark. In one scene, Christian hits Ana (with her consent) six times so hard that she cries and leaves, horrified and upset.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Like the book, the movie includes several explicit sex scenes with nearly full-frontal nudity (always breasts and buttocks, and occasionally shots of pubic hair, too). Most of the sex scenes (all of which show Christian opening a condom) involve the use of Christian's ties, eye masks, and other sex toys/bondage aides like whips, chains, handcuffs, ropes, and feathers. Christian and Anastasia walk in on her roommate having sex on a couch; she's wearing a negligee, and her partner's jeans are pushed down under his butt.\n|Language|: Many uses of \"f--k,\" both in the sexual sense and as a declaration; also \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Featured brands (some very prominently) include Audi, Mercedes, LG, Apple iPhone, MacBook Pro, Volvo, and the Heathman Hotel.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of wine drinking throughout the movie (and incorporated into one sex scene).

Impressionable kids and teens are likely to miss the dark satire while witnessing numerous examples of graphic beatings, vandalism, shootings, and bombings. The overall cloud of nihilism permeating this movie, the lead character's attempts to place subliminal one-frame shots of pornography in family movies in a theater where he works as a projectionist, scenes in which characters who work in restaurants urinate in food, a scene in which the female lead, after engaging in loud and passionate sex, says, \"I haven't been f--ked like that since grade school,\" as well as the aforementioned graphic violence, make this best for audiences mature enough to see the film's deeper messages on the ways in which consumer culture warps our individuality and self esteem. There's also frequent profanity, nudity, smoking, and drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: The plot is pretty much an album of calculated, anti-social acts, from pointless brawls and hazing to impersonating leukemia victims and organized vandalism sprees, all explained as rebellion against a desolate consumer society.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lead male character driven to psychosis by the tedium of contemporary society. Meets female lead character at cancer support group meetings, where they both go to vicariously observe the suffering of others. Lead character begins to believe that fighting is a solution to the emasculation of contemporary society, which leads to vandalism and more extreme acts of terrorism.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As the title implies, frequent fighting between men, under the pretense of reclaiming their masculinity and getting in touch with the primal in a sterile consumer society. Faces beaten and bruised, including one man's face beaten until pulpy and covered in blood. Members of the \"fight club\" are told to start a fight with a total stranger in public. Threats of and actual suicide by gun to mouth. Car crash after character stops steering and allows the car to careen into oncoming traffic before crashing into a ditch. Acts of urban vandalism result in the death of one of the characters, shot by a police officer and shown bleeding out the back of his blown-out head. Graphic scene in which scalding acid is burned on character's hand as a test of strength as the character screams and writhes in intense pain. Character has visions of a plane crash. Skyscrapers detonated by planted explosives.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters have loud and passionate sex. Nudity: Female breasts, male buttocks. The female character says she \"hasn't been f--ked like that since grade school.\" Much talk of the breasts that grew on a male supporting character because of hormone treatment. While working as a projectionist in a movie theater, one of the characters splices in frames of pornography into family entertainment, one frame shots of penises; this is done in the actual movie at the very end. Reference to sex toys.\n|Language|: After sex, a female character says she has \"not been f---ked like that since grade school.\" \"S--thole.\" F-word used several times.\n|Products & Purchases|: Addresses and satirizes materialism and commercialism, and how consumer culture is, for many Americans, linked to self esteem.

This time, instead of a parent searching for a child, the story revolves around Dory looking for her family. Like most Pixar movies, there are some very emotional moments, including an early montage in which young Dory -- separated from her parents (a situation that may very well upset younger kids) -- searches the ocean for them ... until she forgets what she was looking for. There are other stressful separations between friends, too, as well as some peril and tense moments (like a predator giant squid the characters need to get away from and action-packed escape antics), as well as slapstick and near misses. But in the end, the \"happily ever after\" adventure is still appropriate for viewers of virtually all ages, and Dory's story is ultimately uplifting, as is the movie's treatment of her disability, which is never ignored. Finding Dory's themes of teamwork, perseverance, family, friendship, and unconditional love are relatable for even the littlest kids. (Tip: Be sure to watch through the end of the credits to see the extra scene featuring friends from the first film!)\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn about the various marine animals featured in the movie -- like the fact that sea otters cuddle, that octopi \"ink\" themselves when threatened (and have three hearts), that loons imprint, etc.\n|Positive Messages|: Parents never give up on their kids. Home is more than a place, it's wherever your family/loved ones are. Family and close friends don't let you just \"go,\" and they love you unconditionally. The movie also makes it clear that disabilities don't define you, that you learn how to live with them (whether it's Dory's memory loss or Nemo's small fin). Teamwork and collaboration are also promoted, as it's the only way Dory and Marlin/Nemo accomplish their missions.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dory perseveres in her mission despite her short-term memory loss. She enlists help and brainstorms ways to problem solve based on instinct and whatever her present circumstances are. Marlin and Nemo help Dory even though it puts them at risk, and they won't stop looking for her because she's family. Dory's parents are supportive and loving and made thoughtful decisions in case she forgot her way and might eventually make her way back to them. The supporting creatures help the protagonists in various ways. Teachers are wonderful and caring.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some emotional, potentially disturbing scenes/sequences. Early in the movie, young Dory, separated from her parents, looks for them all over the ocean (until she forgets what she was looking for). Peril and danger: A giant squid grabs Nemo and tries to eat him; Marlin and Nemo must temporarily struggle, without water, to cross a courtyard; Dory's friends think she's been eaten, but she's just being hugged. The aquarium transport truck drives wildly and gets into an accident, but no one appears injured. Some slapstick moments and other near misses, as well as additional separations between friends, some of which are upsetting.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: No swearing, but some substitutes for curse words (i.e., instead of \"crap,\" Hank uses \"carp\").

Expect a little potty humor amid the movie's messages of teamwork, determination, loyalty, and a father's never-ending love for his son. The issue of Nemo's stunted fin is handled exceptionally well -- matter-of-factly but frankly.\n|Educational Value|: Though not intended as an educational movie, kids will pick up facts about sea creatures and perhaps an interest in learning more about the ocean.\n|Positive Messages|: Diverse characters get along well, and a disabled character is brave and capable. A father searches tirelessly for his son and learns a lesson in letting go and letting him grow up.

Expect to find even more adult content in the unrated DVD. This crude comedy about two lust-driven teen boys is full of boundary-pushing sex and language content. The main characters are surrounded by -- and happily ogle -- hundreds of girls clad in the shortest of shorts and tiniest of bikinis. Boys are shown naked from both the back and front (private parts are covered by towels, etc. in the latter case). Though actual physical contact is limited to kissing and a few scenes of \"grab ass,\" the characters are constantly talking and thinking about \"hooking up.\" Not surprisingly then, the language can get vulgar and sexist -- and it's also peppered with \"s--t\" and the like. Underage characters drink, and there's some same-sex kissing and fondling; many of the gay characters are played very stereotypically, though it's all meant to be funny rather than disrespectful.\n|Positive Messages|: Lecherous teen boys learn about caring and respect for the opposite sex -- but along the way their behavior is selfish, egotistical, and driven by their very randy urges. \"Winning\" is shown to be far less important than improving and doing the best you can.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main characters are selfish and obsessed with sex, though they do eventually mend at least some of their ways. There's also plenty of stereotyping.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several punches to the face; football hits during a game; cheerleaders fall and hit the ground hard during practices -- no injuries.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: From the movie's opening moments to its final frames (including under the closing credits), raunchy teenage behavior is the focus of this film. There's enthusiastic kissing and passionate embracing throughout. Teen boys constantly ogle bikini-clad girls, girls in short shorts, and other girls of all shapes, sizes and ethnicity. There's no frontal nudity or bare breasts, but naked boys are seen from many angles on several occasions. Boys and girls grab each other's clothed butts. Same-sex female kissing in two scenes, and some gay and lesbian fondling.

Georgia (voiced by Olivia Cooke), is a 16-year-old girl in 1920s New York who wants to follow in her former-firefighter father's footsteps and join the force -- something that is forbidden at the time. When a series of arson attacks persuades her father -- Captain Nolan (Kenneth Branagh) -- out of retirement, she disguises herself as a boy so she can help solve the mystery. The movie is dedicated to real-life female firefighters and celebrates perseverance, encouragement, and teamwork. Georgia's father is protective of her but caring and calm in a crisis. He is a great leader who brings out the best in his team. The arson mystery has twists but is easy to follow. The peril is low as rather than fire, a glowing chemical is used so scenes aren't as distressing as they could be. There are mild scenes of threat but they are more exciting than worrying. One conversation involves a baby's parents dying in a fire -- an integral part of the plot -- which is handled sensitively.\n|Educational Value|: The movie ends with the real-life history of female firefighters in New York City and the credits feature photos of female firefighters from around the world. Kids can also learn about some of the training involved in becoming a firefighter.\n|Positive Messages|: Firefighters show great teamwork. A girl perseveres to realize her dream of being a firefighter, despite it not being a job for women at the time. Characters are courageous, empathetic, selfless, respectful, and encouraging to each other. They have to display self control to remember their training in a crisis.\n|Positive Role Models|: Georgia Nolan is a 16-year-old girl who has always wanted to follow in her former-firefighter father's footsteps. She is persistent, headstrong, and determined to the point of pretending to be a boy to join a firefighting team. Captain Nolan brought up Georgia as a single father and is protective of her. He became a tailor to lead a less dangerous life but is persuaded to return to firefighting when a serial arsonist strikes. He is a great leader who brings out the best in his team. A small team of firefighters work together, encourage each other, and show each other respect. Supreme Fury is a villain who launches arson attacks with a mysterious chemical that causes firefighters to go missing. They believe they are working for good but go about it in a destructive way.\n|Diverse Representations|: Set in the United States in the 1920s, the term \"fireman\" is used rather than \"firefighters\" as a large plot point is that women aren't allowed to do the job. The movie's characters are from diverse backgrounds and voiced by appropriate actors. The characters avoid stereotypes. The term \"loony bin\" is used. A family unit consists of a daughter and a single father.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Arson attacks are shown. But they use a chemical rather than fire, so the peril is somewhat diluted. Threat includes people dangling from height. Some knockabout slapstick. Reference to parents dying in a fire.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Some use of \"bum\" and \"butt.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683b7228e5001f1df92c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fireproof", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that a powerful grassroots marketing campaign has helped turn this Christian-themed indie drama about a fireman with a troubled marriage into a hit. While the content is age-appropriate for older tweens and up, the marriage-centric story isn't likely to interest them. The plot includes mention of online porn (it's frowned on, of course), but viewers don't really see anything salacious. Marriage is portrayed as tough and often devoid of love, affection, or respect, but something that Christians are expected to endure anyway. Non-Christian viewers might be uncomfortable with some of the movie's dialogue and themes; on the flipside, at least it skips some of the raw language and sex in other Hollywood firefighting movies (like Backdraft).\n|Positive Messages|: Caleb -- who's a courageous lifesaver in his day job but not very humble about it -- rises above his personal flaws to be a better person, even it it's too late for his marriage. Some diversity among characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An offscreen car wreck yields maimed victims; perils of an impending train crash.

It's set during the tumultuous decade leading up to Armstrong's historic Apollo 11 moon mission. Ryan Gosling stars as Armstrong, the smart, brave, determined, extremely stoic engineer-pilot-astronaut who persevered to eventually become the first person to walk on the moon. Along the way, he and NASA must weather life-threatening situations including mission failures, dangerous test flights, and even the death of valued team members -- but this is more of an artful character study than an Apollo 13-style thriller. Expect social drinking, chain smoking, infrequent but memorable swearing (including \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and one \"f---ing\"), and several tense, sad scenes of characters in peril. A child's death isn't shown, but the impact is clear. Claire Foy co-stars as Armstrong's wife, Janet, who has a larger role here than many \"NASA wives\" in similarly themed films. Some scenes were shot with a handheld camera in a way that can be jarring.\n|Positive Messages|: Celebrates traditionally American values such as competition, pioneering spirit, courage, teamwork, hard work -- all of which came into play to win space race to moon. Shows how Armstrong's quiet strength, determination helped make Apollo 11 a successful mission. Perseverance, humility are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Armstrong is a smart, courageous, determined engineer, pilot, and astronaut. He loves his wife and children but is also focused on NASA mission. The astronauts are supportive, encouraging, even though they're also competing for spots on the moon mission. Janet is a kind, patient, caring wife and mother.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several deaths due to mission/equipment failures -- most take place off camera. In one case, lead-up to the deaths is shown, with astronauts worrying, yelling for help as fire breaks out. Tense scenes in which astronauts in space have to overcome difficulties that could have life-threatening consequences. A child's death is implied; her small coffin is shown during a funeral.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple dances, embraces, kisses.\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes \"holy s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"screw,\" \"jackass,\" \"hell,\" \"Jesus Christ!,\" and one \"f---ing.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Budweiser, Busch beer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink beer at a couple of get-togethers/dinners.

Since the guideline for CF patients is that they should stay a minimum of six feet apart from each other due to the danger of cross-infection, the title refers to the one foot the pair \"take back\" to be a tiny bit closer as their love story develops. Language isn't frequent but includes a use of \"f---ing,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" etc., and a few references to sex (or lack thereof). Will and Stella aren't supposed to touch, much less kiss (saliva exchange would be deadly, as one of them has a serious bacterial infection), so there's no sex, although they do undress down to their underwear in one romantic scene. The movie, which had a CF consultant, has been divisive within the CF community; some members are happy to see more awareness for the disease, which affects about 30,000 in the U.S., and others worry that the movie romanticizes the illness or misleads able-bodied audiences. Ultimately, the story promotes treasuring those closest to you and has themes of perseverance and empathy.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't take life for granted. Grab love and joy wherever you can find them, and treasure those closest to you, because you don't know when death will come calling. Strong element of \"if you love someone, set them free.\" Themes also include perseverance, empathy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although cystic fibrosis community is split on some aspects of movie, there's agreement that this is one of the few movies to even attempt to represent what it's like for teens living with CF (or something other than cancer). Stella, who also has OCD, is diligent about her treatment schedule, craves order. She's caring, loving to her parents and close friends. Will is edgier and has less discipline, but he's artistic and loving and wants to live each day to its fullest. Poe is a caring, selfless friend. The nurses are patient, dedicated, empathetic.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A young man looks like he's perched precariously on a hospital roof and might fall. (Potential spoiler alerts ahead.) A young character who dies of cystic fibrosis is briefly shown coding, then dead on the floor. A character who looks to have died is saved via CPR. Sad conversations about loved ones who've died (and how they died).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of yearning looks and one scene in which Stella touches her chest sensually in front of Will after they both declare they could touch each other. They also undress down to their underwear and jump into the hospital pool together but don't touch purposely. They hold gloved hands. A couple of cases of asexual accidental touches, both in times of stress or emergency.\n|Language|: Occasional use of strong language, including one \"f---ing,\" plus \"bitch\" and a couple uses of \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"boobs,\" \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The AfflowVest, a branded mobile mechanical oscillation therapy device used by CF and other chronically ill pulmonary patients, is prominently featured.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e16332510faa500400d98c7": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/flora-ulysses", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Flora & Ulysses is a quirky, kid-friendly story about a superhero squirrel. Based on the book by Kate DiCamillo, it has dramatic elements involving separated parents and action scenes played for humor. Ten-year-old Flora (Matilda Lawler) has become cynical as a result of her parents' struggles. She says that the hardest part of not having hope is watching people -- namely, her parents -- who once did have hope and no longer do. Flora demonstrates perseverance in pushing through the hard times thanks to a newfound conviction in Ulysses' superpowers. The squirrel, while adorable, causes mayhem and destruction wherever he goes, including tearing apart a diner and destroying a dining room. The animal control agent who's trying to capture Ulysses shoots tranquilizer darts randomly at Flora and other characters, hitting one multiple times. It's also said that Ulysses will need to be euthanized to test his brain tissue for rabies. A man nearly crashes his car with two kids in it, and a car door is ripped off. A temperamental cat attacks people, and Flora's friend William (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) declares that his blindness must have been \"hysterical\" after it abruptly goes away. Flora's mom (Alyson Hannigan) writes romance novels, and some sensual book covers are framed on her walls. She and Flora's dad (Ben Schwartz) share an awkward hug and later kiss.\n|Educational Value|: Kids could be inspired to hold onto their artistic and creative dreams, even if they come up against roadblocks.\n|Positive Messages|: Superheroes have a purpose -- usually liberty, freedom, or revenge -- and they help others. Families and friends help each other through rough times. Being cynical and \"seeing what's real\" means you can miss out on magic and hope.\n|Positive Role Models|: Flora demonstrates perseverance in her determination to save and believe in Ulysses, and in her parents. She's very independent, walking around town on her own, selling off old comic books for cash. Her parents, separated, are both facing writer's block, both adrift and struggling. Flora's family welcomes William. It's said that a character played by a sighted actor has been blind since a traumatic incident; he (spoiler alert) abruptly regains his sight and declares that his condition must have been \"hysterical.\" Principal cast members are White; supporting cast includes some actors of color.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of mayhem and disruption involving Ulysses the squirrel: He's sucked into a vacuum, and Flora performs CPR to save him. He destroys inside and outside of a diner and dining room. A temperamental cat attacks people. Flora says her mom killed her hamster when she hit it with a pan. We learn that William pushed a car into a lake, which got him sent away for a summer. Miller shoots animals and humans with tranquilizer darts; kids are within his line of fire. He says a squirrel will need to be euthanized to test its brain tissue for rabies. A car door breaks off while kids are inside, and mention is made that one of them later fell out at a turn. The same car nearly has a head-on collision with a bus.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Phyllis writes romance novels; book covers, some of them sensual, line her walls. She can't think of a synonym for \"steamy\" while writing. A separated man and woman share an awkward hug, then kiss at the end of a movie. Another adult couple comes close to kissing.

Not surprisingly, considering the title, it's got lots of potty humor: The storyline revolves around a rat being flushed down a toilet into a sewer, and there are references to human waste, including one scene in which a character appears to grab a piece of excrement. Lots of cartoon violence, too: Characters fall from high places and are shot at, chased, frozen, electrocuted, yelled at, and threatened. Toad is an evil villain, and Sid is a disgusting character who belches, farts, and is generally crude. On the other hand, Rita is an independent girl who can fend for herself.\n|Positive Messages|: Sid flushes Roddy down the toilet. Toad hates rodents and wants to flush them out of the sewer (i.e. kill them). Scenes of farting, belching, name-calling, and general rudeness. Rita threatens to abandon Roddy in his hour of need. Toad will do anything to steal a precious jewel belonging to Rita. Reference to \"screaming like a girl.\" Decent message about expanding your horizons and living life to the fullest.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Roddy takes a wild ride down the toilet, gulping for air (he can't swim). He and Rita flee in her boat from villains while being shot at and threatened. A character gets \"zapped\" when the toaster he's riding falls into the water.

But it isn't just a romantic comedy, it's also a treasure-hunting adventure that features a few unexpectedly violent scenes. In fact, there's more violence than romance, which is limited to a couple of scenes of passionate kissing. There's also some language (\"s--t,\" \"bitch\") and drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: Finn prioritizes treasure hunting over being a responsible adult. Gemma is a rich bimbo stereotype. Tess seems more interested in Finn's body than anything else.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Finn is held at gunpoint and thrown tied to an anchor into the ocean. Several characters are shot at, and one dies from the shooting. Another character is taken hostage. Someone is pushed out of a flying helicopter into the ocean. Moe punches Finn in the face. Another character also dies in the water, which turns red.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Finn is almost always shirtless.

Segel is shown completely naked: It's brief, but we see his penis and buttocks. The movie derives much of its humor from showing or making reference to casual sex and various sex acts. In one montage, Segel's character has one-night stands with a variety of women, breasts shown. In another montage, two honeymooners are shown attempting sex in a variety of ways -- no nudity, but a lot of comical yelling and moaning. Casual sex, group sex, and masturbation are all referenced as one-liners. There's a topless picture of one of the lead female characters that is taped to a men's room wall in a bar; the lead character is shown beaten and bruised after fighting the bar owner after removing the picture from the wall. Attempted oral sex is shown and graphically discussed. Profanity is frequently used, including \"f--k\" and variations. Characters binge-drink -- beer, wine, cocktails -- and get extremely drunk, and make drug references. However, there's also a thoughtful message and reflection -- as comically exaggerated as it may be -- on the heartbreak, sadness, and difficulties everyone faces at some point after the end of a failed relationship, and how people find a way to try again.\n|Positive Messages|: Couples cheat on each other and cover up their misdeeds with lies.

Topless photo of a lead female character. Main character is later shown having tons of one-night stands; naked breasts. Attempted oral sex. Simulated sex acts in various positions. Couples cuddle post-coitus under sheets. A man teaches another man -- who is inexperienced -- his sexual tricks by humping large chess pieces. A honeymooner laments his new bride's excessive sexual demands, complains about not being able to find part of a woman's anatomy.

Parents may want to preview the movie for its realistic treatment of serious issues like abuse, the Civil Rights movement, drugs, and war.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie stresses the importance of family, friendship, and loyalty. Some historic events and figures are questioned but generally not in too much detail. Serious issues like child abuse and war are addressed. Other major themes include gratitude, integrity, and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Forrest, through his extreme naivety and big heart, seems to bring out the best in people. He stumbles into much of his good luck serendipitously, but he also works hard and devotes himself to whatever he's focused on.

The McDonalds are principled visionaries, albeit purists who get in the way of their own dreams.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Confrontations/yelling about both business and personal issues.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married man flirts with a married woman and eventually seduces her, off screen.\n|Language|: Language is infrequent but strong; words used include \"f--k\" (once), \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"Christ,\" and \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The film could be considered a feature-length ad for McDonald's.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Social drinking by adults, usually at meals.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776838eb5d26001f1e160f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/four-christmases", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this romantic comedy is riddled with gags centering on major family dysfunction. And there's real bite underneath the laughs: The central couple (played by teen favorites Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn) finds out soon enough that they don't really know enough about each other, and their families beat them up -- both physically and emotionally. It's all played for laughs, of course, which takes some of the edge off, but younger kids may still wind up perturbed by the scenes of familial mayhem. There's also some swearing (including \"s--t\") and social drinking, as well as some innuendo and implied sex.\n|Positive Messages|: Fathers belittle their sons; brothers beat on each other; mothers neglect their daughters in pursuit of their next romance; and a father finally confesses to being a horrible role model. Plus, two people discover they have many more differences than they cared to admit. The lead couple live a Yuppie-fied life in which vacationing in exotic resorts seems to be the main engine of their relationship. Still, even the most awkward situation is mined for humor, and in the end, trite as it may sound, they find their way back to each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of heavy-duty wrestling that, at first, seems purely funny until you realize there's a bullying element to it. Some yelling and screaming. A man falls off the roof clutching an antenna, starting a chain reaction that has the television smashed to bits and a fire igniting on the carpet.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Within the first half hour, a couple indulges in some serious double entendre and then makes out heavily in a bathroom stall; later, it's implied that they have sex (audiences just see them leaving a bathroom looking slightly unkempt). An older woman has a relationship with her son's best friend, and he discusses their sex life. Another woman is involved with a \"rock star\"-like pastor and drops sexual innuendoes, even ones aimed at her daughter's boyfriend. Men openly ogle women's cleavage.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"a--hole,\" \"s--tty,\" and \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Product mentions and placement include Direct TV, Xbox, EPT (pregnancy test), Stanford, jump-jumps, breast pumps, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: There's a fair amount of social drinking; one character seems to spend a lot of time brooding while clutching a beer.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684a7228e5001f1e1529": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-fourth-kind", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sci-fi thriller from director Olatunde Osunsanmi mixes supposedly real footage of alien abductees with re-creations played out by actors (including Milla Jovovich and Will Patton). That mix makes it hard to know what to believe, and it could confuse or mislead overly trusting kids (be ready to talk about telling the difference between fact and fiction). Plus, in addition to an overall sense of dread, there are a couple of shockingly violent moments -- including a bloody stabbing and a blurry scene in which a man kills his wife and children and then himself -- that could scare the daylights out of some viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie aims to suggest that the \"truth\" about alien abductions is out there -- and that it's being covered up -- but it doesn't suggest a healthy or proactive way to go about proving or changing this situation. And if you conclude that the movie is a fake and a put-on, that undermines any kind of positive message it's trying to impart.\n|Positive Role Models|: No real role models here. Dr. Abigail Tyler never really manages to help any of the people who are counting on her, and it's suggested that her behavior is unbalanced. A local cop behaves abhorrently and without much logic, and other characters are either inactive or victimized.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Early on, there's a stabbing with spurting blood. Later, a man murders his wife and children and takes his own life, though the footage is distant and blurry. Some of Dr. Abigail's patients behave violently and unpredictably under hypnosis; some of this behavior is spooky and/or shocking. As for the alien abductions, the movie suggests some of the violence and terror that goes on during them but shows very little.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: During a flashback, Dr. Abigail is seen lying in bed with her husband very briefly (just before he's killed).\n|Language|: Characters keep a lid on particularly strong language (though there are a couple of uses of \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell\"), but many terrified characters exclaim \"God\" in all different kinds of permutations (\"Oh God,\" \"Oh my God,\" \"goddamn it,\" etc.).\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776836880197001ec936f2": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-fox-and-the-hound", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this animal tale develops into a thoughtful examination of friendship and includes some mature themes, especially loss. The movie opens with the (off-screen) shooting death of the fox's mother and he is later abandoned by his human caretaker in a forest to try to keep him safe. There's lots of hunting imagery -- snapping leg traps, pelts -- and a very trigger-happy character named Amos who, after awhile is so bent on catching the fox that he breaks into an animal preserve and tries traps and fire to catch him. The most intense scene involves a ferocious bear chase and a jump from a cliff. Families looking for something for younger viewers with the same cute characters and less violence should try The Fox and the Hound 2.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is based on a book by Daniel P. Mannix. It's also a look at the lives of hunting dogs and foxes. However, when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly after a whole year, it may be worth looking up the real life cycle of butterflies with young ones.\n|Positive Messages|: Shows the power of friendship over the expectations and prejudices of others. There's also a line in a song, \"from our sadness, happiness grew,\" showing that sorrow over loss and loneliness can be a window to new beginnings.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tod and Copper model a dedicated friendship that, even as circumstances push them apart, still has them looking out for each other. Copper at one point is driven by revenge but eventually chooses friendship over it. Amos is shown as trigger-happy and sometimes unusually cruel, but a softer side eventually emerges.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tod is orphaned at the beginning of the movie when his mom runs dogs away from Tod and a gunshot sounds in a field. He's later abandoned in the forest by his human caretaker in hopes that it will save him from getting hunted. Amos is constantly shooting at Tod and seems obsessed with hunting gear -- his shed is full of traps and pelts, and he tries to use a trap on Tod and sets fire to Tod's burrow to fish him out. Chief the dog is hit by a train, falls off a trestle, and breaks his leg -- his eyes close in a stream and it looks like he's died. The fox and the hound have a ferocious fight with a bear ending in a fall off a waterfall cliff. Birds and a caterpillar get electrocuted.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting between foxes and Amos runs out his cabin door in his underwear.\n|Language|: \"Shucks,\" \"dagnabit,\" \"meddling female,\" \"blasted female,\" \"silly, empty-headed female.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683354f42c001f8c4219": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-fox-and-the-hound-2", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this straight-to-DVD sequel made 25 years after the first one is not really a sequel at all. It's a much milder story featuring Tod and Copper, young again, sneaking off to a county fair. Violence is mostly slapstick in nature with a runaway Ferris wheel and cow stampede. The lessons are lighter too, focusing on how to be a good friend and say sorry when you're not.\n|Educational Value|: A small music lesson for little ones about harmony.\n|Positive Messages|: Lessons that friends can come from many backgrounds, in remembering what's important -- friends come first, ambitions second -- and forgiveness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tod and Copper hit a rough patch with their friendship, but make amends and even say they're sorry.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A near miss for a puppy and a truck, a cow is hit by a dart and causes a stampede, and another dog crashes into a barrel, but isn't hurt. Hunting guns discharge mistakenly, repeatedly. Amos ends up with a beehive on his head in one slapstick chase, but seems unhurt. A Ferris wheel tears loose from its moorings and careens through a fair, threatening but not hurting anyone.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Dogs rub up against each other and bat their eyes as shows of affection.

Like most of Burton's films, Frankenweenie's tone is dark and creepy and will likely scare kids who are sensitive to the macabre. On the other hand, this tale of a very young Frankenstein who reanimates his beloved pet dog is a great introduction to the horror genre for older kids and tweens who are ready for some scares -- like when a group of kids reanimates various pets that go wild (one ends up as big as Godzilla) and terrorize the town. Pets die in the movie, and the resulting grief is depicted realistically.\n|Positive Messages|: Science and scientific thought are encouraged, but it's also important to have the right motivation behind a scientific project -- i.e. intention and purpose matter. Victor reveals himself to be a brave and loving friend. Grief over a pet's death is depicted in a realistic manner. Parents support their son, even though they don't fully understand why he made certain decisions.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mr. Rzykruski is a brilliant science teacher who encourages independent thought, study, and observations and helps Victor see the value in working wholeheartedly toward a dream. Victor is sensitive, loving, and smart. He's willing to stop at nothing to help bring his best friend, Sparky, back to life. And later he's brave enough to help save Elsa.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie has a generally dark and frightening tone, augmented by the often-suspenseful music. Most of Victor's classmates are creepy looking, especially the tall and freaky sounding Nassor and the \"children of the corn\" lookalike with her cat that makes prophetic, letter-shaped poop. Several scary sequences, including an invisible reanimated fish that bites and the entire last part of the movie, when reanimated pets, giant sea monkeys, a mummified creature, and a Godzilla-like turtle terrorize New Holland and its townsfolk. Pets die, and other pets turn into monsters that smash and destroy.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Parents hug, a mother reads a romance novel, and Sparky flirts with the neighbor's dog, Persephone.

It's a good movie for families to watch together, as it will spark shared laughter and possible lively conversation about parent-child relationships. There is some very mild sexual innuendo as filmmakers skillfully handle the awkward moments when the teen girl in her mom's body and the mom in her teen's body are confronted with potentially romantic moments with the two male love interests. Occasional swearing is used to help define the characters as they adapt to their new and unfamiliar roles (\"Oh, my God!\" \"We're screwed,\" \"harlot,\" \"hell,\" \"fart,\" \"it sucks\"). Two earthquakes shake things up a bit, but no one is hurt.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids will get lessons about empathy and communication.\n|Positive Messages|: This film is a humorous lesson in seeing the world through another person's eyes. In this instance, a mom and daughter, at odds over values, behavior, and hopes, learn to more fully understand each other and get a solid look at the joys and difficulties each of them faces every day. In one exaggerated comic moment, a young girl says she's going to kill herself -- it's not meant to be taken seriously.\n|Positive Role Models|: Parents are portrayed as conscientious, loving, and having the best interests of their children at heart. Kids are mostly well-meaning as they struggle with the stresses of school and relationships. Rebelliousness is portrayed as an effort to assert individuality. The one teacher in the cast is rigid, unfair, and vengeful. Characters learn and demonstrate self-control, gratitude, and empathy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Earthquakes occur when identities are swapped and unswapped. No injuries. A woman tackles someone to stop him from revealing a secret.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some sweet kisses, a few lingering ones. Because a teen takes over her mother\u2019s body, and her mother takes over her body, there are a few awkward moments when each is confronted with kissing the object of the other's affection. The mom rides on a motorcycle driven by her teen daughter\u2019s crush -- she hugs tight as they speed along.\n|Language|: A few coarse words and insults: \"harlot,\" \"screwed,\"\" \"fart,\" \"insane psycho freak,\" \"hell,\" and some instances of \"Oh my God!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Bernini, Ducati motorcycles, House of Blues, Volvo, Tamburo drums.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne and wine are consumed iin rehearsal dinner and wedding scenes.

It's a tad formulaic and not very edgy (it copies ideas from many other movies), but it's quite likable and cheerful, with positive vibes and plenty of giggles. It's recommended for ages 13 and up. It contains giant-sized video game-type violence, with guns and shooting, explosions, car chases and crashes, fighting, and falling. The main character has a broken nose with some blood shown. Male and female characters kiss, a blonde \"bombshell\" NPC is shown off for her sex appeal (she's designed to be \"arm candy\"), and there's some sexual innuendo and sex-related dialogue. Language includes a use of \"f--k,\" a near use of \"motherf----r\" (a well-placed cut saves the day), and some uses of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" etc. There are some jokey references to other Disney-owned brands.\n|Positive Messages|: Overall theme is about \"finding something more\" to life, which is left pretty vague, but supporting characters take idea of free will to heart, choosing to live outside of prescribed roles. Strong running themes of kindness and nonviolence, as seen in preference of peaceful video game over violent one, in valuing good deeds over acts of violence.\n|Positive Role Models|: Guy pursues and achieves a dream. His decision to do good deeds in a game that celebrates violence is inspirational (he becomes an internet-famous hero). Molotov Girl is shown to be tough and independent. Antwan is viewed negatively for his thievery and love of profits above all else.\n|Diverse Representations|: Diverse group of actors, but the two main characters are White. Guy's Black best friend, Buddy, primarily functions to support Guy, rather than having his own motivations/story. Joke about White character being \"full of White privilege.\" Supporting characters embrace idea of being able to live outside of game-defined roles: A \"blonde bombshell\" NPC, who was only in the game to be \"arm candy\" for male players, chooses not to have a boyfriend, and a barista decides to serve tea.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Large-scale, over-the-top video game-style violence: guns and shooting, explosions, car chases/crashes, fighting, characters on fire, etc. Characters are \"killed\" in the game. Main character's nose gets broken; small amount of blood shown. Characters take lots of falls, battering, crashes, etc. Character smashes computer servers with an ax.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing.

Frosty occasionally loses the magic hat that brings him to life, and of course the small-town kids are sad when Frosty is just an ordinary snowman instead of their friendly, walking, talking pal. Frosty's young friend Karen runs away from home in order to help Frosty, but she truly believes she'll only be gone for a little while and no one will notice. In a few short scenes, Karen is in danger of freezing, and in the saddest scene, Frosty completely melts, and Karen believes he's gone forever -- but it's a family holiday movie, so of course he's not. Parents should also know that this DVD is often paired with Frosty Returns, a loose sequel from 1992 that isn't nearly as fun.\n|Positive Messages|: A brave girl helps her friend Frosty get to the North Pole so he doesn't melt. A villainous magician tries to retrieve his magic hat without caring what happens to poor Frosty without it.

As in many Disney movies, the parents die, here leaving orphaned princesses who must find a way to survive. There are a few other violent scenes that involve men with weapons, snarling wolves, a scary snow monster, a severe storm, and a character who nearly freezes to death. A character falls in love -- twice -- and ends up sharing two kisses at the end of the story. Messages include unconditional love between sisters after a long estrangement, being true to yourself, recognizing your gifts, and not being afraid of your power.\n|Educational Value|: While the movie wasn't created with educational intent, it offers lessons on the importance of family and loyalty, as well as the value of not jumping head first into a romantic relationship.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include compassion, courage, integrity, communication, and self-control. Positive messages about not being afraid of your power and talents, not letting people you love run away, and the importance of figuring out that love demands selflessness and generosity. The love and bonds of sisterhood are emphasized, and the idea of true love taking time to develop is stressed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Anna is a brave, kind, and loving sister. She doesn't give up on her sister, even when everyone else deems her a danger to the kingdom. Elsa, in turn, finally discovers that her power doesn't have to be destructive; it can bring joy, too. Kristoff and Anna teach other that finding the person you love takes more than just one day -- it means overcoming obstacles and sticking by each other during tough times. Olaf is cheerful and loyal.\n|Violence & Scariness|: When they're young, Elsa accidentally hits Anna with her freezing magic and ends up nearly killing her. Elsa and Anna's parents die in a shipwreck; the stormy sea/sinking boat and resulting mourning are briefly seen. Queen Elsa unleashes her magic on the kingdom and plunges it into eternal winter. Vicious wolves chase Anna and Kristoff on a sleigh. Elsa creates a very menacing snow monster and accidentally hurts Anna again. Men with guns and bows try to hurt Elsa. The queen is imprisoned and sentenced to be executed. Anna's heart begins to freeze, and it seems likely her whole body will turn to ice. A severe winter storm unleashed by Elsa's feelings could upset/alarm some younger kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Princess Anna thinks that she's fallen in love with Prince Hans in just a few hours (after some flirting and exchanging of favorite things) and ends up accepting his proposal. Then she spends time really getting to know Kristoff and actually falls in love. Two kisses at the end of the movie. Queen Elsa wears a tight sparkly dress with a high slit.

This time around, the characters undertake a dangerous journey to a mysterious enchanted forest, hoping to discover the source of Elsa's powers. The sisters learn more about their parents' deaths and backgrounds; thanks to several flashbacks, viewers may feel even sadder about the orphans' loss. While there's lots of humor (thanks, Olaf!) and -- of course -- big musical numbers, the sequel is ultimately a bit more intense than the original. Expect perilous (though never graphic) scenes of elemental spirits chasing and attacking Arendelle/the main characters with wind, water, fire, and more. There are also chases, battle scenes with swords, dark secrets, and -- spoiler alert! -- a couple of upsetting (but temporary) deaths. Underlining everything are positive messages about sisterhood, empowerment, acceptance, tolerance, perseverance, and true love, and both Anna and Elsa are examples of strong women who lead confidently and communicate with and support each other.\n|Educational Value|: Although it's not an educational movie, it offers lessons on importance of family and loyalty, of being open to the truth about the past, even when it implicates your own family or ancestors.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include teamwork, courage, perseverance. Positive messages include accepting and getting to know people from different backgrounds, protecting and helping the people you love, knowing how to be supportive, moving past obstacles by \"doing the next right thing,\" acknowledging and understanding history and the past, even if it's uncomfortable and/or problematic. Continues to promote unconditional love, bonds of sisterhood and idea that true love is about partnership, communication, mutual respect, understanding.\n|Positive Role Models|: Anna continues to be a brave, kind, loving sister, as well as a good partner and friend to Kristoff (if somewhat impetuous). Elsa uses her powers to help her kingdom and her loved ones. Both sisters are strong, independent women who lead confidently, communicate with and support each other. Kristoff is a supportive, encouraging partner to Anna and loyal friend to reindeer Sven. Olaf is cheerful, loyal but also thoughtful, philosophical. The people of Arendelle are a diverse group. The Northuldrans have many similarities to indigenous Scandinavian people.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Potential spoilers throughout this section. Several flashbacks to battle that involves weapons (mostly swords), injury, danger, nongraphic death (we're told of one death, and one other person is obviously killed -- they're shown moments before assassination). The sisters find remains of their parents' shipwreck in an unexpected place, which makes them sad; other references to their parents' deaths. Frequent peril and risk: Chases, smashing, panic, falls, etc. Enchanted Forest can be scary: enormous Earth giants are initially frightening (especially when they hurl boulders at people), as is a water horse. Air spirits use a tornado-like cloud to roughly grab, spin main characters. Elsa is repeatedly tossed around by huge waves. Various elemental spirits (air, earth, fire, water) magically threaten Arendelle; the whole kingdom is in danger at a couple of different points; citizens must be evacuated. Billowing smoke and swirling, magical-looking fire that burns quickly and endangers characters. Definite spoiler alert! At one point it looks like Elsa has frozen permanently, and Olaf melts/flurries away as a result (little kids may be quite upset by this, but it's not permanent) -- Anna is extremely sad after that scene.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Anna and Kristoff are a couple, and they show affection for each other several times: hugging, a peck on the cheek, him carrying her, one big kiss and embrace.

There's lots of cartoon violence and peril that may frighten the youngest viewers, including scary thunderstorms, angry bears, and a powerful giant. One story shows three characters who are starving.

One teen character has two moms.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a movie about family and friendship, grief and acceptance, and knowing how to move forward. There are also a lot of valuable lessons about tolerance, looking beyond the superficial, and what it takes to have an open, honest relationship with your parents.\n|Positive Role Models|: In the end, Wren doesn't just go with the flow; she realizes it's Roosevelt, not ultra-popular school heartthrob Aaron Riley, that she wants. She'll also stop at nothing to find her little brother. Roosevelt and his moms have a very honest, communicative relationship. Roosevelt is a smart, by-the-books kind of guy, but he also knows how to step up for those he loves. Albert doesn't talk but has a strong sense of justice and loyalty -- just like the superheroes he idolizes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An amateur MMA fighter threatens a lot of people, kidnaps a little boy, and keeps him locked up. There's a provocation between two muscled bullies and two nerdy teens. Before a full-out brawl starts, there's a \"duel\" in which one guy shoots the other guy's weapon, which happens to be a piece of fried chicken. Albert uses fireworks and other means to thwart those who wrong him. His grown-up friend accidentally sets fire to an apartment and is then pummeled by the very large inhabitants.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few passionate kisses -- two between teens (one couple is shown after obviously having hooked up -- or at least having slept in the same bed together) and others between random couples at a party full of twentysomethings. A single mother's much younger boyfriend has spent the night at their house and kisses her in front of her kids.\n|Language|: Language includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"asswad,\" \"boobs,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"lame,\" \"hell,\" \"sucks,\" \"oh my God,\" etc. There's also a crude joke about how a teen girl has applied Nair to her bottom.\n|Products & Purchases|: Product placements include Mac, Volvo, Hunter boots, Def Jam records, the Beastie Boys album Licensed to Ill, Converse high-tops, Nair hair removal cream, a Porsche, and the movie Animal House.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Partygoers drink and smoke cigarettes. Underage teens drink at a high school party. There's drinking and driving.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776831999c64001ec2e7a6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/fun-with-dick-and-jane", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this comedy includes some cursing and broad physical, occasionally violent comedy.

But it's also an honest, sincere drama about the challenges of modern life. Look past the crude stuff, and you'll see that this is actually a serious, heartfelt film masquerading as a light comedy.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite its crude humor, the movie's messages are actually moving and worthwhile -- about the importance of ethics, the nature and challenge of success, and the way that we often turn pain into laughter even though it doesn't completely eliminate the underlying problem. This isn't a movie about people making jokes -- it's about people making art.\n|Positive Role Models|: While none of the characters in Funny People are anywhere near perfect, that very fact makes them dramatically and morally interesting -- every character in the film at some point has to make a choice about whether or not to do the right thing. Ira makes lots of compromises in the name of money and access, but he questions these things. And George is a self-absorbed success, but his brush with death makes him really think about what it means to be alive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One scene of inept (though enthusiastic) scuffling between two people who clearly don't know how to fight. It's played for comedic effect, but some of the slapping gets pretty serious.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sex scenes involving nude breasts and blunt talk; love scenes; extensive discussion of sex, infidelity, and more.

Like the others, it has tons of over-the-top, outrageous action violence (with the biggest stunts ever for the franchise), including fighting with fists and weapons, car chases/crashes, explosions, gunfire, and character deaths. Women are viewed as objects, frequently appearing in bikinis (women with normal/realistic body types don't appear) -- but the central female characters are also strong and smart. Language isn't constant but does include uses of \"s--t,\" \"bitch\" and one \"f--k.\" Star Paul Walker died during production; his scenes were completed with digital magic and stand-ins. The movie has more focus than earlier installments on the meaning of family, but characters still don't face any consequences for their violent, destructive actions.\n|Positive Messages|: More so than in the previous movies, the characters swear by their \"family\" bonds and vow to protect each other. But their brand of \"teamwork\" usually involves splitting up (and tons of consequence-free destruction). One character leaves his wife and son behind to help out, but eventually learns that his true place is with them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though they've turned into a team of near-superheroes, these guys are still outlaws who cause endless destruction without any consequences. Michelle Rodriguez and Nathalie Emmanuel are strong, smart female role models, even though the movie does objectify them physically. No women whose bodies aren't unrealistically bikini-ready are included in the movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent, outrageous, over-the-top action sequences. Dead bodies. Bombs, grenades, and explosions. Constant car chases and crashes. Fighting with fists and blunt instruments. Bullets fired. Martial arts fighting. Car skewered with tree trunk. Cars falling from cliffs.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Dozens of women are shown in revealing bikinis. Some strong innuendo.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--k,\" and more frequent use of other words, including \"s--t,\" \"sumbitch,\" \"bitches,\" \"goddamn,\" \"damn,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Corona beer is shown and mentioned more than once.

Heads and legs are shot off, gruesome body parts are shown, and there's lots of splattering, flowing blood and hundreds (or possibly even thousands) of dead bodies. A young American soldier disappears into a bedroom with a German girl; they're shown kissing, and sex is implied, but nothing is shown. The men exchange plenty of strong innuendo, and some non-nude girly pictures are shown. Language is quite salty, with several uses of \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" etc. Characters occasionally smoke cigarettes in a background way (accurate for the '40s setting), and in one scene, they share a bottle of what looks like whisky. The movie -- which stars Brad Pitt -- manages to be dramatic and exciting without being preachy, and older teens and parents may come away with their own ideas of what war is really about.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie is largely about teamwork and working together -- although friction among the five men always leads to imbalance and fighting. But the movie also leads viewers to ponder the horrors of war and the wartime attitude that it's perfectly OK to kill your enemies, even if they're human beings with families.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters are skilled, confident soldiers, and they work together as a team, fighting for their country. But since the movie takes place during the final months of WWII, the killing seems more wasteful and damaging than it does heroic. Even though these men may be heroes, parents may want to think twice before offering them up as role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Shocking, realistic violence. Heavy shooting, and high-powered weapons blow off soldiers' heads and limbs. Blood runs everywhere, in splatters and streams. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dead bodies shown; piles of bodies are bulldozed out of the way, and tanks run over dead bodies in the mud. A rookie is made to clean up a bloody mess inside the tank, which includes half of a man's face lying in a puddle of blood. Nazis use children in battle; some are killed. A character is killed with a knife. Dead, hanged bodies are shown. A woman is briefly shown slicing up the carcass of a horse.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An American soldier and a German girl disappear into a bedroom for consensual sex. They kiss, but nothing else is shown. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) is shown shirtless. Occasional strong verbal sexual innuendo. Pinup pictures (non-nude) are occasionally shown inside the tank and in other places.\n|Language|: Strong language includes several uses of \"f--k,\" plus \"son of a bitch,\" \"s--t,\" \"bastard,\" \"a--hole,\" \"t-ts,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"p---y,\" \"whore,\" and \"c--ksucker.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters smoke cigarettes regularly (accurate for the time period).

There's a lot of violence; most of it is played for laughs, but things can get really bloody. Characters use guns, and there's a fight club in which rich people pay poor people to fight each other. One person is hit by a car, someone gets knifed, and a man gets sucked into a jet engine and pur\u00e9ed. Again, all of this is played for laughs, so viewers who can differentiate between comic violence and, say, Scorsese violence can probably handle it. There's also frequent strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" etc.) and some sexual content, including talk about sex acts and fertility treatments and references to a character trying to perform oral sex on himself. Other scenes show kissing/groping, as well as a bit of drinking and smoking. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Underneath the over-the-top comedy is a message about learning to appreciate what's really important, rather than chasing someone else's glory. That said, this movie isn't about imparting life lessons.\n|Positive Role Models|: Annie is brave, smart, and loyal. One of the female guests is probably the smartest person in the movie. Two of the couples are examples of marital bliss. Max displays deep loyalty to his somewhat churlish brother and learns some lessons about what's really important in life. That said, everyone does insane, improbable, and often stupid things because this is an over-the-top comedy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence is played for laughs, but it does get pretty bloody. There's gunplay (both real and fake in the world of the film), with bloody wounds. There's an extended fight scene in a house, a bloody fight-club scene (where rich people pay poor people to fight each other), and a few instances of people being violently struck -- including one person being hit by a car. Someone gets knifed. In one scene, a bleeding wound makes a significant mess. A man gets sucked into a jet engine and pur\u00e9ed. (Again, this is all played for laughs.)\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No sex is shown, but sex acts are discussed -- all to comic effect. Kissing, groping, masturbation joke. A character's attempt at performing oral sex on himself is prominently mentioned. Discussion of sperm in the context of fertility (fertility treatment in general is discussed frankly). Brief mention of body parts in a sexual context. References to promiscuity.\n|Language|: Frequent but not constant strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" \"pr--k,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"son of a bitch,\" plus \"Jesus Christ\" and \"oh my God\" as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Material success is definitely admired in the film, and a particular high-end collector's sports car is fetishized. Certain brand-name games are featured (Jenga, etc.). Tostitos likely had a product-placement deal.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Minor drinking at a party for adults. Quick reference to dealing heroin that isn't explored further.

Lots of people, including young girls, fall and only get minor injuries, and a parent's death is addressed. Peyton runs away to find her father and ends up in some very mildly perilous situations (being left alone at a club, etc.). It's worth noting that although the film makes fun of the insane commercialism of football, it also mentions more than a dozen products, and plugs the Disney Channel and Elvis movies.\n|Positive Messages|: Peyton runs away from home and lies to Karen and Joe. Stella schemes to use Peyton for publicity. Joe forgets Peyton in a club. Joe is initially selfish but eventually learns to share and think of others first -- a great lesson for kids.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of football-related roughness, including sacks, tackles, and close-up shots of Joe being taken down. Joe breaks a rib and hurts his shoulder.

At least eight different products are either mentioned by name by the characters, or the products are gratuitously placed in the scenes or, in the case of Wendy's, a commercial for the product is shown on Jon's television. There some cartoonish pratfall violence. Garfield inadvertently sets off elaborate chain reactions leading to shelves and furniture falling over and getting destroyed. While locked up by Animal Control, a despondent Garfield yells to the guards, asking for shoelaces -- presumably to hang himself.

Mickey, his wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), and his employees are portrayed as smart, sharp, strong, skilled, and generally enviable. Like Ritchie's other films, this one is incredibly violent, with graphic shootings, knives, beatings, a rape, long falls, and lots of blood. Ritchie's values -- hard drugs are stupid, pot is harmless compared to other vices, taxes are out of control, and if you ban guns, then you're defenseless against criminals -- are on his sleeve in this film, but parents may not always agree with them. The script also pokes at political correctness by including words that seem intended to make viewers ask questions like \"Hold up, is that racist? Is that homophobic?\" (in fact, there's a whole conversation about what's racist and what's not). Extremely strong, coarse language includes \"f--k,\" \"c--t,\" and more, a woman fondles her husband over his pants, and there's an off-screen act of bestiality. In other words, this film -- while thoroughly entertaining for adults -- definitely isn't for kids.\n|Positive Messages|: The film definitely has messages, but anything \"positive\" falls into gray areas. For instance, the movie is anti-heroin and cocaine but strongly pro-marijuana.\n|Positive Role Models|: Story is about drug lords, but it portrays them in a counter-stereotypical way. A female garage owner employs mostly female mechanics, is a shrewd businessperson. Mickey may not be the greatest guy, but he's in a loving, committed relationship. Coach trains at-risk boys to keep them off the street, but how he shows them to make amends is iffy. These rare instances are set among a lot of criminal/dodgy behavior.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Opens with someone getting shot in the head. Graphic violence continues throughout: shootings, threats with knives, beatings, lots of blood. Other violence includes poisonings, long falls, a rape.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A woman sensually grabs her husband's crotch. Conversation is layered with innuendo. Off-camera bestiality played for shock and comedy.\n|Language|: Characters curse constantly, especially \"f--k.\" Men frequently call people they don't like \"c--ty.\" Other words include \"a--holes,\" \"c--k\" \"d--k,\" \"piss,\" and \"s--t.\" Frequent use of slurs, including \"Chinaman.\" Sexual terms used to mean something else.\n|Products & Purchases|: Drug lords are rich and talk about deals in terms of nine figures. Money is equated with power and style, which is translated into high-fashion clothing, watches, homes, grills, cars, bars, and cigars.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Film takes place in business world of drug manufacturing, dealing. Characters who do cocaine, heroin, meth are considered lowly, stupid, classless, but pot is considered good, and an argument is made a couple of times that it's harmless. A joint is rolled on camera. All the rich men smoke cigars, often in moments of power and bonding.

Expect some violence (shooting, fighting, an all-out brawl) played for laughs, shock-value nudity (including a brief flash of a penis), other sexy scenes (lingerie, twerking, implied oral sex), lots of swearing (\"f--k,\" the \"N\" word, and more), drinking, and pot use.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid all of the crude humor and stereotyping is the idea not to judge a book by its cover -- or by its class. Also, friendships can start from the strangest situations.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite being materialistic, James is actually well meaning and open to new experiences. Darnell perpetuates a lie but is also quite empathetic. That said, there's plenty of iffy behavior on display throughout the movie that parents wouldn't want kids emulating, as well as lots of stereotypes based on race, gender, and sexual identity (starting with a big chunk of the premise: i.e. James assumes Darnell knows about/has been to prison because he's black).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters point and shoot guns at each other and get involved in a massive brawl. Since one character is \"training\" to defend himself in prison, there are plenty of scenes of him trying to fight others or take a hit himself, pretty much all of it played for laughs.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A brief glimpse of a penis in an extended scene about oral sex that's laced with homophobia.

There's some strong language (including \"s--t\" a few times) and some sexually charged scenes, including one in which a character fantasizes briefly about a ghost giving him oral pleasure and another where a possessed woman writhes around and says \"I want you inside me\" to a male character, who laughs it off.

Friendship is also an important theme, though the friends are far from perfect. Curiosity and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main characters use science and work as a team to save NYC. But Peter Venkman especially is a flawed role model. He and Dana's neighbor Louis both chase women in ways that are now widely recognized as harassment. It's played for laughs, seemingly chalked up to \"boys will be boys.\" Dana winds up receptive to Peter's aggressive advances, which include kissing her on the chest while she's unconscious and a barrage of innuendo-laced comments while he's on this job and she's his client.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: No meaningful diversity, especially among speaking roles, despite setting in ultra-diverse NYC. Ernie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore does get hired as a Ghostbuster midway through the film and doesn't fall into stereotypes about Black men, but he has minimal dialogue. Fatphobia in the form of Slimer, a green ghost whose voracious appetite and rolls of fat are meant to incite disgust in viewers. Casual on-screen ableism -- several disparaging remarks about people being \"crazy\" or \"schizo\" -- is slightly offset by the knowledge that one of the film's writers and leading actors, Dan Aykroyd, is neurodivergent and has Tourette's. Most flagrant is the film's objectification of women, in one case a college student who is hit on by a male professor. Sexual harassment by two men in important roles, including main character Peter Venkman, is played for laughs. Venkman still \"gets the girl\" as if Dana is a trophy to be won.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of blasting from special ghost-busting lasers. A hotel ballroom is destroyed, and another building explodes, with main characters running for their lives. Ghosts take over NYC, many scary-looking (with decomposing skeletal appearances and wicked grins). Two characters are possessed by large dog-like creatures. One has arms and grabs a character through a chair; she screams as she's hurled through the room. A building crumbles; pieces fall on a crowd below, who also almost get smashed by a 50-foot walking marshmallow. Mentions of religious sacrifice. A demi-god attacks with lightning bolts coming from her arms. Dana is possessed and, without her consent, writhes, sensually bares her shoulders and leg, and makes sexual advances on Peter. While she's unconscious, Peter puts her to bed and kisses her clothed chest before leaving. Dana's neighbor follows her down the hallway to her apartment door, repeatedly asking her out and ignoring her polite declines; she has to literally squeeze into her apartment and slam the door in his face. The film doesn't critique the harassment.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A fantasy scene implies Ray receives oral pleasure from a ghost; you see his pants mysteriously unzipped down to his underwear and his eyes cross in pleasure. Dana makes bold sexual advances while possessed, writhing around and showing lots of leg. She even says, \"Do you want this body?\" \"Take me now,\" and \"I want you inside me\" to Peter, who jokes that she already has more than one person inside her. Plus a few kisses and plenty of innuendo, including a joke about getting the Stay Puft Marshmallow \"laid.\"\n|Language|: \"S--t\" is said three times, \"bitch\" once, \"ass\" and other versions a few times, \"pissed,\" \"hell,\" \"mother puss bucket,\" \"schizo,\" and jokes about an EPA official having no \"d--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Coke is seen a few times, a Twinkie is used as a metaphor, and one of the Ghostbusters shouts, \"it's Miller time.\" Cheez-Its and Budweiser are consumed. A montage shows the Ghostbusters on the cover of some prominent magazines like Time and The Atlantic with voices of Casey Kasem and Larry King in background.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of smoking, mostly by Peter and Ray, who often have a cigarette dangling from their lips while catching ghosts. They also share a bottle of hard alcohol after being fired from their jobs and are seen drinking beer a few times. A ghost chugs wine that goes right through him.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77687a23d5a3001f4ecd25": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ghostbusters-2016", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ghostbusters is a reboot of the classic 1984 supernatural action-comedy. This time around, it stars four talented female comedians -- Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones -- as the central quartet who must team up to use their knowledge of science and the paranormal to save the city when New York again faces a supernatural invasion. While the film has some pretty scary spirit baddies and intense ghostly battles -- as well as gross-out slime scenes -- it's so over the top that it's likely to be more engrossing than chilling for most tweens and up. Language is infrequent but includes \"s--t\" and \"damn,\" and one character ogles a character she finds attractive and makes some comments about his hotness (but things never get too racy, and there's less romance/relationship content in this one than in the original). There are also some fart jokes/a hit to the groin, and adults drink beer to relax. It's a lot like the original (watch for cameos from some of the original stars!), but also different in many ways, especially with its underlying theme of female empowerment.\n|Positive Messages|: Scientists save the day, and friendship and teamwork are strong themes. Also, women can do anything men can do -- even subdue the supernatural. Some crude humor.\n|Positive Role Models|: Like first responders, the determined quartet strides straight into danger, their sense of duty calling them to protect the city when everyone else runs in the opposite direction. It's a selfless act, especially after city officials have tried to minimize and downplay their accomplishments. That said, the characters aren't perfect; they have their flaws.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cartoonish sci-fi violence/scares; ghostly apparitions threaten innocent bystanders (particularly freaky are some Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade spooks). Ultimately, a massive specter terrorizes the city, knocking down buildings and throwing vehicles around like toys. Nobody seems to actually be harmed, though some of the images may startle younger viewers -- and one favorite character is blasted out of a window. The main characters use special tools/weapons against their supernatural enemies. Hit to the groin.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some overt (though one-sided) flirting between one of the scientists and the group's receptionist; includes ogling and some comments that border on crude.\n|Language|: Occasional swearing includes \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" and \"butt.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Plenty of brand/product placement, including YouTube, Sony, Vaio, and lots of NYC signage.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters relax with a few beers after a long day.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682b2ec6b5001f6bac01": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ghostbusters-ii", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ghostbusters II is the 1989 sequel to Ghostbusters.

Profanity is infrequent (\"a--hole\" and \"s--t\") and there's some sexual innuendo, including references to \"gynecological exams\" and \"exposing ourselves.\" Sex is implied between two characters who jump up from a couch with their hair messed up and clothes rumpled when someone else enters the room. Cigar smoking is shown, as is wine drinking in an upscale restaurant. In one scene, an infant steps out onto the ledge of a high-rise building and hangs precariously over the edge.\n|Positive Messages|: Kindness and warmth encouraged by the Ghostbusters to all New Yorkers as a way to stop this latest infestation of ghosts, demons, and slime.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters too cartoonish to be seen as positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some demonic imagery, including dozens of severed heads in the subway. A baby in a carriage rolls away from her mother and weaves in and out of NYC traffic. The Ghostbusters crew attacks the slime and the ghosts with laser guns that shoot light and goo. A baby walks out onto the ledge of a high-rise apartment building before being kidnapped by a ghost. Reckless driving.

This installment takes place decades after the events of the original and was written to appeal to kids (including a self-possessed tween girl scientist leading the charge), who don't need to have seen the original to enjoy this one. But longtime fans will be rewarded with a basketful of Easter eggs and cameos from all of the original living Ghostbusters: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts (Egon/Harold Ramis died in 2014). Count on seeing ghosts both funny and fearsome; keep in mind that special effects have improved since 1984, and what didn't scare you as a kid might be more frightening through the lens of modern technology. There are references to virginity (without an explanation of what that term means) and a couple of other sexual insinuations that will likely go over most kids' heads. You can also expect a few swear words (\"a--hole,\" \"s--t\").  Still, this is definitely a more family-friendly film than the original, with themes of friendship, forgiveness, and redemption. Watch through the end of the credits for an extra treat.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of family, friendship, forgiveness, and redemption, as well as courage, curiosity, perseverance, self-control, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Phoebe is a wonderful role model: a self-confident young scientist with ability to regulate her emotions and stay calm in dangerous or potentially upsetting situations. The other three kids use knowledge and skills to battle supernatural creatures and show an immense amount of bravery -- but it does involve driving without a license, disobeying parents/authority figures, and racking up quite a bit of property damage.\n|Diverse Representations|: Most primary characters are White, though the cast includes Black characters who are authority and/or aspirational figures. Both teen and tween boys and girls defy stereotypes: Girls are brave, calm, confident, intelligent. Boys show emotion, creativity, vulnerability.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some ghosts are silly but have menacing abilities. Other supernatural creatures and moments are more frightening, on par with special effects from the original 1984 Ghostbusters; comedic moments help break up the intensity. References to ritualized violence (virgin sacrifices).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Glimpse of teen girl in bra while she's changing clothes. A couple of shielded sexual references (\"third base,\" \"getting to know each other more formally\"). Kissing. Two characters later say \"did we?\" and \"I think we did,\" implying that the kissing led to something more. Attraction and dating between two sets of characters. Mentions of being a virgin, in context of virgin sacrifices, without explanation of exactly what the word means.\n|Language|: Language includes \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"we're screwed,\" \"damn,\" and \"s--t.\" \"Oh my God\" used as an exclamation. The word \"bone\" used to allude to sex.\n|Products & Purchases|: Original Ghostbusters had notable product placement of certain snack foods, and that's winked at here. One scene takes place in a Walmart (lots of products around), and Baskin-Robbins is prominently placed. Characters use YouTube.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A character is shown asleep at a dining room table, with an unmarked bottle and what looks like a wine glass nearby.

While there's plenty of tension, violence is limited to a brief fight, a slap, arguing, dead fish in a pond, and one quick jump-scare. Frequent strong language includes several uses of \"f--k,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and \"s--t.\" A husband and wife kiss and touch, and there are some brief sexual innuendoes/references. Characters drink fairly frequently, but always in social occasions (twice, it seems like people have had a bit too much). Reference is made to a character's former drug problems; she steals and takes a prescription pill from a neighbor. The movie addresses bullying and its long-term impact.\n|Positive Messages|: Presents a very vivid (and rather nasty) view of bullying and the long-term hurt it can cause.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both of the main male characters resort to underhanded, sometimes cruel behavior to get what they want.

While in church, Sara (Austyn Johnson) takes to heart a sermon about the idea that, if someone truly believes in God and His infinite power, then anything is possible. She prays for a dead bird to come back to life, and it does. She's then able to heal others' disabilities and life-threatening illnesses, but ultimately, her personal fate is a sad one. Although it may be clear to Christian audiences and/or adults that her experiences are meant to mirror those of Jesus, kids may not realize without explanation that the movie is trying to demonstrate what Jesus' actions might look like in today's world. Kids may also be set up for confusion and disappointment when their own prayers don't seem to work -- for instance, in bringing a dead pet back to life (as happens in the film, when a dog is depicted lying on the street in blood). Iffy content includes bullying behavior, teens smoking and drinking (out of brown paper bags), and some harsh language, including \"stupid\" and \"hell.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Story revolves around biblical parable about faith as small as a mustard seed moving mountains. In other words, no problem is too big for God to handle.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sara is kind, considerate, demonstrates compassion and humility, acts in service of others. Her family is loving, supportive. Diversity (race, ability) is represented among supporting cast. But in the film's first few minutes, before any characters of color have been positively introduced, a Black teen is shown stealing and is caught by an older White male who roughs him up.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Animal is struck by car (off-camera) and shown dead and bloodied. Physical fistfight. Bullying behavior. A child becomes suddenly ill and dies, perhaps as a result of the energy she's expending to help others.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teen couple has a romantic relationship; a young girl encourages them to kiss.

It's surprisingly sweet and positive, but there's definitely plenty of eyebrow-raising content, including wall-to-wall language, nudity, and randy humor. Women are given powerful, well-rounded roles, with two exceptions: a woman who's sleeping with another character's husband is presented as a one-note \"ho,\" and a white character cluelessly imitates African-American slang despite being told not to. There's some violence: A character hits a coworker with metal objects, punches people in the face, and threatens a man with castration and a broken bottle. There's also an all-out brawl in which faces are smashed repeatedly into bars. Expect tons of jokes about sex and body parts, including a scene in which oral sex is mimed at length. Two men are seen nude in nonsexual contexts, one from the front, and one from the rear. Characters drink nearly constantly and sometimes lose control as a result (literally, in one scene in which women pee on a crowd from above). Language includes \"f--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"p---y,\" the \"N\" word, and more. Essence and Coca-Cola clearly put money into this production: their logos are everywhere.\n|Positive Messages|: Beneath the raunch and silliness is a lot of positivity: loyal friends give love and support (and call each other on their mistakes). A group of women gives thanks for their time together. It's much sweeter and more uplifting than you might expect given the premise and plot. Also raises thoughtful questions about public image vs. private happiness and the value of work/a career. Unabashedly sex-positive in tone.\n|Positive Role Models|: Other characters call Ryan \"the second coming of Oprah.\" She has a successful career and (by the movie's end) a satisfying and authentic personal life. In fact, three out of the four main characters (all of whom are women) have flourishing careers, and all are well-fleshed-out people and loving friends. On the flip side, a woman is presented as being a \"ho\" for posing for provocative social media shots and cheating with another woman's husband. And a white character cluelessly tries to connect with four African-American women by using Urban Dictionary slang, despite being told not to.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dina is aggressive and scary in scenes presented as comedic. She hits a coworker with a toaster and a trash can when he steals her lunch, and she punches several people in the face -- once during an all-out bar brawl. She breaks a bottle and threatens a man with it. She also makes a string of threats to the same man, including throwing hot grits on him and castrating him with her bare hands.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main characters are looking for sex and romance (in that order) during their weekend away, and they find it. Two men are seen nude, one at length from the front and one briefly from the back (both scenes are comic, rather than sexual). Graphic jokes about oral sex (including a running gag about using a citrus fruit as an aid), body parts, and consequence-free casual sex. A man offers women money for sex. One woman is frequently called a \"ho\" and characterized as a home-wrecker. Kissing, joking gropes.\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"p---y,\" \"t-ts,\" \"t--ties,\" \"booty,\" \"sucked off,\" the \"N\" word, \"ho,\" \"d--k,\" and \"c--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The characters' trip is sponsored by Essence; the logo is seen repeatedly on invitations, buildings, signs, pillows, etc., and the Essence annual convention is mentioned several times. The Essence logo is frequently paired with the Coca-Cola logo. Liquor brands are mentioned by name: Bailey's, Hennessey, Patron.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink cocktails, beer, wine, and everything else they can get their hands on. One character orders four shots on a short airplane flight. Characters talk about getting \"white-boy wasted.\" One character buys a bottle of absinthe; she slops it into drinks, and everyone has visions.

Since the novel is commonly used in middle school classrooms, the adaptation will appeal to tweens and teens who've read and loved it. Although there are some fundamental changes from the book (like the age of Jonas, the main character), the movie shares the book's central themes about the things that make life worth living, even if they're painful. The violent revelations are disturbing, especially ugly truths about what it means when citizens (including a baby) are \"released into Elsewhere,\" but the movie isn't nearly as violent as comparable movies like The Hunger Games or Divergent. Like the movie, the book should launch some thoughtful conversations about totalitarianism, freedom of expression, and why utopian societies fail.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's themes and messages echo the book's: how Sameness has eradicated personal expression, how conformity is a threat to individuality, how having no choices for the sake of equality is really oppression, and more. The movie also tackles the tough subject of whether pain is necessary for joy and whether love and heartbreak are preferable to stability and community.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Giver is a complicated character because he seems so sad and unhappy, but it's for an understandable reason. He's patient and teaches Jonas and encourages him to see the world for how it really is.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Jonas punches his friend in the face after a confrontation. Two people await lethal injection. An entire society has no idea that the term \"releasing\" means killing, so when a man \"releases\" a baby, or a group is told they're being \"released,\" no one but Jonas and the Giver know what's happening.

Like its predecessors, this one concentrates on issues of church and state; this time, they revolve around a public university trying to close a controversy-sparking church on campus. Although there's no swearing or sex, characters do flirt, hold hands, and kiss, and there's a scene or two of implied drinking by college-age students (red Solo cups are visible), as well as of an adult drinking beer. And there's some violence, including vandalism that leads to a fire and a dramatic/potentially scary death, plus a man punching a pastor and vice versa. While the movie ultimately has a message of hope and peace, there are also obvious anti-protest/\"social justice\" themes, in that characters claim that protest culture divides instead of unites and that Christians who follow Jesus' example are uniquely qualified to fight for justice and the oppressed. David A.R. White and John Corbett co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes idea that it's important to stand up for what's right, what you believe in, even in the face of strong opposition. Fight hate with love, not with hate. Shows that Christians, like all humans, fail and stumble not only in their faith but in how they connect with non-believers. But also a strong emphasis on Christianity being the only true faith; positions the protest as accomplishing nothing but dividing communities.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pastor Dave tries to be a light in the darkness. He recognizes when he's wrong and asks for forgiveness, and he offers it to others, too. Keaton struggles with her faith and finds it after a lot of soul searching and prayer. Pearce exemplifies how churches and Christians can turn people off if and when they question or move away from their faith. Reverend Roland teaches Pastor Dave that persecution isn't new (he, for example, as a black preacher, has been persecuted most of his life).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Angry college student vandalizes, throws a brick at a church, leading to an accidental explosion that kills someone. Lead pastor tries to drag the victim to safety in a dramatic/potentially scary scene, but victim ends up dying despite efforts. Later, a brick is thrown into the college president's home, scaring his wife and children. College president punches the pastor for being the cause of death threats against his family; the pastor punches back.

Unsurprisingly, there's constant violence. Characters are shot and killed, often at close range in graphic scenes. Characters are strangled to death and die in car explosions. Domestic abuse is shown: A man beats his wife with a belt. In one of many iconic scenes, a movie executive wakes up covered in blood, with a decapitated horse's head in his bed. In the opening scene, a man asks Don Corleone for vengeance after two men raped and beat his daughter. Ethnic and racial slurs are heard, as well as some profanity, including the \"N\" word. The movie also depicts Italian American culture in a sympathetic but crude and stereotypical light. Characters smoke cigarettes and drink wine, and there's brief nudity (female breasts) and a scene of clothed but audible sex. References are made to the sexual behavior of Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale).\n|Positive Messages|: Movie explores double standards and hypocrisy of the Mafia characters, as they profess to be religious, and family- and friend-centered, but their actions ultimately come down to \"just business,\" no matter who gets hurt or killed. As in other Godfather movies, a theme is hypocrisy of American life: People successful and/or religious and family-oriented on one level are also cutthroat, willing to do whatever is necessary to provide for their families.\n|Positive Role Models|: Positive aspects of Italian American life and culture are overshadowed by Mafia killings and double-crossing.\n|Diverse Representations|: The Godfather relies on -- and firmly cemented in the public's mind -- the stereotype of Italian Americans as violent gangsters. Despite this, characters are shown with depth. Southern Italian and Sicilian culture, as it was brought over by immigrants from late 19th and early 20th century, is shown at length.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Constant mob movie violence.

In another scene, a sex worker is dead in a bed, handcuffed and covered in blood. Some profanity is heard, including \"f--king,\" as well as racial and ethnic slurs, plus sexual innuendo concerning male genitalia. There's wine and champagne drinking at a lavish First Communion party, including a character who is visibly drunk, as well as cocktail drinking in nightclubs and cigarette and cigar smoking. Overall, this movie and the first Godfather are defining classics of the Mafia genre, and their influence on later mob films and pop culture reverberates years after they were released.\n|Positive Messages|: While importance of family is a central theme, story is about a Mafia family, people who seem to be above the law and justice. The only justice in the film is mob justice, which means they lie, cheat, kill on their quest to amass fortunes and build empires.\n|Positive Role Models|: Vito, and, later, Michael, do what they need to do to provide for their families, in spite of double standards of being devout Catholics while also engaging in murder, extortion, etc. Movie shows struggles faced by Italians upon arriving in New York City, and, while centered on ugly actions of mafia, also provides glimpse into lives and culture of Italians as they began to assimilate into American life, in spite of prejudice and poverty.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent mob movie violence.

Although there isn't anything particularly gory, the smashing and crushing and pounding might be scary for younger kids, especially since some scenes feature children extremely frightened and afraid for their lives (a child also witnesses the destruction of his parents' workplace from afar). Early in the movie, a man watches his wife die as part of a terrible accident; her death impacts him significantly. Expect some mild swearing, a few kisses between a couple, and minor social drinking. Fans of the original film will be glad to know that the giant radioactive monster, when he does make an appearance, is still impressive after all these years (and better special effects).\n|Positive Messages|: Man shouldn't interfere with the course of nature. There should be respect between the planet and the people living in it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Family matters a lot in this movie. Joe Brody is a devoted husband who won't quit until he figures out the truth behind his wife's death.

There are also some gory moments when the titans tear monsters apart and kill humans, and high-tech guns are used.

Courage and empathy help the characters succeed. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, and Brian Tyree Henry star.\n|Positive Messages|: It takes courage to fight for peace between humans and monsters. Empathizing with King Kong and Godzilla helps the characters with their mission of saving the world.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main characters want to keep balance between monsters and humans. Madison Russell, in particular, goes to the limit to save Godzilla from being hurt. Jia speaks to King Kong to help him feel at ease and to find his home.

Expect destruction on a massive scale: Giant swathes of land and cities full of people are wiped out by monsters who stomp through civilization heedlessly. Scores of people are killed -- crushed, eaten, dropped from great heights, hurled against walls, imprisoned in giant webs, etc. -- but there's no blood or gore, and the deaths are usually pictured from a distance. That lessens the impact, but young/sensitive viewers might still be scared. A couple of deaths are scarier, including ones in which characters sacrifice their own lives to save others. Romance/sex is almost nonexistent, save for a few references to mating monsters, and there's no drinking (one character does have a beer on his desk and refers to inviting a monster over for a beer). Cursing is infrequent, but characters do say \"f--k,\" \"s--t, \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" and \"bitch,\" generally in reference to the monsters. The movie's central theme, in which humans wish to find ways to reverse the damage we've done to our planet, is a positive one, but the method one particular scientist is working toward will only succeed if huge numbers of people die. The supporting cast has extensive diversity, but the main characters are all white, and none of them are given particularly meaty arcs. Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, and Kyle Chandler co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Central theme -- that giant monsters may represent a way to halt humanity's destruction due to climate change -- is a powerful one, particularly when characters talk about ecological balance. But what movie doesn't say is that the balance would come about by wiping out a significant part of the world's population, which is hardly a positive message.\n|Positive Role Models|: Emma and Mark Russell are brilliant scientists hoping to prevent war and destruction, but they go about their aims in different ways. Emma is the most complicated character; she's willing to sacrifice many people for greater good of humankind, but wants to keep her own family members safe. Madison is an ethical young person who sees the flaws in her mom's logic (but doesn't have a better humanity-saving idea to offer). Extensive racial and ethnic diversity within supporting cast; main characters are all white.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extensive, near-constant violent scenes, generally involving giant monsters battling each other or humans running in terror (and often not making it). Giant monster battles are bloodless, even when one monster's head is lopped off. People are crushed, eaten, set on fire, hurled through the air, dropped into vast pits, etc., though often faceless, far away. Countless people are killed in giant accidents, but camera doesn't linger on dead bodies, and viewers don't see blood or gore.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mating is mentioned a couple of times in relation to the giant monsters -- e.g., one creature is said to be heading toward another for \"food, a fight, or something more intimate.\"\n|Language|: Cursing is infrequent but includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t, \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" and \"bitch,\" plus \"Jesus Christ\" as an exclamation.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One character sometimes has a beer on his desk and refers to drinking, but no one acts drunk, and no one actually drinks.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a3fad5437001f777107": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/gone-girl", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Gone Girl -- David Fincher's dark but engrossing psychological thriller based on Gillian Flynn's best-selling 2012 novel -- centers on flawed, disturbing characters (played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, among others).

(Spoiler alert!) Apatosaurus Arlo is separated from his family after a severe storm/flash flood claims his father's life (a series of events that could definitely upset kids); plus, carnivorous, sharp-toothed beasts attack Arlo and his human friend, Spot; more storms bring destruction and deadly threats; and the heroes barely survive a dangerous ride down a waterfall -- which is all the more intense because the film's settings look extremely real. Arlo's many fears and desperation to get home will certainly make some kids anxious; be ready to reassure them. There's also a scene in which Arlo and Spot scarf down fermented fruit, seem to get a little drunk (they hallucinate), and then wake up with headaches.

Kindness, loyalty, encouragement, and resourcefulness are all important. You can make your mark by doing something bigger than yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: Arlo must overcome his many fears in order to survive in foreign terrain against the threats and ravages of nature. His friend/pet human, Spot, shows Arlo kindness and loyalty and teaches him how to live off the land. Some strangers they meet are helpful and encouraging.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many scenes of peril/danger, as well as loss. (Spoiler alert!) Arlo's father dies in a flood, and, shortly after, the younger dinosaur is separated from the rest of his family and must fend for himself in the wilderness; later audiences learn that Spot lost his family, too. Carnivorous predatory birds and dinosaurs (many with big, sharp teeth) menace Arlo and Spot; they get caught in a stampede as well. Major forces of nature -- including storms, floods, and treacherous mountain passes (all of which look very real) -- repeatedly put Arlo and Spot at mortal risk. Some fighting/hunting; Spot is fierce and fearless, and at one point he rips the head off of a beetle he captures.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Dang,\" \"shoot,\" one \"bull\" that almost sounds like the start of a stronger word.\n|Products & Purchases|: No actual products within the film, but lots of off-line marketing/licensing tie-ins, from books and apps to a wide variety of toys, clothes, and much more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Famished Arlo and Spot eat some fermented fruit, get altered/drunk (they hallucinate), and wake up with hangovers.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776826880197001ec905d0": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/good-will-hunting", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that despite a constant onslaught of angry, sexual, and insulting language (\"f--k\" and its comrades \"s--t,\" \"retard,\" and \"a--hole\" are used incessantly, as are other salty words and terms) in Good Will Hunting, mature teens and adults will find this Oscar-winning drama about a self-destructive young man who's transformed by caring relationships to be an uplifting and inspiring story. One street brawl early in the film includes bloody fistfights, kicking, and pounding; sexuality includes some passionate kissing, post-sexual cuddling, and one session of inferred masturbation. The young people -- both college students and street kids -- drink beer and other alcohol throughout the movie.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie sends the message that finding your special gifts can rescue even the most seemingly powerless individuals from hard lives. It also says that love and commitment are incomparable sources of healing and change and that true friendship is selfless, not envious. Themes include compassion, empathy, communication and integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: The story follows an angry, bitter, self-destructive young man who's transformed by caring, unselfish relationships. Two college teachers are portrayed as having distinctly different motivations: One is dedicated to advancing science while the other hopes to enable his student to transcend an abusive childhood, realize his full potential, and find a balance in life.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One violent fist fight early in the film: Street toughs attack another group of young men in a no-holds-barred kicking and punching session.

Its mature themes -- including death and grief -- and scenes of gripping peril make it best for teens and adults. Younger kids may be frightened by some sequences, including one that's notably gory/gruesome. There's also some swearing (including both \"f--k\" and \"s--t\").\n|Positive Messages|: The power of hope is boundless; it can push through darkness and propel you to survive.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dr. Ryan Stone may seem broken, but her will to live is stronger than her darkest of days.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A debris shower in outer space, precipitated by the missile shooting of a satellite, wreaks havoc, slicing through space stations manned by humans.

There's not too much swearing (though some soundtrack song lyrics include infrequent use of \"s--t\" and \"f--k\"), but expect some violence (a man punches another, a car hits a woman head-on, and a character shoots another) and sexuality. Couples -- including people married to others  -- are shown kissing and in bed (bare shoulders). Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Carey Mulligan star; that, plus the movie's hip soundtrack and lush style, are likely to make it very appealing to teens.\n|Positive Messages|: The film's underlying message is pretty bleak: People, especially privileged people with no perspective, can be rotten. But, in a way, it also celebrates those who continue to hold hope, even in the face of cynicism. There's a conspicuous flaunting of wealth and some discussion about \"old\" and \"new\" money.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most everyone behaves in questionable ways in the movie (and the book), but narrator Nick Carraway manages to become the moral center. In the end, he's the one who identifies the callousness that pervades the likes of Tom, Daisy, and their friends.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man is held by two others while someone else hits him, in a very brief scene. Another character runs over a woman with a car; her body is shown many times hitting the windshield and thudding to the ground. A man is also shown shooting someone from a distance and then putting the same gun in his mouth. A man strikes a woman hard.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple is heard moaning from behind closed doors. Married men grope at women who aren't their wives, and infidelity is a big part of the overall plot. Some innuendo. A couple exchanges some passionate kisses and is later shown partially nude (no sensitive body parts shown) in bed, under the covers.\n|Language|: Language includes relatively infrequent use of \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"son of a bitch,\" and some derogatory/racist terms and comments.

Barnum, who starts out as a penniless orphan but becomes the world-renowned creator of the circus. There's a bit of language (\"damn,\" the racial slur \"spooks,\" \"oh God!,\" etc.) and violence (protesters burn down the circus, a man slaps a young boy), as well as some drama surrounding the movie's interracial romance, which was taboo at the time. But overall the plot and songs are easy enough for tweens to follow -- and with Zendaya and Zac Efron co-starring, the movie is likely to appeal to them. Although it's based on factual events, the movie only covers a short period in Barnum's life and glosses over certain aspects of his career. It's not garnering the same kind of acclaim as La La Land, but The Greatest Showman's charming leads and circus scenes should make it a fun pick for families who enjoy history, musical theater, and, of course, the circus.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages tolerance and acceptance of race, class, physical disabilities, and differences. Diversity and uniqueness are championed within the world of the circus, even as others consider it a \"freak\" show. Barnum is a purveyor and defender of mass/broad entertainment, which he believes has value, even though cultural critics prefer highbrow/fine arts.\n|Positive Role Models|: The circus performers bond together and help one another feel accepted and at home in their community. Barnum is a showman who needs more and more fans, particularly rich ones, to feel validated, despite having an adoring and loyal wife, children, and close friends. Barnum's wife, Charity, is steadfast, loyal, and kind. Phillip and Anne fall in love across the racial divide of the era.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A rich man slaps a tradesman's son for making his daughter laugh. A young man steals bread and is later smacked for doing so. Angry protesters threaten the circus performers and later set the circus on fire. The fire leads to a supporting character being severely injured, but he survives.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Longing looks and a few passionate kisses between a married couple and another couple in love. A married man spends a lot of time with an unmarried woman; she kisses him in public, even though he doesn't reciprocate. A couple holds hands and eventually kisses and declares their love, even though they know their interracial relationship is considered taboo by others.\n|Language|: Insults/threatening language: \"freaks,\" \"abominations,\" \"stay away from my daughter,\" etc. A white couple tells their son not to go around \"with the help\" when they see he's taken a black woman on a date.

It tells the story of a days-long battle between Nazi submarines and a convoy of Allied ships carrying essential arms and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to England. The action is fierce and frequent, and suspense is high. Torpedoes, machine gun fire, and artillery hit their marks. Ships and U-boats catch fire and explode. The filmmakers have opted to register the loss of life on the faces of the mostly very young men who watch in fear and horror from a distance, rather than via those being injured and killed. One wounded sailor is shown, and three flag-draped bodies are buried at sea. Language includes one use each of \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"f--k\" (after which the speaker immediately apologizes). The film makes a strong statement about the tragedy of war, as well as about integrity, teamwork, compassion, and grace under fire.\n|Positive Messages|: Subtle messages about devastation caused by war.

Expect lots of falls from heights, catapulting through the air, speeding on sleds, etc. The Grinch ends up in his underwear in a brief scene, and a naked Who is seen behind a cookie that's strategically placed to obscure anything inappropriate. Like Seuss' original, this is a story about kindness, compassion, love, and generosity being the true meaning of Christmas.\n|Educational Value|: Encourages kids to delve into Dr. Seuss' story, look past the commercialization of holidays, value friendship and community.\n|Positive Messages|: Kindness, compassion, love are true spirit of Christmas.

One character is depicted as a booze-loving lush, and though the main characters are ostensibly good friends, they're not particularly kind to one another (their kids also behave rudely, expecting to be waited on hand and foot and maligning anything that's not fancy or technologically advanced). Language includes \"s--t\" and \"ass.\"\n|Positive Messages|: The movie explores the impact of middle age, depicting it as a time when people start coming to terms with who they are instead of who they thought they would be. Part of that realization process is that people still have time to change if they want to -- though some of the people who try get discouraged because it can be tough. The movie presents childhood as a time for imaginative play and adventure seeking, rather than texting or playing video games. Amid the broader messages are a fair number of potty-humor gags (peeing in the pool) and jokes based on issues like weight.\n|Positive Role Models|: The five main characters are extreme archetypes of middle-aged men. None of them has their act completely together, but some are worse off than others, and while some grow during the course of the film, others don't. (That said, all are trying to do right by their families.) Their kids are shown acting up; in one family, they boss their nanny around via text message, expecting to be waited on.

Female characters are thinly drawn and often the butt of jokes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of slapstick humor, but no real violence. Friends play a game in which they shoot an arrow into the air and then run away, hoping to avoid it as it crashes down. Kids are shown playing a video game in which they shoot and kill other characters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One male character is seen from behind, naked from the waist down.

You can also expect a fair bit of drinking/drunkenness during raucous parties. The foursome have a strong friendship, but the movie's attempts at positive messages are mostly lost beneath the crude comedy.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's underlying message is that friendship runs thicker than water -- and that having a supportive spouse at your side is a big help, too -- but there's plenty of crude comedy layered over those take-aways.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lifelong friends Lenny, Eric, Marcus, and Kurt are there for each other, whatever life tosses their way. So are their spouses (or significant others) and children. But they're sometimes sexist, quick to objectify women, and prone to fits of macho-ness that can border on bullying.

It's essentially about a cursed house that haunts anyone who dares to enter. Expect lots of blood and gore, rotted corpses, severed fingers, a body falling and smashing to the ground, a gun being drawn and fired (a bloody, failed suicide attempt), a car crash, and a fire, plus plenty of jump scares and frightening sounds. Language includes two uses of \"f--k,\" several uses of \"s--t,\" and \"oh God\" and \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation).

The characters who are cursed have done nothing wrong other than walking into a house.\n|Positive Role Models|: Detective Muldoon is a struggling, working single mom who seems to be holding things together. She has authority and street smarts and is almost admirable, but there are also long, unexplained times in which her son seems to be home alone (although a \"sitter\" is mentioned in one scene).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Blood spatters, gore, gurgling blood.

While this teen-targeted horror sequel features relatively little actual gore, the scary scenes are tense and aggressive, with loud soundtrack effects, jarring editing, and insinuated violence. There's some brief nudity (male and female characters appear in showers and bathtubs) and a scene that sets up sex in a hotel room between two teens, but doesn't deliver because the ghost strikes. Ghost attacks throughout the movie are discordant and sometimes alarming. The ghosts are very creepy-looking, shadows and noises establish scary spaces, and characters scream and show fear and pain repeatedly. There's some actual violence (someone is slammed with a frying pan in the first scene, and murders are referred to repeatedly), as well as lots of abstract and menacing visual references to violence: blood on the walls and on a couple of faces, a broken neck in a contorted ghost figure, and drowned bodies. Cigarette smoking. \"Mean girl\" teens verbally bully and peer pressure another teen girl.\n|Positive Messages|: Standard horror movie sequel.\n|Positive Role Models|: One of the lead female characters learns to stand up for herself. Otherwise, \"mean girl\" teens peer pressure another girl into going into the haunted house, and the other characters are basically stock horror characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Murders and disturbing disappearances. Frequent jump-scares. Scene shows woman pouring hot bacon grease on her husband's head, then smashing his head with the frying pan (bloody dead face visible in subsequent/repeat scene). Repeated scary images of ghost faces and sounds of ghost's screams. A young boy is terrorized by ghosts and the sight of his father's corpse in the kitchen. Ghost hands repeatedly take hold of victims' faces and pull them away to offscreen horror. A body falls off a roof, landing with thud in front of a horrified character. A man holds keys so tightly that his hand is bloody. A father breaks his wife's neck and drowns his young son, in flashback scenes/rehashing of what happened in the first movie. Very brief look at the \"stair ghost,\" with jerky movements and contortions. \"Mean girl\" teens verbally bully and peer pressure another teen girl.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Girls roll up school-uniform skirts to \"show off legs.\" Glimpses of nudity in tub/shower (long shot of boy from side and back; close ups of girl's face in shower as she's frightened); a high school girl and her boyfriend rent a hotel room for sex, but she disappears before they can do it (she mistakes ghost under the covers with her for boyfriend -- creepy suggestion that the ghost is tickling/touching her below her waist).\n|Language|: Infrequent mild profanity: \"damn,\" \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Panda Express bag in one scene.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Cigarette smoking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a8718ba001e312584": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-grudge-3", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Grudge 3 is a supernatural horror movie in which two vengeful spirits continue to wreak havoc in an apartment building.

There's violence, but it's mostly hand-to-hand combat and a few deaths (or near deaths) that are heartbreaking for other characters and viewers alike (one involves a child's loss of a parent), in addition to grand-scale action violence with explosions and weapons. There are references to Peter's reputation as a ladies' man and jokes about his past conquests; Peter and Gamora also have a lot of chemistry and almost kiss a couple of times. Language isn't frequent but includes \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"bastard,\" and \"d--k\"; at one point, the Guardians also drink an unidentified liquid that makes them drunk. With a little less edge than Iron Man or The Avengers, this adventure is a good fit for a slightly younger crowd than some other superhero movies, especially since it encourages teamwork and friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: As in most superhero movies, there's a positive underlying message about teamwork, friendship, and helping others -- even if the characters' motivations and actions aren't always 100 percent pure.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Guardians are all flawed (they're outlaws for a reason), but they ultimately make selfless decisions to protect one another and defend the universe.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of hand-to-hand combat, fist fights, explosions, and shoot outs with what look like stun guns that incapacitate but don't kill. But characters do die, and in a couple of cases, the deaths are heartbreaking (spoiler alert: one starts off the movie and involves the sad loss of a parent, and the other is only temporary). In a couple of other scenes, it looks like characters have been killed, but they end up OK. There's not much gore and blood, but an entire fleet of fighter pilots dies in an explosion, and there's collateral damage as the villain tries to destroy a planet.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Cues and comments that Peter has been with lots of women across the galaxy, as well as references to his past exploits, like a joke about \"black light\" picking up how filthy his ship is or another about him referred to as \"one who lain with [alien creature].\" Continued sexual tension between Peter and Gamora, who almost kiss more than once.

Expect lots of interest from kids of all ages, but it's most appropriate for tweens and up. There's frequent fighting with weapons (swords, guns, and more), space chases/battles, executions that involve people being \"spaced\" (forced out of airlocks to die in the freezing cold of deep space), and more. Spoiler alert: A popular character dies. Language, while not frequent, can also be strong, with everything from \"douche\" and \"d--k\" to \"s--t,\" \"a--hole.\" There's a bit of drinking, characters have romantic tension, and a couple of scenes show scantily clad females; there are also references to explaining conception. But all in all, it's still a bit less edgy than many other superhero movies. Plus, unlike the Avengers, the Guardians always fight together and exemplify the spirit of teamwork, friendship, and unconditional chosen-family bonds.\n|Positive Messages|: The Guardians are all about teamwork and redemption, the power of second chances, and the idea that family isn't limited to blood but can extend to the bonds and promises you make to people you care about and respect. Also a great lesson that although family/tribe/squad members might fight and disagree, they always have one another's backs. That said, the characters' motivations and actions aren't always 100 percent pure.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Guardians continue to be a group of flawed, roguish former outlaws. They're misfits with checkered pasts, but they ultimately make selfless decisions to protect one another and defend the universe. They're courageous and won't give up until they've vanquished threats to not just themselves but to the greater good. Gamora and Nebula aren't typical female superhero characters or sisters. Gamora finally apologizes for their upbringing and how she treated Nebula. Yondu is able to redeem himself for his mistakes and betrayals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: At one point it seems like the heroes will die, and (spoiler alert!) a popular character does die, so kids should be prepared for that. Hand-to-hand combat using guns, swords, and taser-like weapons. Lots of explosions, crashes, and tense, war-like space chases/battles in which a fleet of remotely controlled ships aims to shoot down the Guardians' ship. Frequent peril and danger; fights against huge, scary enemies. Many executions in which people are \"spaced\" (i.e. forced out of airlocks to die in the freezing cold of deep space). High body counts in a couple of sequences, particularly the scene with the executions and one with a special arrow that zips around, bloodily shooting through victims. Collateral damage as something begins to take over planets, destroying everything in its wake.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Peter's parents are shown kissing. The Ravagers are shown with scantily clad females (robots with human-like faces) who could be construed as prostitutes; some dance, while others sit on/with the pub/lounge's patrons. Continued romantic tension between Peter and Gamora, which leads to longing looks, a couple of almost kisses, and one moment in which an empath reveals that Peter has strong feelings for Gamora. Peter flirts with a high priestess by offering to show her how natural conception works. Drax wants to know about Ego and Meredith Quill's conception of Peter and recalls that his own father would annually tell the tale of Drax's conception. Drax and Mantis seem to share a connection that could lead to romance in future installments.\n|Language|: Strong language isn't constant but includes \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"damn,\" several uses of \"d--k\" and \"douchebag,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"idiot,\" \"bastard,\" \"crap,\" \"prick,\" \"jackass,\" \"doofus,\" etc. More frequently, the words are said euphemistically, like \"turd,\" \"freakin'\" or \"a-holes.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands seen in the movie include Sony, Zune, Dairy Queen, and Ford. Lots of off-screen Guardians and Marvel merchandise available: apparel, figurines, video games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Ravagers and others drink at a pub (and on their ship) -- some to the obvious point of drunkenness.

While there are themes of teamwork, courage, and compassion, the movie also uses murder and violence in a detached way to create an \"exciting\" atmosphere, which may disturb some viewers (or glamorize the mayhem). Expect many extended scenes of exaggerated, brutal violence, including gun use, decapitation, stabbings, grenade/car explosions, serious injuries/wounds, and hand-to-hand combat. Swearing is also an issue; language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid all of the action is the message that having compassion can prevent you from hurting others and lead you toward a more courageous path. Also, it takes courage to protect others, even if it means putting yourself at risk. And protecting what's important can take teamwork with like-minded people.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sam has done lots of killing as an assassin for The Firm, but she turns a new leaf when she protects a girl who's in danger from other lethal forces. Sam puts her life at risk and brings her family of assassin aunts back together. Their teamwork helps them battle opposing killers. Female focus is notable, with older women (including older women of color) prominently represented in a genre they're often sidelined in.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of killing, including via exaggerated gun violence, decapitation, stabbings, grenade/car explosions, and hand-to-hand combat. Violence also includes breaking bones and dislocated body parts, a person being tased, gunshots, and a knife cut to the cheek.

Director Mel Gibson doesn't shy away from showing extremely graphic war violence. Bullets pierce flesh in slow motion, explosions toss men in the air, bleeding leg and arm stumps are shown, throats are slashed, soldiers bayonet each other to death, and men are graphically gutted, disembodied, and beheaded, with entrails and ligaments left hanging. Doss is also beaten by his fellow soldiers during basic training due to his refusal to carry a weapon. And his superior officers jail and put him on trial. Doss kisses and marries a nurse; they're seen (him shirtless, her clothed) on their wedding night. Doss' father is an abusive alcoholic. Adults smoke cigarettes and use language including: \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"t--ties,\" \"bitch,\" and the racist terms \"Japs\" and \"Nips.\" Ultimately, though the movie's message is one of courage, integrity, and sticking to your convictions.\n|Positive Messages|: Have integrity, and stick to your convictions. Sometimes playing by the rules isn't the best way to do good. If you believe in yourself, it's OK if others don't understand you or even hate you. Courage is a clear theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Raised in a religious but violent home, young Doss nearly kills his brother with a brick. Later he renounces violence and refuses to even touch a weapon. He feels it's his duty to serve his country in battle as a medic, saving people. He valiantly sticks to his principles when the army tries to court martial him. Fellow soldiers who taunt and beat him later apologize after Doss puts himself in harm's way to save wounded soldiers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely graphic war violence. Men are killed and maimed, all realistically shown. Soldiers are hacked into pieces by explosions. Warring soldiers hold a live grenade between them and grab onto each other until the grenade explodes, killing them both. Bullets hit soldiers in the head, legs, torsos, and more; lots of blood. Soldiers bayonet each other, and men on both sides are lit on fire (while alive) by flame-throwing weapons. Some slit enemies' throats. Piles of human entrails are seen on the battlefield. A man's foot is impaled with a knife. Rats gnaw at dead bodies. About to be defeated, a Japanese commander eviscerates himself with a knife, after which his head is cut off. Two young brothers fight, punching each other; one hits the other in the head with a large brick. An alcoholic father beats his children and wife and threatens the latter with a gun. Their grown son intervenes and points the gun at his father. A woman slaps a man after he kisses her, demanding he ask her first. A needle is inserted into the arm of a man giving blood. Doss' hands are rubbed raw and bloody from lowering wounded soldiers down the ridge by pulley. During the second battle, Doss kicks a live grenade back at the Japanese.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing, sometimes passionately. Doss and Dorothy prepare to go to bed on their wedding night; she's clothed, he shirtless. Soldiers are advised to \"wear a hat\" (a condom) if they plan to have sex. Non-sexual nudity includes a soldier doing pull-ups while naked and being forced to run an obstacle course naked by his sergeant (no graphic nudity).\n|Language|: \"S--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"numb nuts,\" \"t-tty,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" as an exclamation.

Kids younger than 11 will miss much of the meaning while still being entertained by the characters and the production. Some of the song lyrics are a tad sexually suggestive: \"I won't go all the way/but I'll go pretty far\" and \"The darker the berry/the sweeter the juice\" are just two examples. Since it's set in the early '60s, African Americans are called \"Negroes\" (and, in one case, \"lawn jockeys\"). There are a lot of weight-based insults and one case of parental abuse: Mrs. Pingleton literally ties Penny to her bed and calls her a \"devil child.\" In one scene, three \"bad girls\" are shown smoking in the school bathroom, while adults sit in a smoke-filled teachers' lounge.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's major theme is seeing beyond people's looks or skin color.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tracy marches in favor of integration.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Baltimore police push and shove African-American demonstrators marching for integration.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote and stars as Alexander Hamilton in the hip-hop-inspired musical. Both young fans of the show and new audiences are likely to be interested in the Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play: It's a true cultural phenomenon, with easily recognizable songs and references. The story does have mature themes, including adultery (there's a steamy number between Hamilton and a mistress) and dangerous rivalry throughout. Language includes a use of \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" damn,\" \"God,\" \"bastard,\" \"whore,\" hell,\" \"ass,\" \"pr--k,\" and \"Jesus Christ.\" Darker scenes deal with war and deadly pistol duels. A suicide by hanging is alluded to, and the realities of slavery and the fact that many of these historical figures owned enslaved people are minimized. But there are plenty of inspiring and empowering messages here, as well as a strong theme of perseverance. And casting these White historical figures with a diverse group of actors offers new role models for young people thinking about what it means to be American.\n|Positive Messages|: This take on origin story of the USA, including intricacies of early political in-fighting, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers, holds plenty of inspiration, relevant lessons for viewers today. Also has messages of empowerment for people of color, women, immigrants. On the downside, the realities of slavery and the fact that many of these historical figures owned enslaved people are minimized.\n|Positive Role Models|: Casting these all-White historical figures with diverse group of actors offers reimagined role models for young people thinking about what it means to be American. Characters are largely depicted as intelligent, persevering, brave, faithful, and/or funny, but they're also flawed and reveal jealousy, fierce ambition, disloyalty, and a willingness to die or kill in name of honor or principle. Plus, many owned enslaved people, a fact that's largely minimized/glossed over, and the voices of those people aren't heard in the musical. Angelica does speak up in favor of including \"women in the sequel,\" drawing attention to fact that United States' founders focused almost exclusively on rights of White men.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hamilton and his son are both killed (shot) in duels. Men call each other to revolution and war. Soldiers dance with weapons while gun and cannon blasts sound in the background. A suicide by hanging is alluded to. Hamilton says he should have shot someone \"in the mouth.\" Arguments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Hamilton and Eliza share a kiss on their wedding day. Even after he's married, Hamilton flirts with his sister-in-law and has an affair with another woman, highlighted in a somewhat steamy dance number. Song lyrics include reference to intercourse, \"deflowering\" women, stripping \"down to our socks,\" and keeping a woman's \"bed warm\" while her husband is away. Aaron Burr has a long-running affair with another man's wife.\n|Language|: Two uses of \"f--k\" have been cut from the original version, but plenty of strong language remains, including one \"f--k,\" various forms of \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"bastard,\" \"whore,\" hell,\" \"ass,\" and \"pr--k,\" and \"God\" and \"Jesus Christ\" used as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink socially at various events (\"pour me another brew, son\").\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776832e6d55c002040c83c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hancock", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although kids will definitely be interested in seeing this Will Smith superhero movie (thanks to both his presence and a massive marketing campaign), a definite tragic streak runs through it. That, along with the movie's other themes -- mortality, the meaning of love -- may prove too mature for young kids and tweens. There's also plenty of swearing (including an \"F\" word) and a fair amount of action/fantasy violence, including gunfire, cut-off hands, and Hancock himself yelling at kids and destroying buildings. That said, the movie also has a lot of heart (plus some good Will Smith comic moments) and isn't just your average popcorn flick. An unrated version of this DVD is available and contains a sex scene and some other material that do not appear in the original.\n|Positive Messages|: Some mixed messages. There are many depictions of criminal behavior, but they're almost always foiled by Hancock and others, so it shows that ultimately crime does not pay.\n|Positive Role Models|: There are both positive and negative role models here. Hancock isn't an entirely sympathetic hero. In fact, he's pretty tragic and troubled, and his presence troubles others. He's sometimes disrespectful of women, he scares children, and he shows little concern to everybody else. But he eventually comes around and is softened considerably by meeting a good guy who's so good that he's almost saintly.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of fantasy/superhero action. Hancock is a pretty violent superhero. He yells at kids, destroys buildings and other things while he's performing good deeds, and manhandles criminals (one scene has him shoving a man's head into an unusual spot). He even takes on a young bully. Meanwhile, the official bad guys wield guns (shooting them frequently) and terrorize the citizens of Los Angeles on the freeway, during a bank holdup, in a liquor store robbery, etc. One criminal gets both of his hands cut off at different times; one scene shows it happening, quickly. He and his goons attack the main character.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man kisses a woman who's married to someone else; lots of sexual tension between them, but no nudity/action.\n|Language|: Salty language runs the gamut, from \"hell\" and \"bitch\" to \"s--t\" and \"asshole\" -- and finally \"f--k\" (but since it's PG-13, use is limited).\n|Products & Purchases|: Some labels/brands, including Ray-Bans, Dewars, Dodge, and Dunkin Donuts.

Parents also need to know that this review is for the rated version of this film.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's message is, at best, a little muddled; while the three main characters pay a price for their misadventures -- beatings, dehydration, sunburn, and more -- everything works out well in the end.\n|Positive Role Models|: Friends act despicably, but pay the price. And in the end, they're loyal and kind to one another. While some female characters are depicted as life partners and positive influences, some are depicted as nagging harridans or simple sex objects.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Beatings, vehicular mayhem, the use of stun guns on \"volunteers\" in front of children (with children, in two cases, operating the stun guns/tazers), beatings with crowbars, and a gunshot wound to an innocent bystander. One character spends much of the film lamenting an excised tooth -- a bleeding, gaping wreck of a lost incisor. Some gunplay. A baby is hit in the head with a car door and is present during a few scenes of peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Extensive male and female nudity, including nude buttocks and breasts. Discussion of sexual acts, techniques, and one character's work as an \"escort.\" Photos of nudity and explicit sexual acts (including glimpsed male genitalia) in the closing-credits montage. Explicit discussions of infidelity, one-night stands, and other acts. Mimed mock bestiality for comedic effects. A character notes that he cannot be within 200 yards of\u00c2  \"A school ... or a Chuck E. Cheese,\" implying that he's on some kind of serial offender watchlist.\n|Language|: Extensive, inventive, and constant vulgarity, including \"f--k\" and its derivations, \"ass,\" \"f--got,\" \"douchebag,\" \"whore,\" \"gay,\" \"hell,\" \"shaft,\" \"s--t,\" \"Jesus,\" \"semen,\" \"retard,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"butt,\" \"weenus,\" \"bastard,\" \"balls,\" \"assholes,\" \"nuts,\"\u00c2  and much, much more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Mentions and on-screen display of brands includes many mentioned as plot points, including Caesar's Palace, Mercedes-Benz, Chuck E. Cheese, Rogaine, Monster Energy Drink, Gremlins, Indiana Jones, Rain Man, Jagermeister, Carnival Cruises, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The entire film revolves around excessive drinking and drug abuse. Characters drink beer, wine, and hard liquor to excess. A character thinks he's giving his friends Ecstasy without their consent but is, in fact, giving them \"Roofies,\" the \"date rape drug.\" Mentions of cocaine, crystal meth, and crank abuse. Drunk driving is implied. Photos in the closing-credits montage depict cocaine use. Reference to marijuana. It's worth noting that the brutal consequences of drug and alcohol abuse -- aches, memory loss, vomiting, humiliation, and despair -- are depicted unflinchingly.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776880ebdf2200209c0a56": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hangover-part-ii", "cs_age": 18, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 18+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that, in attempting to surpass the original film, this R-rated comedy sequel is even cruder and more explicit than the first installment (i.e. full-frontal shots of pre-operative transgender characters). This time around, the three main characters wake up in Bangkok with no memory of what transpired the previous night, only to learn that their evening included drug deals, a severed finger, plenty of drugs and drinking, and a surprising encounter with strippers. All of this is punctuated with non-stop swearing, including tons of F-bombs.\n|Positive Messages|: There are some mixed messages here. Although the take-away is to stick by your friends, the film also says that those same friends can get you into a lot of tight spots. And other so-called friends might even try to drug you...\n|Positive Role Models|: While some of the characters spend much of the movie lying -- and their behavior is certainly far from exemplary -- Stu ultimately decides to be completely honest about (almost) all of the group\u2019s misadventures and stands up to his contemptuous father-in-law.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few scenes include fistfights, brawling, and gunshots, as well as one car chase and a high-speed speedboat accident. One character loses a finger in a mysterious incident.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Explicit discussions about sexual encounters with prostitutes. Several full-frontal shots featuring pre-operative transgender characters, who have breasts and penises (all are visible). Other scenes with topless women. Spoiler alert: The ending features a montage of photos from the lost night that includes a variety of sexually explicit images that border on pornography.\n|Language|: Near non-stop swearing, including \"s--t,\" \"c--k,\" and liberal use of \"f--k\" (and variations thereof). Also \"d--k,\" \"c--t,\" \"oh my God,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" and \"damn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A few scenes feature Singha beer, a well-known Thai brand.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some drinking on screen, and many references to a night of debauchery that clearly involved lots of liquor. Some of the lowlights from the night are seen in a flashback scene in which the main characters are all portrayed as pre-teen boys who are drinking heavily and engaging in all manner of drunken misbehavior. One character snorts cocaine, and a drug deal is an important plot point. The film also features a monkey that smokes cigarettes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f352ad5fd3f001ee15db5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hannah-montana-the-movie", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Miley Cyrus' legions of tween fans will be dying to see this big-screen comedy based on Disney's hit TV show. Like the small-screen version, the movie is upbeat and perfectly G rated ... if yet another marketing tool in Hannah's merchandise-rich world. The sexuality is completely innocent -- flirting, slow dancing, conversations about relationships, and three really short kisses -- and there's no language, drinking, or smoking. Expect frequent physical comedy (pratfalls, getting hit with a ball, bitten by an animal, etc.) and one scene in which Hannah and Tyra Banks fight over a pair of shoes.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Kids will take away positive messages about being sincere and not taking yourself too seriously, as Miley learns that it doesn't matter whether she's a star or not -- she's not allowed to forget her roots and act like a diva.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters have strong family relationships and friendships. Miley does disappoint those closest to her as she struggles to balance her double life, but it all works out in the end.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hannah and Tyra Banks get into a cat fight (lots of jumping, pushing, and grabbing) over a pair of designer shoes. Other physical comedy includes several pratfalls, Miley getting hit in the face by a ball, a pesky ferret crawling all over a couple of characters, and a bit with a biting alligator and snappy ostrich.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild flirting as two sets of couples get to know each other. Other than three very quick kisses and some slow dancing, there's just a short glimpse of Miley's love interest with his shirt off after a swim.\n|Language|: A couple of \"oh my God\"s; one adult uses an insult to another (he calls a woman a \"succubus\"), but it will go over kids' head.\n|Products & Purchases|: The entire film is a Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana vehicle that will help promote the TV show, the movie soundtrack, and the piles of Hannah merchandise out there.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f34f368e4c8001fb5d8f0": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/happily-never-after", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although kids may want to see this animated fairy tale \"reimagining,\" it's not really worth their time. The movie revises the Cinderella story in order to let the \"bad guys\" win ... for a minute. This results in some minor violence, much dastardly laughter, and temporary changes to familiar fairy tale plots (Rumplestiltskin steals the baby, Sleeping Beauty doesn't wake up, etc.). Many genre clich\u00e9s are played out here: The wicked stepmother is mean, her daughters are obnoxious, the prince is dimwitted, and wolves, trolls, and the giant are ugly and lumbering. There's a little bit of potty humor, and a couple of none-too-menacing scenes in the dark woods. The cartoony violence primarily consists of falls and inconsequential explosions (no one dies).\n|Positive Messages|: Villains (especially the wicked stepmother) are predictably unpleasant (smelly, cackly, selfish), but in the end, they're defeated. Other cliched fairy tale behavior (obnoxious stepsisters, etc.) is also evident.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoony hijinks include explosions with no consequences, various falls and grumblings, and a \"battle scene\" in which the seven dwarves haul out a windmill-cum-catapult and shoot precious jewels at dive-bombing witches on brooms (it's a decidedly un-fun bit of business).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sexy-bodied bad stepmother: Her ballgown shows mighty cleavage and a slit up the side to reveal leg/high heels; plot focused on marriage (all the girls in the kingdom apparently want it, and the prince thinks he wants it); chaste kissing by primary couple.\n|Language|: Namecalling (\"dragon lady,\" \"salmonella,\" \"loser\") and other mild obnoxiousness (\"royal pain the butt,\" \"a butt the size of a shopping mall\").\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: During the villains' takeover of the palace, they're served food and unidentified drinks on trays.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776caf594b2b001e6fa934": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/happy-death-day", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Happy Death Day is a slasher movie with fantasy and comedy overtones. The main character (Jessica Rothe) is stuck in a time loop, \u00e0 la Groundhog Day, suffering a violent death over and over again until she figures out how to break the cycle. Considering the movie's premise and genre, the violence is actually on the milder side. Stabbings happen offscreen, but blood is shown on knife blades, and there's a brief spatter when a character falls from a high window. Characters are also hit with blunt objects and run over by a car. There's also some racy content. Sex among college students is spoken of, though not shown. But a male college student is shown preparing to masturbate to porn (there's a computer image of two men kissing), and a young woman walks naked through the quad (nothing graphic shown). Characters also kiss, and the main character has a short-lived affair with a teacher. Language includes a use of \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"a--hole,\" and more. Teens talk about drinking and being drunk, but no one is shown drinking. The movie is gleefully aware of its silliness and could be a strong draw for teens; luckily, there's an underlying message about thinking about others instead of just yourself.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes the idea of not thinking entirely of yourself, instead spending time thinking about others' feelings. Also advocates avoiding self-centered friends in favor of those who are kind and helpful.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tree is an unexpectedly decent role model; she starts out as a rather horrible, selfish person, but because of her plight, she does learn to take responsibility for herself and for others, although she resorts to violence to achieve this goal. One nasty character mimics a developmentally disabled person in one scene.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Revolves around the idea of repeated violent death, but the slasher violence is tamer than in many other horror movies. Still, there's stabbing with knives/broken bottles, mostly offscreen, but some blood seen. Punching, hitting with blunt objects. Character falls from a height, with brief blood spatter. Main character has a dead mother. Car plows over character, with dead body briefly shown. Fighting. Some characters assume that a young man sexually assaulted a drunk young woman, but he didn't.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A college student is said to be having an affair with a married teacher (she calls it off). Kissing. Sex between teen college students is discussed/implied, but nothing is shown. A character prepares to masturbate to porn (two men shown kissing passionately on computer screen). Main character walks naked through quad, but no sensitive body parts shown. Innuendo.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--k,\" plus one use of \"p---y\" and uses of \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"vagina,\" \"d--khead,\" \"whore,\" \"douche bag,\" \"tool,\" \"hell,\" \"balls.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mention of Tylenol; Apple iPhone shown.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many spoken references to underage drinking (\"you were so wasted last night\"), but nothing shown.

Slasher movie-style violence includes killings, stabbing, shooting, and some blood (dribbles and spurts). The main character dies via suicide several times with no consequences, as she's always resurrected. Characters are chased and stalked, and there's screaming and struggling. Women wear cleavage-revealing outfits and skimpy underwear, and college students kiss passionately. A naked man wearing a towel is caught in a woman's dorm room (he has a line about a three-way). Language includes a couple uses of \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" and more. There's a reference to a college girl being \"wasted\" and hung over, but nothing is shown. The storytelling is rather scattered, but it's still emotionally centered and quite entertaining for teens and up.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes value of learning kindness and selflessness, of doing the right thing over being selfish.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tree is still a troubled character who's quite fallible in many ways, but she eventually learns lessons about kindness, selflessness and tries to set things right/do the right thing (though at very end, she attempts something wicked once again).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Serial killer-related violence, with stabbings, shootings, blood (minor dribbling, spraying, etc.). Character repeatedly dies via suicide (though nothing is at stake, since she's always resurrected): She crashes a car into a power plant, jumps out of a plane, drops a hair dryer into a bathtub, falls from a building, dives into a wood-chipper, etc. Chasing, stalking, screaming.

There's sexy talk and suggestive behavior throughout, which the movie justifies through the plotline of penguins seeking mates. Much of this will likely go over most kids' heads, but it could lead to some uncomfortable moments. The movie also  deals with environmental themes related to humans intruding on natural habitats but avoids the heavy-duty questions of how to solve the problem. Some of the chase sequences and elephant seal scenes might be scary for younger kids. Also, stereotyping comes into play: Latin-coded penguins are caricatured as party-loving animals, and a penguin coded as Black comes across as an oversexed, fundamentalist preacher. Still, the movie's messages of integrity, social acceptance, and embracing your own uniqueness shine through.\n|Educational Value|: Kids are likely to pick up some talking points about conservation and environmentalism \u200b\u200band may be inspired to learn more about penguins communicating through vocalization. They'll also learn the importance of being true to yourself.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes the importance of friendships and family and the value of supporting and accepting one another despite differences. The plotline of penguins finding a mate feels overly sexual at times, but the overall story is well-meaning and positive. Ultimately the message of embracing your own uniqueness shines through. The movie also has strong environmental messages and themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mumble is an excellent role model showing integrity, bravery, and determination. He's also compassionate, open-hearted, optimistic, and largely unselfconscious. He embraces being different and finds something he's good at in order to stand out from the colony. Gloria is happy, caring, and confident. Mom and Dad are loving and supportive, largely proud of their son despite his differences. The Adelie penguins are supportive and encouraging, accepting Mumble without prejudice.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Even in a story about penguins, diversity is lacking -- the vast majority of main characters are male, while the two significant female characters are lusted after and somewhat objectified. The female penguins' shape suggests they have breasts and cleavage. Stereotypes include Latin-coded penguins caricatured as party-loving and sexually energetic. A penguin coded as Black comes across as an oversexed, fundamentalist preacher. Two of these characters are voiced by Robin Williams putting on exaggerated accents, reflecting a lack of diversity among the cast. Disability is touched upon but never explicitly clarified -- Mumble is simply referred to as \"different.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: The penguins are attacked by scary elephant seals. They must face cold and blizzards. \u200b\u200bSeabirds threaten to eat baby Mumble, pinning him down, then leaving him shivering in an ice hole. A large Emperor penguin slaps a smaller Adelie penguin. Peril when killer whales try to catch the penguins; Lovelace is dragged under water, and then they're all pursued by the whales. Upsetting scene when Mumble is trapped inside a zoo and hallucinates seeing his family and friends.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sexy talk and suggestive behavior throughout is open to interpretation -- it may seem racy to an adult but will go over most kids' heads. Strong focus on penguins finding a mate, with the associated implications of finding one another sexually attractive. They must sing a unique \"heart song\" in order to find a mate -- these are all pop songs, many with lyrics that include references to making love, being turned on. Female penguins' shape suggests they have breasts and cleavage. Adelie penguin banter objectifies the females; one thrusts his hips at the \"chicas.\" Lovelace has a group of adoring female singers; they follow him as he says, \"Who's first?\" Mumble bumps into another penguin's private parts. Reference to male penguins not wanting to hug each other. Some innuendoes from a male penguin about female penguins wanting him.\n|Language|: \"Freakin',\" reference to kissing penguins' butts. \"Shut up,\" \"fatty,\" \"idiot,\" \"fool,\" \"go forth and multiply.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768a81999bc0020dccc39": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/happy-feet-two", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sequel to 2006's Academy Award-winning animated adventure Happy Feet features many of the same environmental and family lessons for audiences. Global warming's impact on the penguin characters is again addressed; the peril that comes with natural disasters may frighten the youngest of viewers -- as could some scenes with large/menacing elephant seals and predatory skua birds. There are also a few mild innuendos from the penguin voiced by Robin Williams, and some viewers may interpret the relationship between two male krill as having gay undertones, particularly when Bill suggests they start a swarm of their own. But ultimately this is a tale of family, friendship, and what it means to find your individual voice -- your own special gift.\n|Educational Value|: Kids are likely to pick up on the movie's environmental message about the dangers of global warming, as well as the importance of finding your own voice and encouraging your family and friends.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the original, the sequel features a strong environmental message and also encourages parents to let their children believe in possibilities and follow their passions. Kids will also learn the importance of helping others and how every individual can make a huge impact.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mumble and Gloria are kind, encouraging parents who want Eric to live up to his potential. Eric himself is sweet and believes in others, even though he's not confident at first about his own abilities. A mama penguin thinks of obstacles as challenges to overcome, so her daughter is a fearless young penguin. Bill and Will each go on their own journeys of self discovery that eventually lead them both \"home.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: An iceberg traps the penguins in a snow valley that they can't climb out of, and a couple of times the situation looks dire for them. The krill are eaten by whales and other fish, so Will and Bill realize that they're at the bottom of the food chain. A huge elephant seal looks poised to harm Mumble, Eric, and their pals but then falls off a cliff and requires assistance. Two male seals battle for dominance. The predatory skuas try to peck at the penguin chicks.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Penguin mates Mumble and Gloria embrace. Ramon is smitten with the beautiful Adelie penguin Carmen and calls out to her \"You, me, egg, now!\" in a suggestive way. They flirt throughout the movie.\n|Language|: Insults/language like \"loser,\" \"idiots,\" \"sucks,\" and \"bottom feeders.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the actual movie, but merchandise tie-ins are available in stores.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776833eb5d26001f1e0331": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/happy-gilmore", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that the biggest red flag for this movie is the cursing and violent behavior of Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler). His short fuse results in a number of skirmishes, including an extended (comic) fight scene with Bob Barker. The two brutally pound on each other until Gilmore is eventually knocked unconscious. Another scene has Gilmore threaten another golfer with the shards of a broken beer bottle. The profanity shies away from sexual comments and is composed mostly of \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" Older kids will enjoy Sandler's over-the-top and abrasive humor, as well as the ongoing joke of a golfer's handicapped hand that was eaten by an alligator.\n|Positive Messages|: In its own silly way, the movie shows the importance of controlling one's temper, in golf and in life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although he's shown -- comically -- as a frustrated hockey player trying to learn golf, Happy Gilmore also is a loving grandson who begins to learn to control his emotions.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As a frustrated hockey player, Happy GIlmore frequently (and comically) resorts to violence when he loses his temper. He gets into an over-the-top fistfight with the game show host Bob Barker. He throws a man through a glass door. He also is shown breaking a bottle and threatening to fight the antagonist of the movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: When asked to go to his \"happy place,\" Happy has a fantasy of the lead actress in a park on a bed, dressed in lingerie and holding two pitchers of beer.

In this version, while the teens riding in the Mystery Machine are millennials who use apps as the bad guys make jokes about their assumed love of avocado toast, those familiar with the Scooby-Doo mysteries of previous decades should know what to expect. There's cartoon violence throughout -- much of the movie is an extended vehicle chase where Fred, Daphne, etc. are trying to outrun these \"Jackal Lanterns\" as they appear to be consuming humans in one swallow. The monstrous pumpkins, as well as other demonic-looking bad guys, might be too much for younger or more sensitive viewers. Violence includes explosions, fighting with a scythe, and Fred setting up a series of booby traps with spikes and arrows.

Rowling), has some intense and scary moments. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and friends -- who are only 11 years old here -- are in peril and get hurt, but not seriously, and most of the scares come from fantasy creatures. There's a flashback to the (bloodless) death of Harry's parents and discussion about how they died and the villain who killed them. Characters show courage, teamwork, and loyalty. Friendship, standing up for others, expressing compassion, generosity, perseverance, and the triumph of the underdog are also strong themes.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Plenty examples of courage, teamwork, and loyalty. Friendship, standing up for others, expressing compassion, generosity, perseverance, and the triumph of the underdog are also strong themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione demonstrates the idea behind strength in numbers when it comes to friendship. They're able to work together despite their respective flaws, forgive one another for their mistakes, and overcome great challenges. Hermione is studious and unafraid to express how smart she is, earning admiration of her teachers and eventually peers. Harry stands up for those who've been compassionate toward him, as well as those he feels deserve better treatment; he treats people with respect and loyalty. His generous tendencies encourage viewers to use their experiences with adversity in a positive manner.\n|Diverse Representations|: As one of the most beloved characters in the Harry Potter series, Hermione shines as a multi-dimensional young girl. She's smart and speaks her mind, even when her classmates ridicule her for it. Among the student body at Hogwarts, witches and wizards of color appear, including Harry's fellow Gryffindors Dean Thomas and Lee Jordan, who are both Black. But they have few lines, and their roles aren't central to the plot. Disparities in wealth and privilege are revealed with Ron having less money than Harry, while Draco exudes high-class snobbery, though the issue isn't explored deeply. A Hogwarts teacher Professor Flitwick is played by an actor who was born with the condition spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SED), which caused his dwarfism. The movie, like its source material, plays into fat-phobic stereotypes, depicting villains such as Harry's Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley as gluttonous and less intelligent.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Kids are in peril often, mostly from fantasy creatures. A three-headed dog chases Harry and friends. Harry and Draco see a dead, bloody unicorn and are chased by a hooded figure in the Forbidden Forest. Harry and friends fight a troll and knock it unconscious, are nearly crushed by a constricting plant, are chased by flying keys, and pummeled by a life-sized chess board.

Rowling), and characters spend lots of time in extreme peril. There are frightening creatures, including hordes of big spiders and an enormous snake that can kill anyone who looks in its eyes. Though it appears that some characters have been hurt or killed, all the heroes are ultimately fine. But children who aren't already familiar with the story may be upset. There are also some gross-out moments when Ron's spell backfires and he spits up slugs, and when another misapplied spell leaves Harry without any bones in his forearm.

A charismatically dishonest teacher gets his comeuppance.\n|Diverse Representations|: As Harry's booksmart friend, Hermione demonstrates her cleverness by solving one of the film's key mysteries. Ron's younger sister, Ginny, plays a larger role in this installment, though she requires rescuing. Characters of color, including Harry's fellow Gryffindors Dean Thomas and Lee Jordan (both Black) remain in background. The narrative further explores the issue of class through Lucius Malfoy's mistreatment of his house elf, Dobby. Unfortunately, mirroring its source material, the movie continues to play into fat-phobic stereotypes, depicting villains such as Harry's Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley as gluttonous and cruel.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Kids are in peril often, but at the hand of fantasy creatures most of the time: giant spiders attack, and a basilisk (giant serpent) has Medusa-like abilities, nearly killing characters and putting them in a rigid, comatose state -- it chases Harry in a really tense scene. Harry falls from his broom and breaks his arm, and then bones in his arm are magically removed. A house elf punishes himself by hitting his head repeatedly. In a practice wizards' duel, students and teachers are thrown to the ground and a (small) snake threatens a student. A spell backfires and Ron coughs up slugs. Harry almost falls out of a flying car. Two main characters almost die in the film's climax.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Hermione is called a \"mudblood\" by Draco, an offensive term in the Potter world meaning \"dirty blood.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: While the candy mentioned wasn't originally real, it is now: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Jelly Slugs, and more.

Rowling) is growing up with the Hogwarts crew. The themes are darker, the peril is more intense, and the images of some magical creatures are grotesque and Halloween-ish. For most of the school year, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) believes that he's marked for death and being stalked by an escaped prisoner. He also battles a creature straight out of kids' worst nightmares: The Dementors are black-robed floating beings that suck out happiness and feed on your worst fears, which is why Harry hears the sound of his mother's last scream when he sees them. While this can be tough for younger and sensitive viewers, the bright spot is the Boggart lesson in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Boggarts can turn into what a person fears most, but the kids learn to yell \"Riddikkulus!\" and turn it into something to laugh at.

As the cleverest among her peers, she figures out an important piece of information well before Harry and Ron. Behind the camera, Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n brings a noticeably darker stylistic take on the children's series. Unfortunately, the fat-phobic stereotypes present in the two previous installments are even more exaggerated here when Harry magically inflates Aunt Marge in a spiteful manner. The appearance of a Shrunken Head, who speaks in a Jamaican accent, could be perceived as Othering -- especially since no other Black characters have a significant role in this movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scary images for a PG-rated film. Children are in peril, often at the hands of magical creatures: Dementors (black-robed floating beings that suck the happiness out of people) attack Harry and others, making Harry hear the sound of his mother dying as he passes out; they almost administer \"the kiss of death,\" extracting a character's soul through his mouth. A hippogriff (eagle-horse mix) is provoked and strikes a student; the same creature is executed by a hatchet (heard, not shown). A boggart in a class demonstration changes shape to match what students are most afraid of (and kids learn to fight their fears with laughter). A large dog breaks Ron's leg.

Rowling), and not for nothing. The fourth installment has two deaths (including a really sad one), scary creatures, some romantic yearnings, and edge-of-the-seat scenes. With each film, the scariness quotient increases. This movie features fighting dragons, tortured bugs, a huge booby-trapped maze, and an underwater horror show. Young kids who don't understand the difference between fantasy and reality should stay clear. So should kids going through an anxious time about unnamed terrors or unwanted separations, as one of the death scenes may be extra upsetting. The action is sometimes rowdy, and camera movements/edits are aggressive, all of which increase the scary effects. Romantic tensions ramp up in this installment. Characters demonstrate courage, perseverance, and teamwork, as well as humility and integrity. In addition, friendship, love, bravery, and loyalty are always major themes in the series, as is the idea of making good choices.\n|Positive Messages|: In the ongoing story about good and evil, Harry learns important life lessons in the wake of tragedy. Honesty and integrity are repeatedly at stake.

Harry, in particular, learns the value of integrity and playing fairly. He remains humble, even in the face of his newfound celebrity.\n|Diverse Representations|: Hermione's independence and complexity as a strong female character continue to grow with age. Cho Chang, a British Asian character, is introduced as Harry's love interest. In minor roles, two girls of South Asian descent, sisters Parvati and Padma Patil, are invited by Harry and Ron to the Yule Ball; Angelina Johnson, a Black female student, accepts Fred Weasley's invitation; and Dean Thomas, another Black student, appears without lines. Early in the film, the Quidditch World Cup introduces audiences to the concept of a global wizarding world that includes a delegation of Black wizards dressed in African robes, but the background characters don't speak.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two deaths, including one very stirring death of a teen. No blood is shown, but lifeless bodies are. Children are in peril, often at the hands of magical creatures: dragons burn, chase, and cut Triwizard competitors; mermaids brandish spears as students are held captive underwater. A spider is tortured in a class demonstration. A hand is severed and sacrificed, and Harry is tortured by a curse, writhing in pain.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some references to 14-year-olds' sexual interest; Harry is accosted in the bathtub by a ghostly girl; some couples kiss in the shadows after the Yule Ball.\n|Language|: \"Bloody hell,\" \"piss off,\" and similar words.\n|Products & Purchases|: While Harry Potter merchandise proliferates in the real world, the film only shows characters occasionally spending money. The importance of fashion briefly comes into play as the students get ready for the Yule Ball.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Madame Maxime's horses only drink single-malt whiskey.

Rowling), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has its main characters taking on bigger challenges, with darker themes and more intense danger. The climactic battle scenes with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his minions are downright frightening. Spoiler alert: There's a very upsetting (but bloodless) death of someone near and dear to Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). As a result, Harry grows even more introspective and angry, sometimes demonstrating a lack of self-control and inability to communicate. At the very least, he does enjoy his first kiss, and Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) continue their flirtatious bickering. Harry, his friends, and the Order of the Phoenix members act in a brave, selfless manner, demonstrating perseverance and teamwork. The movie's key lessons are that it's your choices and the actions you take that define you and that friends, family, and love make you more powerful than even the strongest evil.\n|Positive Messages|: Key lessons are that it's your choices and the actions you take that define you and that friends, family, and love make you more powerful than even the strongest evil.\n|Positive Role Models|: Harry's friends bravely agree to practice defensive spells to help him ward off Voldemort and his evil cohorts. In particular, Ron and Hermione refuse to let Harry go up against \"You Know Who\" alone. Harry, his friends, and the Order of the Phoenix members act in a courageous, selfless manner, demonstrating perseverance and teamwork.\n|Diverse Representations|: Strong female characters abound, with several young witches proving themselves extremely capable and skilled. Hermione organizes a group of students to form Dumbledore's Army so  that they can secretly learn and practice defensive spells. Ginny frequently shows off her growing powers. Cho, a British Asian character, continues to play a significant role as Harry's love interest. Also introduces the whimsical yet profoundly observant Luna Lovegood, who befriends Harry at Hogwarts. Adult female characters demonstrate a range of strengths, from the maternal in Ron's mother Mrs. Weasley to Professor McGonagall's fierce protectiveness, while Dolores Umbridge and Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange reveal themselves to be formidable and unforgettable villains. Order of the Phoenix members include Nymphadora Tonks, a witch who can magically change her appearance, and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Black wizard who works in the Ministry of Magic. Main cast remains predominantly White.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scary images of Dementors, Death Eaters, and Lord Voldemort. Angry centaurs drag a character away. Professor Umbridge severely punishes Hogwarts students using a method that appears to be torture. A character is attacked by a large snake, with somewhat bloody results. Depiction of battle at Department of Mysteries is intense, and one key character is killed (though not in a gory way). Harry is painfully inhabited by the Dark Lord; he's also very angry during much of the movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Harry and Cho kiss; Ron and Hermione continue their thinly veiled flirtation through bickering and glancing at each other.\n|Language|: The word \"bloody.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements, but the film franchise includes a ton of merchandising deals, toys, and other tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Harry and his friends meet in a rundown pub in Hogsmeade, but they don't drink anything.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768282e80df001ebdcebc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is extremely edgy for a PG movie -- in all ways, it's very similar to the previous two movies, which were rated PG-13. It continues the Harry Potter series' (all based on the books by J.K. Rowling) trend toward darker, more intense material. For young children, the death of a major beloved character could be extremely upsetting. Other characters are bloodied, kicked, and cursed in frightening ways, and a scene involving zombie-like characters is sure to scare little kids. There are also some big emotional upheavals and violent attacks. And there's notably more sexuality -- albeit playfully depicted -- than in the past movies. Because the characters are now teens, much of the interaction between them and their friends centers on getting a boy- or girlfriend, and there's plenty of snogging (making out). Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends continue as strong positive role models who demonstrate courage, perseverance, and teamwork. Meanwhile, other characters' motives and plans become more ambiguous. There are also a few scenes that include alcohol consumption -- including one in which a professor serves his students.\n|Positive Messages|: Most of the messages are inspiring, since the protagonists are clearly \"heroes\" who accept help from others to overcome obstacles, learn the importance of being loyal to friends, and embody the idea that those who stand together for good can triumph over evil, even at great cost. Themes include courage, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Professor Dumbledore is an excellent, selfless role model. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are flawed teenagers, but that helps make them some of the most relatable characters in children's literature -- as well as admirable, since they're also loyal, brave, self-sacrificing, generous, and empathetic. On the flip side are the Death Eaters and the unreliable, enigmatic character of Severus Snape. Tom Riddle (Voldemort as a boy) is cruel, calculating, cold -- but it's clear that most characters recognize these troubling qualities. Draco Malfoy, who has been \"promoted\" to Death Eater, is still shown as conflicted and scared about the task Voldemort assigns him. Professor Slughorn means well, but his head is turned by fame and fortune. Still, in the end, he manages to be brave.\n|Diverse Representations|: Hermione grows as a strong female character with complex emotions of her own, as does Ginny. Luna Lovegood returns as a supportive friend to Harry. Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, and Bellatrix Lestrange demonstrate a sisterly bond, adding depth to their otherwise villainous characters. Harry flirts with a Muggle waitress who's a young Black woman. Students of color at Hogwarts, including Dean Thomas, Blaise Zabini, and Cho Chang, make appearances but remain on the sidelines. Hogwarts teacher Professor Flitwick is played by an actor who was born with the condition spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SED), which caused his dwarfism.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As in the book, the sixth movie includes the death of a beloved major character (murdered via killing curse). Voldemort himself isn't shown in this film; young Tom Riddle appears instead. Several injuries and close calls: A curse severely bloodies a character, a character is bruised and beaten, two characters are accidentally poisoned, a main character is seen having a life-threatening seizure, Death Eaters set a house on fire and destroy buildings and structures both in the magical realm and in the Muggle world (they also kidnap a Diagon Alley denizen). Harry and Dumbledore must fend off very frightening, skeleton-like creatures during a dangerous mission.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of flirting and \"snogging\" (kissing) among the Hogwarts students, both main characters and extras. Several discussions about attraction, romantic relationships, unrequited feelings, love potions, jealousy, and adolescent dating. Several kisses and instances of hand-holding and longing gazes. Random couples are shown making out in the halls and at parties. Talk of getting together and/or breaking up threads through the whole movie.\n|Language|: Mild insults/British slang like \"daft,\" \"dimbo\" (which means dumb bimbo), \"idiot,\" \"bloody,\" and the like. A couple of uses of phrases like \"good God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Harry and his friends visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop in Diagon Alley. In real life, the film franchise includes a ton of off-screen merchandising deals, toys, and other tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Harry and his underage pals (the legal drinking age in England is 18) drink butterbeer, mead, and what looks like wine at the Three Broomsticks pub and a couple of dinner parties (it's unclear to those not versed in the books whether butterbeer is actually alcoholic). In one scene, as a celebration, a professor offers alcohol to Ron and Harry; the same professor serves drinks to several teens at a holiday party. Harry also takes a \"luck\" potion that alters his behavior in a way that seems slightly high, and Ron is thrown for a loop by a powerful love potion. Professor Slughorn and Hagrid get pretty deep into their cups in one scene.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768385af944001f1fac9c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-1", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the second-to-last installment in the epic Harry Potter movie saga (all based on the books by J.K. Rowling) is the darkest, most intense yet. It has the highest body count of any Potter film, including the deaths of several recurring characters -- some of which are particularly emotional and upsetting. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and their friends are bloodied, injured, and cursed. In one startling \"jump\" scene, Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) giant killer snake bursts out of an old woman's body; there's also a particularly disturbing torture scene in which a major character is branded with an insult. Expect lots of longing looks and protective embraces between Ron and Hermione, a passionate snog between Harry and Ginny (Bonnie Wright), and a scene of \"ghost\" versions of Harry and Hermione tormenting Ron with a sensual kiss (they appear to be nude, and you can see their torsos, but it's quite blurry/misty). Despite the amped-up angst and violence, the characters prove again and again that unconditional friendship, loyalty, and love can survive even the most harrowing of threats. Courage, perseverance, and teamwork remain core themes.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages include the idea that every hero needs help to defeat evil; that \"blood status\" (the magical equivalent of racial purity) isn't important; that all kinds of people -- magical and non-magical -- should be able to co-exist peacefully; and that some things, some battles are greater than one person. Hermione's choice to stay with Harry even though she loves Ron shows the importance of staying true to your word and the possibility and power of redemption. Themes include courage, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Harry, Hermione, Ron, and all the members of the Order of the Phoenix are positive role models -- they use teamwork, perseverance, and courage against the scariest villains and toughest of odds. By defying his former masters, Dobby shows free will, loyalty, and friendship. Even though Voldemort's cronies have taken over the Ministry, the actions of the Order, the central trio, and Dobby are strong examples of how even the humblest creatures can do amazing things.\n|Diverse Representations|: Hermione takes center stage alongside Harry and Ron as the trio seeks to fulfill Dumbledore's mission. She repeatedly demonstrates her abilities as a capable and quick-thinking witch, while also expressing a range of emotions in response to the increasingly complex relationships with her two closest friends. Ginny and Luna Lovegood play supporting roles. Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange return as wickedly entertaining villains. Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Black member of the Order of the Phoenix, briefly appears.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The body count in this movie is the highest of all the adaptations to date. Several characters -- mostly recurring supporting players, but also a couple of newly introduced ones -- are killed, mostly via the Killing Curse. One beloved character dies after suffering a bloody knife wound. While on the run, the central trio is each injured -- Hermione is tortured, Ron's shoulder is severely hurt, and Harry nearly drowns while being choked by a cursed locket. A character loses his ear to a Death Eater (bloody wound visible). Muggle-born characters are shown being whisked away against their will -- toruture/mistreatment is implied. The good guys face down Death Eaters, Dementors, Snatchers, and, in one gruesome scene, a man-eating snake that bursts out of a dead body. Weapons include wands and fists in most of those fights.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Ginny asks Harry to zip up her dress, and then turns around and exposes a strip of bare back (all the way down to her waist) to him. They then kiss. Lots of flirting and longing looks, as well as embraces between Ron and Hermione. An evil, ghostly version of Harry and Hermione torment Ron by embracing and kissing passionately while appearing nearly nude (their torsos are visible, but it's all very blurry/misty).\n|Language|: Frequent use of British slang like \"bloody,\" \"bleeding,\" and \"git,\" plus \"damn,\" \"piss,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" and \"oh my God\" said once or twice. The insults \"Mudblood\" and \"blood traitor\" -- which are the wizarding world's equivalent of nasty racist terms -- are said several times as well.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne glasses are magically filled at a wedding reception, and people eating at a large dinner table are shown with goblets in front of them, but no one is really drinking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776838151a60001f24e81b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that the epic finale of the Harry Potter movie saga (all based on the books by J.K. Rowling), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, is the deadliest, most intense, and most touching installment of the lot. Because the majority of the movie is an all-out battle between Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his army against Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his allies at Hogwarts, there's an extremely high body count -- including the deaths of several beloved supporting characters. Most happen off camera, but several bodies are shown. In a few scenes, everyone is bloodied and injured or dead, and it's brutal to watch (a shot of dead goblins is particularly gruesome, and one character's death at the fangs of an evil snake gets pretty gory). Despite the raging battle, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) at last find a moment to snog and spend most of the movie holding on to each other; Harry and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) also share a quick kiss. And in the end, it's not the violence that viewers will take away, but the idea that every hero, no matter how brave, needs loyal friends to defeat evil and that love lives on even in the face of death. Themes include courage, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: As with all of the Harry Potter movies, there are many positive messages, including the idea that every hero needs help to defeat evil; that everyone has a choice to do what's right, even if it's not easy; that some battles are greater than one person; that friends stand by each other until the end; and so much more. And the Forbidden Forest sequence demonstrates how those we love always live on in our hearts, even after they're dead.\n|Positive Role Models|: Harry, Hermione, Ron, their Hogwarts friends, the Order of the Phoenix, and most of Hogwarts' professors are all positive role models -- they work together to fight Voldemort and his army, demonstrating teamwork, perseverance, and courage. As the titular hero, Harry is willing to sacrifice his life to save the wizarding world, but so is everyone who fights on his side, including some characters who surprise us with their bravery. Dumbledore's spirit returns to remind us once more that it's the choices we make that make all the difference. Different characters' choices illustrate selflessness, unexpected conscience, finding the courage to express love, and the idea that people aren't always what they seem.\n|Diverse Representations|: Hermione plays an integral role working with Harry and Ron to defeat Lord Voldemort. Female witches of all ages join the battle against the Death Eaters, including Luna, Ginny, Mrs. Weasley, and Professor McGonagall. Narcissa Malfoy shows just how far a mother will go to protect her child. The main trio's return to Hogwarts means more visibility for characters of color, including Cho Chang, Padma Patil, Dean Thomas, and Blaise Zabini. Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Black member of the Order, also shows up. Otherwise, the main cast is predominantly White. Griphook, along with the other goblins at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, unfortunately embodies anti-Semitic tropes. He and Professor Flitwick are played by the same actor, who was born with the condition spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SED), which caused his dwarfism.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This is by far the deadliest of the eight Potter films, with the highest body count and many upsetting deaths. Because the movie depicts the Battle of Hogwarts, the death toll is in the hundreds, including some favorite supporting characters. Their bodies are shown (eyes open, unmoving). The Gringotts break-in not only destroys the bank but also sparks bloody retribution from Voldemort (dead goblins are shown sprawled out). The Killing Curse is used, an evil snake kills an important character in a pretty gory scene with multiple bites and body slams, and a bully is enveloped in fire. Some bodies seem to disintegrate or burst. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends face Death Eaters, Dementors, giants, huge spiders -- the whole of You Know Who's army. In one ethereal scene, the remains of a body are depicted as a gruesome newborn-like creature. Harry willingly faces death at one point in the movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: After seven movies, Ron and Hermione finally kiss -- as well as hold hands, embrace, and protect/comfort each other in a romantic manner. A married couple holds hands before a battle. Harry and Ginny share a brief kiss, and one character proclaims his intent to tell a girl he fancies her, since they might be dead in a few hours.\n|Language|: Molly Weasley's famous line: \"Not my daughter, you bitch!\" is included verbatim, and a few characters (mostly Ron) say British slang like \"bloody hell,\" \"prat,\" and \"numpty.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: There's no product placement in the movie, but Harry Potter-related merchandise is a huge money maker for Warner Bros. and J.K.

Each character has a well-defined, quirky personality and usually a very \"punny\" name (i.e., Cluck Norris, Meryl Cheeks, Hugh Heifer, Tiny SchwarzHENegger). Many scenes include cartoon action with firecrackers, falling melons, balloon aircraft crashes, and the vulture's cackling, menacing behavior. A weasel throws knives at a hero, but none lands its mark. No one is hurt or killed. Though meant for young kids, it's important that those who watch are clear about the differences between make-believe and real violence. Solid (and repetitive) messages about friendship and working together are promoted throughout. Though the main \"save the farm\" story is clear, there are several tangential plot lines that muddy the waters a bit -- electing a mayor, rats on the hunt for food, three young chick heroes who want to be the first chickens to fly, and an alien who works magic with technology.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Strongly advocates friendship. \"Friends stand up for each other, no matter what.\" Farm animals band together to keep the farm safe.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroes exhibit courage, determination, and loyalty on a mission to defend their farm.

Expect more language than in the typical romcom (\"f--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" etc.), but the movie is still likely to appeal to teens thanks to the stars and the enduring popularity of Sally Thorne's best-selling source novel on social media (including the now prevalent #BookTok). The movie's kissing and sex scenes are less explicit than the ones in the book, but one does show a man's naked behind, and there's passionate kissing and some fairly explicit sexual references. Adults drink cocktails at dinners, dates, and receptions. Although the movie -- which is set in New York City (unlike the ambiguously located novel) -- is slightly more diverse than the book, it's still mostly White, which doesn't accurately reflect its setting. Themes include the importance of healthy communication, especially with a romantic partner.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't judge someone based on an inaccurate first impression; learn to communicate in a healthy way with a romantic partner; don't let others undermine your self-confidence; be open about your relationship needs. Even those who seem to have it all together need reassurance and support.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lucy is hardworking, dedicated, generous, kind, and loyal. Joshua is organized, disciplined, and ambitious. Both of them are exemplary at their jobs, despite their disparate styles. Once they get over their miscommunications and really talk through their issues, each sees how the other is good for them. Helen is a supportive and caring boss, but Bexley is a sexist \"good ol' boy\" who dismisses Lucy and Helen.\n|Diverse Representations|: The movie centers White, heterosexual, able-bodied characters, despite being set in the very diverse New York City. There's little racial, ethnic, LGBTQ+, or any other form of diversity, but the few representations that are included -- Lucy's boss, Helen, is a woman of color (indeterminate ethnicity); her co-worker Julie is Black (albeit portrayed as flakey and unreliable); and the company's HR director is Black -- are more than were in the source novel.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comical violence during a game of paintball that leaves Lucy bruised (purple and blue bruising on her abdomen).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In one love scene, Josh is shown wearing only a low-slung towel, which Lucy takes off him. His naked butt is visible, and she gasps at his naked body. They make love; his bare back is shown, but she keeps her dress on. In the next scene, they're in bed with bare shoulders. Lucy has an erotic dream about Josh in which, he -- fully dressed in a suit -- gets on top of her in bed and says something naughty in her ear. They discuss the dream, but not that he was in it. Lucy kisses another character three times in quick succession on a date. Lucy and Josh kiss passionately on several occasions and end up on a bed more than once. Sexual innuendo/overt references in conversations, like \"I'm going to work you so f--king hard\" or \"let's play the who can make the other one come first game,\" or \"let's just do it.\"\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"douche,\" \"d--k,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"donkey farts,\" \"nitwit in a pushup bra,\" and other insults.\n|Products & Purchases|: Apple MacBook, Dell computer, iPhone, Smurfs heavily featured.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink wine, champagne, and cocktails at bars, dinners, and receptions. A bride and a guest joke about needing a joint (or meth, or any drug) to get through a wedding reception.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776835880197001ec93607": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-haunted-mansion", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Haunted Mansion is a 2003 movie starring Eddie Murphy as a real estate agent and father of a family who ends up trapped in an old estate filled with ghosts, demons, and zombies. There are many chase scenes involving peril to young kids; these, and the atmospherics of the crypt scenes, might scare younger viewers. The mother of the movie is told she committed suicide in a past life, and this moment is interspersed with the quick image of a woman hanging dead from a noose. A ghost is dragged into a fiery pit while other ghosts dematerialize to ascend into the heavens. Younger children might be scared when the parents are threatened. Eddie Murphy's character makes reference to a ghost trying to \"get jiggy\" with his wife. Profanity includes \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"Christ,\" \"damn,\" and \"crap.\"\n|Positive Messages|: The importance of making your family a greater priority than career.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the characters are too one-dimensional to be seen as positive role models, the father learns to put his family and marriage before his career, and the son learns to be brave.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scary and spooky with creepy and grisly images.

The movie's ultimate messages are positive ones about self-respect and creating healthy boundaries in an online world, but the film also has lots of strong language (\"f--king,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"d--k,\" and more), sexual references, and some not-very-nice behavior among teens. Classmates cheat on each other and scheme to undermine each other. They bet on the challenge of turning a \"loser\" into a prom king, there's mention of online and real-life bullying, and two boys engage in a knockout fight. Some characters chronicle their entire lives online, forgetting to live \"in real life.\" A girl walks in on her boyfriend \"hooking up\" with another girl. This is caught on film, and she's demonized for her reaction, while the boyfriend's popularity only increases. There's a double entendre about \"riding,\" plus kissing, sexual references, and innuendo. The main characters learn valuable lessons about themselves, and there's some welcome diversity in their friend group, though most of the high schoolers portrayed here are wealthy (one throws herself a massive theme party at her mansion, where kids come in elaborate costumes and drink \"mocktails\"). Another teen appears to be selling drugs on campus.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't judge people by their popularity, manicured online images, or number of followers: These are superficial. It's important to be yourself and respect yourself. \"It's only a mistake if you don't learn from it.\" High school is said to be a place full of scared people pretending they're not. There are more important things in life than being prom king or queen. A character references the \"shallowness of the ruling class.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Teenagers cheat on each other, scheme to undermine each other. They bet on the challenge of turning a \"loser\" into a prom king. Some chronicle their entire lives online. They throw lavish parties for themselves, are snobby about their wealth, teasing a friend about her more modest home and lack of car. Padgett learns value of being true to herself. Cameron learns to open up to people. Padgett is saving up for college, but Cameron thinks college is a waste of time. Cameron and his sister have a loving relationship in the absence of their parents.\n|Diverse Representations|: Secondary characters represent different races, ethnicities, sexual orientations. A high schooler with a shaved head and piercings critiques the \"antiquated heteronormative concept\" of prom king and queen.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Padgett's mom recounts some of what she's seen in the ER the night before, including a meth addict and a toddler with something stuck up their nose. A student catches his arm on fire in a school chemistry lab. A girl falls off a horse and is fine. A boy describes some bullying he's experienced at school. A girl has to weather being the source of ridicule online. Cameron describes how his mom died in a plane crash. Two teen boys engage in a fight; one uses martial arts to topple the other. A high school principal jokes about slapping an annoying student. Cameron's sister manages to fend off an older boy trying to get fresh with her after they've been kissing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Padgett walks in on her boyfriend \"hooking up\" with another girl.

Both male and female characters conform to fairly standard romcom \"types,\" and while the movie attempts to shed fresh light on the ups and downs of dating, it all boils down to how men and women long for someone to love. Expect some mild nudity (nothing sensitive shown), swearing, and social drinking. The question of whether or not one character is smoking in secret plays a significant role in the movie. One storyline deals with infidelity, and there are a few heated exchanges between couples.\n|Positive Messages|: Ultimately the movie reinforces the idea that being in a relationship is the key to happiness -- an iffy message at best. Many different types of relationships are portrayed, with different levels of happiness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both male and female characters are somewhat stereotypical -- many of the men are portrayed as especially callow -- and both genders are shown having problems reading the other's signals and sending mixed messages. One male character is brutally honest in evaluating a woman's love life, but she ultimately appreciates and learns from his candor. Some characters seem to believe that getting married and/or being in a relationship is the only way to be happy. One character has an affair.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Couples yell in a few scenes; in a fit of rage, a woman throws a mirror on the floor and breaks it.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couples kiss, make out, and discuss sex. A woman disrobes off-camera and jumps into the water to skinny dip after she propositions a married man, though viewers don't actually see any sensitive body parts. A couple kisses and fondles each other in an office; later, a woman straddles a man in the same office and they presumably make love (but it's not shown).\n|Language|: Language includes several \"s--t\"s, a couple of uses of \"f--k,\" \"suck,\" \"ass,\" \"bullsh--t,\" \"a--holes,\" \"boobs,\" \"dick,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands/logos for cigarettes (American Spirit is particularly prominent), beer, and a few other products (Crest WhiteStrips) are shown.

The movie, like the book, proposes that, during surgery, young Colton (who never died on the operating table) somehow visited heaven, proving that the afterlife exists. While there's not much questionable content in the movie overall, a few scenes show characters in pain or injured, and there's one scene in which the Burpos' school-aged daughter punches two boys making fun of her brother. There's also a fair bit of kissing and marital affection (though certainly nothing that could be considered graphic), as well as one suggestive (but unheard) comment. Young kids may not understand some of the movie's mature issues, and some families may feel more comfortable with the religious subject matter than others.\n|Positive Messages|: The power of faith is a central theme of the film, which encourages viewers to consider their own beliefs. It also provides a positive depiction of a happily married couple who aren't bored or unhappy with their marriage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Todd is an engaging orator, a kind pastor, and a loving husband and father. Colton is matter-of-fact about his experiences and doesn't say anything to try to change anyone's mind; he's sure of himself. The Burpos have a strong and faithful marriage that's portrayed as affectionate and passionate, even though they don't always agree.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A grown man falls and suffers a painful fracture during a softball game; he later has debilitating kidney stones that cause him to collapse in public and scream in pain. A boy has a near-fatal case of appendicitis. A girl punches two boys who make fun of her brother.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several kisses and embraces between a married couple.

The film also takes on some mature themes, including the crumbling of a marriage and the mourning period that comes when a relationship breaks apart. Expect some swearing (including \"f--k\"), and scenes where a character has loud, enthusiastic sex with a voice. There's a bit of quick topless nudity and some sexy moments between adults.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's depiction of love is profound and moving, and shows us that love can happen in strange ways, not always when we're looking for it, and that it can change us deeply if we can be open to it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Theodore may be dazed by his divorce and confused by his feelings for Samantha, but he nevertheless opens himself up to the experience.

There's a lot of gore and intense, scary stuff for a G-rated movie, including gruesome monsters and end-of-the-world images (floods, fires, ice storms, mass destruction) that might overshadow the more lighthearted musical components. Some kids may also be confused or even upset about the underworld and what happens when people die.\n|Educational Value|: Kids who are unfamiliar with the Greek gods and goddesses will get an introduction to Zeus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Hades. Hercules is also an actual mythological figure, though few of the heroic tales in the movie are in line with those in his mythical tale.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overarching message is about learning what it means to be a real hero -- as opposed to a celebrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hercules is initially motivated to be a hero by rather selfish, if understandable, motives: He wants to become a god so that he can be with his real parents. But overall, he's a nice guy who suffers a betrayal. On the other hand, the portrayal of Hades as a slick power broker with a hooked nose who makes deals and uses Yiddish words plays on unnecessary stereotypes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hades is a slimy, terrifying guy whose sharp teeth and hot temper are likely to frighten the youngest viewers. Hercules fights monsters, decapitating a hydra from inside of its long neck, only to watch it grow a bunch of more heads and attack him. Dead bodies are shown in the underworld and dying people are shown floating in a sea of death. Apocalyptic scenes, characters in peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Meg is forced to handle Hercules \"like a man\" if she wants her freedom. Hercules and Meg share a couple of long kisses.

Even though it deals with a violent sport, there's not too much blood, although there are plenty of bruises, injuries, and hand-to-hand (and foot!) combat. Language and romance are tame (sparing use of words like \"ass\" and \"hell\" for the former; some flirting, a date, and one kiss for the latter ), and the messages support the importance of arts education and standing up for what you believe in.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a movie about teachers recapturing what inspires them about educating -- and the idea that one person can make a difference. There's also a positive message about the importance of music education in public schools. And, of course, to always follow your dreams.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mr. Streb is a fabulous music teacher who's invested in his students, repairs instruments for lower-income students, and is generally known as a superstar teacher. Mr. Voss starts out uninterested in his teaching career but ends up recommitting himself to his students and to what motivated him to become a teacher in the first place.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Mixed Martial Arts training sessions and competitions are realistically brutal. Although they're occasionally comedic, they definitely leave Mr. Voss (and his opponents) punched, scraped, bruised, and injured (sometimes with blood). MMA is up close and hand-to-hand, and there's lots of kicking and punching. Two incidents of vomiting -- which is gross but then becomes comedic.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mr. Voss flirts with Mrs. Flores every chance he gets, and at the very end he gets his kiss. Salma Hayek wears a couple of cleavage-revealing but not overly risque tops.\n|Language|: A couple of uses of \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" and \"oh my God,\" plus some scatological humor (the vomiting) and mild insults: \"stupid,\" \"sucks,\" \"loser,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: A few product placements, like Wise potato chips, World's Deadliest Car Chases, Triumph motorcycle, Affliction clothing, Columbia fleece jacket, Diet Coke.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d9947dd6e001f6f48ea": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hereditary", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Hereditary is an extremely dark, creepy horror movie with ghosts, seances, death, burned bodies, severed heads, a deadly car accident, maggots, flies, ants, blood, and scenes of rage, screaming, and panic.

Weird, ghostly apparitions sometimes appear naked (full-frontal, both male and female), but only briefly. Occasional language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and \"hell.\" It's quite intense -- and very scary -- and it's all just a bit more serious and intense than the usual horror movie, making it hard to recommend for any but the most mature viewers. Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne, and Alex Wolff co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Briefly ponders whether problematic traits are passed along through bloodlines, but it's ultimately much more about being a victim.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters are all realistically troubled -- sometimes kind, sometimes upset, sometimes selfish.

Though the couple was romanticized in a classic 1967 film, Bonnie and Clyde, this new film serves to portray the meticulous, determined Frank Hamer and his partner, Maney Gault, two retired Texas Rangers who actually led the successful effort to end the violent crime spree. Other than a wild gun battle that occurs during a prison escape, the movie avoids the young couple's actual crimes, opting to show the aftermath of their sociopathic behavior (i.e., bodies left behind). The climactic sequence is a literal depiction of the actual event: when hundreds of bullets found their targets in a car on a country road. It's a very violent, bloody sequence. Moderate cursing is heard throughout, including \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" and \"hell\" as well as insults: \"high-flying sissy,\" \"gimp.\" One leading character, known to have a problem with alcohol, drinks in secret in multiple scenes. Characters smoke cigarettes. A notable element in the film, one that might inspire thoughtful discussion, is the celebrity status given the two killers ... perhaps a glimpse of infamous media stars in later years. Mature teens only.\n|Positive Messages|: With perseverance, resourcefulness, and courage, good triumphs over evil. Addresses \"celebrity\" in its most heinous form.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroes are unassuming, professional, relentless pursuers whose efforts are rewarded.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Gunplay, machine gun fire, bloody bodies strewn on highways. A prison escape results in the death of a guard. Climactic scene is a blood bath -- two villains under assault killed in a car.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Occasional swearing includes \"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"son of a bitch.\" Insults: \"gimp,\" \"high-flying sissy.\" A man urinates off-camera.\n|Products & Purchases|: Coca-Cola. A number of gun manufacturers are mentioned.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One hero has issues with alcohol abuse, is seen drinking.

Hitch starts out the movie as a suave \"pick-up artist\" who teaches socially awkward guys how to meet and woo the girl of their dreams. As the movie goes on, it debates whether \"date doctors\" like him are manipulative creeps teaching underhanded techniques to lonely guys, or if what he's offering is a chance for nice guys who never seem to \"get the girl\" to overcome their shyness and lack of self-confidence and get dates. The answer to this debate, borne out of the direct experiences of the characters in the movie, suggests that love and attraction can't be won with formulas and guidelines. There's one male character who is very sleazy and tries to enlist Hitch to help him \"bang\" a woman for a one-night stand. There is some profanity, including \"f--k.\" A woman chugs a bottle of wine while in the middle of an argument with a potential romantic interest.\n|Positive Messages|: Love conquers all. While some would say that the techniques and methods that Hitch teaches to socially awkward men as a \"date doctor\" is manipulative and creepy, Hitch makes the argument that what he's doing is giving nice guys a chance to find love in the cruel world of dating, and he has the thank you cards and wedding pictures to prove it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters go through most of the movie as cynics who don't believe in enduring love, or are too one-dimensional to be role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comic peril. A sleazy guy is kicked in the crotch by the lead female character. The lead character jumps on the roof of his love interest's car to try and win her love -- he's thrown off the car and rolls off the hood and onto the street -- no serious injuries. One character tries choking the other during a misunderstanding.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Talk of an unpleasant one-night stand. References made to lead character's prowess with seducing women. A sleazy character openly admits that he just wants to use a woman for sex.\n|Language|: Occasional strong language, including \"f--k.\" \"A--hole,\" \"s--t,\" \"pissing,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn.\" Sleazy guy talks to lead character about how he just wants to \"bang\" a girl he's attracted to.\n|Products & Purchases|: Altoids, Benadryl, Krispy Kreme, and Grey Goose vodka mentioned by name or shown in some of the scenes.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking in bars.

Jackson plays an infamous hit man, while Ryan Reynolds plays a bodyguard-for-hire. Not surprisingly, there's tons of gun use; expect frequent shoot-outs with automatic/semi-automatic weapons, as well as explosions, close-up brawls/killings, and an enormous body count. But, thanks to the stars, there's also a whole lot of humor ... as well as nonstop cursing, particularly \"f--k\" and \"motherf----r.\" There are underlying themes of teamwork and redemption, but the plot also includes disturbing scenes related to a genocidal Belarusian dictator (Gary Oldman) whom Jackson is supposed to testify against. The tyrant is known for committing widespread murder of any man, woman, or child he considered an enemy. A few scenes show drinking and kissing, as well as lingering shots of women's bodies, but violence and language are the main issues here.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the violence and the humor are messages about teamwork, forgiveness, and redemption -- though the story does focus on two men who use guns professionally: one to kill and one to protect.\n|Positive Role Models|: It's hard to consider a hit man/contract killer and a bodyguard-for-hire role models, but they're at least aware of morality and have rules about who they kill. Kincaid refuses to kill for a dictator when he realizes the man has ordered and participated in the shooting of a village. Bryce doesn't kill people unless he has to, and his job is more to keep someone alive than to kill anyone. They both love the women in their lives.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Both main characters use their guns a ton, and the movie's body count is ridiculously high. Several disturbing scenes of a country's leader ordering the deaths of or directly killing people, including a dissident professor's wife and children (it happens off camera, but viewers see the gun being pointed at them and two shots). Many, many shoot-outs and car chases that leave people dead.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Both Kincaid and Bryce have flashbacks in which they recall how they met their significant others, and both sequences involve close-ups of the women's bodies (there's much more in the one featuring Salma Hayek -- i.e., cleavage and butt shots). Two different couples kiss.\n|Language|: Constant use of strong language, with expletives (mostly \"f--k\" and \"motherf----r\") peppered throughout. Other words said quite often include \"bitch,\" \"p---y,\" \"d--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"Jesus Christ,\" \"Christ,\" goddammit,\" and \"retard,\" as well as Spanish curses like \"hijo de puta,\" \"mierda,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: BMW, Ford, Range Rover, Land Rover, Jaguar, Mercedes.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Kincaid drinks liquor from a flask. People at a bar are shown drinking, mostly beer.

It re-teams Ryan Reynolds (as uptight, safety-first bodyguard Michael Bryce, who's still trying to regain his Triple-A certification), Samuel L. Jackson (as high-level assassin Darius Kincaid), and Salma Hayek (as Kincaid's wife, Sonia). As in the original, profanity flies as frequently as bullets (\"f--k\" is in practically every sentence). The body count is sky-high, with constant gunfire, stabbings, graphic headshots (and other wounds), and physical fights. While the first film was about Kincaid helping Bryce realize that some matters are out of his control, the goal this time around is making Bryce less responsible and more comfortable with killing. Equating masculinity with brutality (e.g., \"men don't cry\" and \"men shoot stuff up\"), the movie makes Bryce's emotional fragility the butt of the joke. And while Sonia is just as violent and profane as the guys, she's called \"crazy\" because her actions and words are more emotionally reactive. The Kincaids are honeymooning and are actively trying to get pregnant no matter where they are, although nothing more than making out and an over-the-blouse fondle is actually shown. There's some drinking, a character is drugged for laughs, and cocaine is talked about as if using it is a rite of passage to being cool.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the violence and the humor is a message about embracing who you are, not seeking validation from others. But there's also a tendency to equate masculinity with brutality, and a character's efforts to restore his mental health are made fun of throughout.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lead characters are shown to be smart, super skilled, and savvy -- but they're also callous about violence and killing people and not intended as role models. Women are depicted as intelligent and capable in a traditionally male-dominated industry. Racial diversity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very high body count -- often at hands of lead characters. Shoot-outs, stabbings, explosions, physical fights, being hit with a blunt instrument. Many gun shots through the head and body. One character is repeatedly hit by a car.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Amorous married couple makes out, including breast-fondling, speaking bluntly about sex, and having sex (bodies mostly blocked from view). A couple of brief moments of Sonia in lingerie-type outfits. Cleavage seen on several occasions.\n|Language|: Extremely strong profanity throughout: \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"boobs,\" \"d--k,\" \"goddammit,\" \"p---y,\" \"s--t,\" and very frequent use of \"f--k\" and \"motherf----r.\" Middle-finger gesture. \"Jesus Christ!\" used as an expletive. Character called \"crazy.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Range Rover vehicles featured. Jaguar, Gucci, and Valentino mentioned, seen as aspirational. Villains shown as having wealth, but it's made clear that love and friendship are more important than money.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Comments indicating that cocaine is cool.

Tolkien's stand-alone quest through Middle-earth, is less violent than the scarier Lord of the Rings trilogy. But there are definitely some frightening sequences, like the battle between the dragon and the dwarves of Erebor, during which one character is decapitated, another has an arm amputated, and there's mass destruction. The group of Bilbo, Gandalf, and 13 dwarves is often tracked and pursued and nearly killed several times, but they manage to avoid death -- at least in this installment. Bilbo (like Frodo and his friends in the LOTR movies) again shows that size doesn't matter when it comes to making a difference.\n|Positive Messages|: As in The Lord of the Rings, the message of The Hobbit is that even the smallest person can make a huge difference. Gandalf even says \"it's the small things that keep the darkness at bay\" in reference to Bilbo's involvement in the dangerous mission. Gandalf advises Bilbo that it's not knowing how to take a life that takes courage but knowing when to spare one. The dwarves' quest reminds viewers of the importance of home, kinship, and belonging somewhere. Curiosity, perseverance, and teamwork are major themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: No one except Gandalf thinks that Bilbo can be of much help, but Bilbo rises to the occasion by summoning his courage when the time calls for it -- except for the fact that he fulfills his destiny as a \"burglar\" by stealing Gollum's precious ring. Thorin is dedicated to his fellow dwarves, and they in return revere him as their faithful leader.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Less violent than The Lord of the Rings, but there's still some carnage: a battle between the dwarves and the dragon leads to the dwarf king being decapitated, an orc leader's arm amputated, and a multitude of dwarves and their property destroyed. There are several close calls when Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves are pursued or nearly die on their journey across Middle-earth, usually by orcs and their beasts. The orc leader is a frightening sight -- particularly with his claw-like prosthesis, and he's bloodthirsty. A group of goblins/orcs tries to kill the group as well.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Slang use of \"jaxie\" (meaning \"ass\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Although there are no product placements in Middle-earth, the Tolkien books and Peter Jackson film adaptations have spawned a ton of merchandise: apparel, video games, LEGO toys and board games, role-playing games, special movie tie-in editions of the books, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The dwarves are a voracious lot -- even more than hobbits. They ransack Bilbo's pantry and consume large quantities of drink (and food). Gandalf and Bilbo smoke the mellowing pipeweed.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77697d47dd6e001f6c6178": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final (and most violent) installment in director Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel -- and, as the title suggests, it features the biggest battle sequences of the trilogy. The most like The Lord of the Rings, this finale is all about epic confrontations: between Thorin Oakenshield who has finally reclaimed the mountain kingdom of Erebor for the dwarves, the elves and humans who want their rightful share of his treasure, and Sauron's orc army that's a threat to them all. This movie has the highest body count in the trilogy; all of the armies sustain losses, and many characters -- primary, secondary, and extras -- die, either in battle (via arrows, axes, swords) or from dragon fire. Some of the death scenes are brutal and particularly sad or disturbing, but ultimately this is a must-see for any family that has already seen the first two Hobbit films.\n|Positive Messages|: Even the smallest can be strong -- and the weak can be courageous. Reinforces the importance of keeping your word/promise/oath and of helping those in need rather than believing it's not your problem. Thorin's obsession with his treasure shows the corrupting power of wealth. As someone says in the movie, the world would be a merrier place if people valued other people above gold.\n|Positive Role Models|: Many characters must rise to the occasion and decide whether to band together or think only of their own people. Bilbo stands up to Thorin and enlist help for the people of Lake Town. Bard leads the people of Lake Town to relative safety. The elf king allows the elves to fight even if it's not in their best interest. Tauriel may be the most skilled female ever in a Tolkien adaptation. Legolas fights honorably to defend the dwarves (and Tauriel) despite his jealousy and disappointments. Thorin becomes obsessed with his treasure to the exclusion of anything else. Characters demonstrate curiosity, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The most violent of the Hobbit films: Huge battles with high body counts and brutal deaths. Many beloved characters die fighting their enemies (usually with swords and arrows), as do villains. Smaug kills countless residents of Lake Town as he murderously destroys it, setting fire to anything and anyone in his flight path. Some frightening, jump-worthy moments include Smaug cruelly targeting a man's young son (the dragon doesn't have a chance to kill him), the super Orcs battling the dwarves, Thorin threatening Bilbo, and the elves/wizards fighting the shadow of Sauron. Lots of intense, deadly confrontations between characters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kili and Tauriel continue their lingering looks and charged moments of connection, including an embrace, an \"almost kiss,\" and a heartbreaking declaration of love. Legolas loves Tauriel, even if she doesn't return his romantic affection.\n|Language|: Insults: \"coward,\" \"stinking liar,\" \"thief,\" \"burglar.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the film, but the Tolkien books and Peter Jackson film adaptations have plenty of tie-ins to merchandise: apparel, video games, Lego toys and board games, role-playing games and costumes, special editions of the books, electronics accessories, posters and other home accessories, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Gandalf smokes a pipe more than once.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77689aebdf2200209c3571": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Desolation of Smaug is the second installment in director Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of The Hobbit. Unlike the streamlined adaptations of each of the three Lord of the Rings novels, The Hobbit is expanded beyond the source material with additional characters and story lines. While this series remains more tween-friendly than the more violent Lord of the Rings, there are still a few jump-worthy and frightening scenes, mostly dealing with the orcs, the dragon Smaug, and that most evil of beings, Sauron. Viewers with a fear of spiders may find some scenes difficult to watch. Bows are the weapons of choice, but hammers, swords, and other forged weapons are also used in the fight scenes (in addition to the dragon's built-in weapon of all-consuming fire).\n|Positive Messages|: The story continues with its message that even the smallest and seemingly weakest can have courage when it counts. Dwarves are small but strong warriors. Bilbo gains his confidence even as he cultivates his attachment to his secret ring. The importance of helping others is paramount to the story: two elves defy their leaders to help creatures they don't even particularly care about; a man helps the dwarves in a moment of need. Additional themes include curiosity, teamwork, and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Many of the characters face difficult decisions. Bilbo must use his stolen ring to be invisible and help the dwarves. Thorin wants to lead his fellow dwarves to their homeland, but he's willing to sacrifice Bilbo's life if necessary; Tauriel disobeys the elvenking's orders in order to help the dwarves and fight the orcs; Bard helps the dwarves but doesn't want them to awaken the dragon that could lead to his lake town's destruction. Tauriel, a captain of the guard, is even more skilled than Eowyn and Arwen from the LOTR trilogy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There a few jumpworthy moments courtesy of the orcs and the dragon Smaug. Audiences of all ages will be on the edge of their seats at least three times when dangerous, scary characters pop up on the screen. While it's not as violent as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there are deadly confrontations between the dwarves and the orcs, the elves and the orcs, and the dragon and the dwarves. Orcs are killed (one is decapitated); one dwarf is pierced with a poisoned arrow and nearly dies; Smaug spews fire toward Bilbo and the dwarves and is buried in a sea of molten gold. Sauron is very frightening and smothers Galdalf with his evil darkness. Beorn is a skinchanger that changes from a giant man into a terrifying bear-like beast. Giant spiders are sure to creep out sensitive viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Both Legolas and Kili are smitten with the beautiful elf Tauriel. Kili asks her if she isn't going to check down his trousers for weapons, because she might find something; she responds \"or nothing.\" Kili and Tauriel hold hands.\n|Language|: Some insults including \"coward,\" \"rabble rousers,\" \"shirkers,\" \"usurper,\" \"thief,\" \"burglar,\" and a couple of humorous insults about Gloin's wife and son looking like a man or beast, respectively. One joking insult that seems like a curse word, but is in Dwarf language.\n|Products & Purchases|: There aren't any product placements in the film, but the Tolkien books and Peter Jackson film adaptations have launched a huge amount of merchandise: clothes, video games, LEGO toys and board games, role-playing games, special movie tie-in editions of the books, electronics accessories, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The dwarves have even bigger appetites than the hobbits. They drink on several occasions. There's a scene at a pub where there's drinking, and another where elves steal wine from the Mirkwood's cellar.

Portraying a teen boys' work-camp could give excuses to broach more lewd subject matter, but this movie portrays the rough and tumble without devolving into a gross-out fest. There are some moments of racial and gender tension played out in glimpses of the past (reference to a lynching, men trying to force their attentions on a woman), which might be too intense for younger viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: Stanley and Zero are treated badly by adults at the camp who call them worthless and stupid. Stanley, however, takes on the task of teaching Zero how to read. He sticks out his neck for Zero and eventually saves his life.\n|Positive Role Models|: The adults in charge of the boy's camp are mean-spirited and demeaning. But the adults in Stanley's life are kind-hearted and generous. Stanley has inherited these traits from his family, welcoming Zero into his home like a brother.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Stanley is sent to a boys' work camp, where there is rough-housing and some fist fights. There are wild west flashbacks where a gun-toting female renegade kills men and then kisses their cheeks. Members of the old west community threaten to lynch an African-American man who loves a white woman -- he is shot as he tries to escape. Perilous moments on the face of a rock, as Stanley and Zero nearly fall to their deaths. A character commits suicide by allowing a poisonous lizard to bite her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Non-sexual scenes of boys showering (in their underwear).

This skillfully animated movie creates a believable world in which aliens known as The Boov, running from their enemies, must find a new planet to inhabit ... so they take over Earth. Human families get broken up in the forced relocations that follow, and Tip (voiced by Rihanna) is separated from her mother -- which could be upsetting for small children. She teams up with Oh (Jim Parsons), the most human-friendly of The Boov, and an adventure ensues. The invaders and their large ships could be a little scary, and at one point it looks as though a main character dies (though that's not the case). There's also a little bit of toilet humor, but not much in the way of strong language, inappropriately sexy stuff, or substance use.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, rather than educate, but there are some lessons about the power of friendship and tolerance.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of tolerance, the power of friendship, and being who you really are. The Boov (and all viewers with pessimistic leanings) are encouraged to embrace humans' irrational but endearing tendencies toward hope and perseverance. Boovs give up when the odds are against them, but Tip never gives up on finding her mother.\n|Positive Role Models|: Oh feels like an outsider among his people because, like humans, he wants friends and social interaction (in general, the Boov prefer to be alone). Despite their differences, he befriends Tip, and they teach each other the strengths of their people.

The movie has several scenes of drinking and partying, including an adult couple's drunken attempt at sex. There are more sexual situations between the couple, too, but no nudity. Language isn't frequent but includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"goddamn\"; in one scene, a bag of marijuana is discovered (but it's not used on-screen). Given the movie's premise, it's no surprise that the topic of separation and divorce is central. Witherspoon's character's kids catch her emerging from her room one morning with one of the younger guys. Parents will want to gauge how ready kids are to talk about moving on from a failed marriage into a new concept of family.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages aren't especially clear, but you could argue for takeaways related to the value of the family we choose rather than the one we're born into. The movie also embraces unconventional but loving relationships.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most characters are so wrapped up in their own wants that they fail to see issues from others' perspective. While they eventually come around, it's not particularly convincing or natural. At least the adults all care about the kids. Despite the fact that it's set in Los Angeles, the movie's characters and cast aren't notably diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Brawl between two people who don't know how to fight.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No nudity, but several scenes of a couple in bed -- one in which they try but fail to have sex (played for comic effect), one in which they succeed, and several snippets as part of a montage.

What might be shocking to parents who haven't seen this movie since it first came out is the level of disrespect between kids and adults and the amount of sibling name-calling early in the movie. Adults speak of \"nude beaches,\" and young Kevin is called a \"disease\" and \"puke\" by his older siblings and even a \"little jerk\" by his uncle. On his end, Kevin has absolutely no problem talking back to his mother. The parents themselves don't exactly emerge as positive role models, but then again, if they had been more mindful, the entire premise of the movie would be shot. There's a tremendous amount of slapstick violence in this movie, some of which results in very painful-looking injuries. The main character inflicts serious pain on two would-be burglars -- he trips them down a flight of stairs, burns them, hits them with heavy objects, places sharp objects on the ground for them to step on, and so on. Kevin also is shown watching a violent gangster movie that his parents have forbidden him from seeing. He finds an issue of Playboy in a secret stash in his older brother's room but doesn't express much interest in it. Profanity includes \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"s--t.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of the film include courage and perseverance, as well as f mending family rifts and finding holiday cheer in unexpected ways. However, parents should also be warned that it suggests that a child who's left alone can fend for him or herself without adult supervision. It also celebrates violence as a means of solving problems.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kevin is brave and resourceful, and demonstrates courage and perseverance. However, he's also pretty vicious in his attacks on the bad guys. There are also iffy role models in the other adult characters. The fact that his parents leave him behind doesn't speak highly of their status as role models, and the two would-be burglars are clearly iffy. Overwhelmed adults and bratty kids are painted in a harsh light -- the name-calling and arguing is nonstop, and a young boy has no problem talking back to his mother.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent slapstick violence, especially toward the end. Characters fall down stairs, get hit with blunt objects, step on nails and glass, get burned. The lead character shoots one of the thieves trying to break into his house in the groin area with a BB gun.

A couple (Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney) are trying to retrieve a valuable doll they believe is inside the home of a young boy named Max (Archie Yates), who thinks the pair want to kidnap him because his vacationing family accidentally left him behind. To fend them off, Max sets up a series of traps that involve heavy flying objects, fires, explosions, and pushpin-bearing darts. The two adults slip repeatedly on ice, sink into a covered pool, fall off a stone wall, walk on Lego bricks, run into things, are nearly impaled by falling objects, drive their car into a pole, and lose a tooth. The beatings are played for laughs, but the motivation for the couple's desperation is financial hardship due to unemployment, and their economic problems are contrasted against other people's wealth in the film. Both they and Max ultimately learn that family is more important than possessions or places and that home is just another word for family. Secondary characters are Black and Asian.

One character complains her family makes her \"anxious, furious, and insane,\" but she has to spend Christmas with them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pam and Jeff are loving parents and kind people who are pushed to the edge of reason by their financial circumstances. Max defends himself with violence, but really he's just a kid who misses his parents.\n|Diverse Representations|: Characters are White, Asian, and Black. A boy teases a man about playing with dolls.

During his leave, Payton helped coach his tween son's underdog football team, which the film portrays as a ragtag team of nice, diverse kids who try hard and always support one another. Even once they start winning, the team doesn't lose sight of more important priorities, teaching Payton lessons in humility and compassion. Expect some strong language, including \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"butthole,\" (which Netflix's English subtitles replaced with \"a--hole\"), \"suck,\" \"heck,\" \"stupid,\" \"crap,\" \"son of a\u2026,\" and \"oh my God.\" A character who's known to have an alcohol dependency is often the butt of jokes.

One man shows another an uncensored picture of his wife giving birth, though the photo isn't seen on screen. A middle school boy has a crush on a girl; he serenades her, and later she blows him a kiss.

Adults can learn positive life lessons from kids. There's a stereotypical portrayal of a hippie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Middle school boys support each other, demonstrating teamwork on and off the football field. Coach Payton (who's a complicated role model in real life, given his alleged involvement with the Saints' bounty scandal) learns humility, to put others (including his estranged son) before himself, and that winning isn't everything. Beth supports her son having a relationship with his absentee dad; her new husband is depicted as a stereotypical New Ager. Parents sometimes live vicariously through their kids.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main character is a White man, but there's racial diversity among teammates and their families.

There's also one use of \"damn\" and a fair bit of \"insult\" language (\"stupid,\" \"doodie,\" \"shut up,\" etc.), and some families may be bothered by the somewhat stereotypical way that an ogre and a giant are portrayed. That said, there are a few positive life lessons about redemption and collaboration, not to mention that most of the best agents are female (like Granny and Red).\n|Educational Value|: The movie intends to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: The two major storylines make the point that being \"number two\" doesn't mean you're a failure unless you yourself believe that, that it's always OK to need help, and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of helping others. But the depiction of the Italian mob boss-like giant and the Eddie Murphy-imitating ogre might disturb some audience members.

There are \"jokes\" about anorexia, pedophile priests, erections, cross-dressing boys, homosexuality, and race. Potential messages about acceptance and maturation are forsaken for cheap and easy attempts at humor. Teens drink in a dance club, and later, drink at a strip club. In the dialogue, there is strong sexual content, as parents openly discuss their sex lives, and in one scene, a mother makes sexual advances on a \"Mexican gardener\" who is actually her daughter. The content oftentimes feels more R-rated than PG-13; but even for older teens, there isn't anything of merit in this pointlessly crass and tritely formulaic attempt at \"comedy.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Any potential for positive messages in this movie are avoided in favor of crass humor often at the expense of those who are \"different.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: High school stereotypes abound in this film, as do race and gender stereotypes. While there are plenty of opportunities to show Jessica learning from the mistakes of her snobbish and cruel behavior to those around her, that message is drowned out by the obnoxious humor pervading every scene of this movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comic violence. A janitor in a mall drives into a post with his vehicle while distractedly staring at a pretty teenage girl on an escalator. Security guards in a mall tackle a teenage girl after she sets off a security alarm. A man falls down metal bleachers after being pepper sprayed in the face by a teenage girl; he is shown falling on his face. A girl who has transformed into a man gets into a pillow fight with her best friends; with her newfound strength, the force of her pillow swings sends her friends airborne and crashing into walls, knocking them out. Characters get into a bar fight, culminating in kicks to the shins and groin.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Early in the film, characters use their sexuality to take advantage of people and situations. When a cheerleader becomes a thirty-year-old man, her best friend demands to see \"her\" penis. When the cheerleader calls her boyfriend and sounds like a man and says she regrets not being more affectionate, her boyfriend thinks it's a priest calling. While posing as a male Mexican gardener, the cheerleader listens as her father tells her about his sex life; later, the cheerleader's mother makes a pass at \"her.\" A father is shown in bed reading Playboy magazine, then tilting the magazine sideways to look at the centerfold.\n|Language|: Frequent profanity. \"Ass.\" \"Asshole.\" \"B---h.\" \"Dicking around.\" The word \"gay\" is frequently thrown around in a negative connotation. Characters call each other \"sluts\" and \"skank hos.\" Towards the end of the film, a Korean mother, dressed in the manner of a hip hop performer, says to her half-Korean, half-African American daughter, \"N----r please.\" A father, to who he believes is his Mexican gardener, lowers his pants to reveal his \"pornstar trim.\" Early in the film, a teen girl insults another teen girl by making an anorexia joke. Jokes and sight gags regarding periods, and male urination. A man's rear end is shown twice.\n|Products & Purchases|: After transforming into a thirty-year-old man, a cheerleader is shown using several bottles of clearly-marked Secret Deodorant.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: At the beginning of the film, and appearing intermittently for the rest, the SNL sketch with the punch line \"you can put your weed in it\" is brought back to life. Teens drink at a dance club, and are later shown drinking at a strip club. A agitated mother puts whiskey in her coffee, and later abuses prescription drugs. The lead character orders several drinks at a dance club. A thirty-year-old man who has switched into a teenage girl's body lights a cigarette and starts to smoke before the cigarette is yanked from her mouth.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682e5af944001f1f857a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hot-fuzz", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that what at first seems like a British parody of American cop flicks turns into a much bloodier (and funnier) homage to blow-'em-up blockbusters. The gun play and cartoonishly graphic violence rivals that of any Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer production, but at least the bulk of the gore is confined to the last third of the film. Like Shaun of the Dead, which was made by the same director and stars, this movie is full of colorful foul language, but it doesn't have the raunchy nastiness of similar movies.

The only potentially frightening elements are Dracula's \"angry face,\" which he flashes when he can't control his rage (it only lasts a few seconds, but it's a bit demonic looking), and a mob scene that puts a central character in danger. There's also a backstory that involves humans killing the main character's mother, but it's handled delicately. Language includes insults/rude words like \"stupid\" and \"shut up,\" and there's some innuendo, flirting, and a quick kiss between a 118-year-old vampire hybrid and a 21-year-old guy (hey, it worked in Twilight!).\n|Educational Value|: Kids just being introduced to \"horror\" movies will meet some iconic genre characters.\n|Positive Messages|: Sweet messages about a father's love for his daughter and his promise to her (and his deceased wife) that he'll keep her safe at all costs. The idea that parents need to eventually step back and let their kids grow up, take risks, and find adventure is the main theme of the story.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jonathan is an adventurous spirit who learns to see beyond the monsters' freaky/creepy exteriors and discover that they're pretty cool. He encourages Mavis to travel and find her own way in the world. The monsters -- with the exception of Dracula -- can see that Jonathan's a great guy. Mavis, despite being holed up at the hotel, is a well-loved daughter and \"niece\" to all of her parents' dearest associates. Dracula is a protective, loving father who just wants to keep Mavis safe.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dracula has a frightening face that he flashes whenever he can't control his anger. It's definitely the scariest thing in the movie except for the mob scene when the zombies dressed as humans try to torch Mavis. Instead, they catch fire, but the audience knows it's not really humans. The monsters at the hotel aren't really scary. There is a flashback to when humans attacked Dracula and his wife, which resulted in her death. The mother's absence is mentioned frequently, but handled delicately.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of googly eyes and flirtation between Mavis and Jonathan, who eventually kiss. Some mild innuendo.\n|Language|: Insults like \"idiot,\" \"shut up,\" \"jerk,\" \"stupid,\" plus scatological jokes about all of the \"poop\"/\"waste\"/\"filth\" that Wanda and Wayne's werewolf kids make.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the movie, but there are real-life promotional/product tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769d47a53e9001e6f1b8e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hotel-transylvania-2", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Hotel Transylvania 2 is the sequel to the popular (if not particularly critically successful) monster comedy Hotel Transylvania and once again features the voices of Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, and Selena Gomez. Except for a few blink-and-you'll-miss-them \"angry faces\" from Dracula and a couple of other vampires (and the monsters' somewhat creepy appearance in general), the one genuinely scary part is when a group of demon bats fights the human-friendly monsters near the end of the movie. Language includes mild insults like \"stupid\" and \"imbecile,\" and the romance is limited to a couple of kisses. Positive messages focus on family unity and diversity, and the characters are all trying hard to do well.\n|Educational Value|: Kids interested in horror movies will be introduced to classic monsters in a harmless way. Kids will also learn the benefits of diversity.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages about the importance of tolerance, fighting prejudice, and celebrating diversity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Drac is a caring, attentive grandfather, even though he puts Dennis in harm's way on his night out. Everyone loves Dennis despite the fact he's half monster, half human. Mavis is a wonderful mother who wants to do what's best for Dennis, even if that means moving away from Transylvania so he can be around more humans. Jonathan is brave, kind, and funny.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A battle late in the movie between demon bats and the monsters is scary. The friends accidentally set a camp on fire with their antics. A car explodes. The monsters try to scare people but fail. It looks like a boy will fall to injury, but his grandfather saves him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mavis and Jonathan kiss at their wedding; later, Jonathan complains about not getting any \"alone\" time with his wife.

There's a bit more scary stuff/violence here than in the previous films; much of it is comic, but there are some tense chases, crashes, and confrontations, a creepy robot/human hybrid, and a long sequence involving an enormous sea monster on a rampage. Expect a few mildly suggestive remarks and moments -- butt jokes, buxom witches chasing after an elderly vampire in a skimpy bathing suit, etc. -- and a few unflattering depictions of female characters, like a beautiful witch on a dating app who turns out to be a warty troll. There's also a fair bit of romance in the movie, but it's limited to flirting, dancing, and a couple of kisses. Positive messages include embracing diversity, letting go of negative feelings and grudges, believing in the power of love, parents and kids communicating with each other, and the importance of parents reconnecting as partners, not just co-parents.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will be introduced to classic monsters in a harmless way. Kids will also learn the benefits of communication, tolerance, diversity, and understanding that it's OK to love someone from a different background.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages include importance of tolerance, letting go of old grudges, being open to new relationships, fighting prejudice, communicating with your family members, parents reconnecting as partners, and celebrating family and friends. \"You have to honor the past, but we make our own future.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Drac is a caring, attentive grandfather, even though he lies about where Dennis is in one scene. He loves his daughter, son-in-law, and friends and would do anything to protect them. He falls for Ericka even though she's human and is willing to overlook her past and ancestry. Ericka learns to look past her family's legacy and decides to see the good in Dracula. There are a couple of slightly insensitive jokes toward women -- for example, on a dating app, Drac matches with a photo of a beautiful witch, only to video chat with her and discover she's a warty old crone. And a trio of randy witches seem to only care about chasing Vlad. Some German stereotyping. Frank appears to be a gambling addict.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Van Helsings go after Dracula and other monsters with weapons (ray guns, etc.) and schemes; an early montage includes fights, chases, crashes, and more -- injuries happen but aren't lingered on. In one sequence, Ericka purposely puts herself in danger to see if Dracula will save her; he does (from booby traps galore). At the beginning of the movie, a monster with spikes nearly impales Mavis, but it's played for laughs. The most frightening scene is when a large, scary Kraken starts to attack all the monsters on Atlantis and nearly kills everyone. A human/robot hybrid can be creepy. A little werewolf bites off Frankenstein's finger. In a comedic sequence, an airline called Gremlin Air features the chaotic monsters nearly injuring everyone on the plane. Underwater volcano. Slapstick falls.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two newly married monsters kiss at their wedding. Jonathan and Mavis cuddle and hold hands. Drac briefly uses a monster version of a Tinder-like app to look for online dates. Three buxom, randy witches stare at Vlad in his (very skimpy) bathing suit and chase/make flirtatious overtures toward him. Drac and Erika dance, flirt, and kiss. Lots of talk about \"zinging\" -- which is monster talk for falling in love at first sight. A few butt-focused jokes/visual gags. A minor character is very voluptuous. References to \"looking hot\" and \"working it.\" Shirtless male waitstaff.\n|Language|: A couple of fart jokes because vampires are \"garlic intolerant.\" Jonathan tells Mavis she did a \"cute toot.\" A suggestive comment or two: \"Would you like to see my parts?\" and \"stitches in all the right places.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera: close-ups of Sony electronics, particularly an Xperia mobile phone. Off camera, the movie series has many tie-in products: apparel, games, figurines, toys, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Champagne, drinks at cruise events.

The story focuses on Johnny (voiced by Andy Samberg), who uses Van Helsing's (Jim Gaffigan) \"Monsterfication Ray\" to turn himself into a monster after Drac (Brian Hull, stepping in for Adam Sandler) lies and tells him that only a monster can inherit the family business. But the device also turns the monsters, including Drac himself, into humans. Expect mild peril (falls from heights, etc.), lots of slapstick physical comedy (mostly at the expense of how frail humans are compared to monsters), property destruction, and a fanged and red-eyed rampaging gerbil monster. There are few laugh-inducing shots of the Invisible Man's bare bum once he becomes visible (one shot is especially large and looming), as well as some affection/kissing between couples, mild insults, and characters drinking a toast during a celebration. \"Humanizing\" the monsters makes it clear that the characters are more diverse as monsters than they are as humans. But as with the previous movies, the story has themes of celebrating differences, accepting others as they are, and the importance of teamwork.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will be introduced to classic monsters (at least before they're transformed) and hear a few words in Spanish.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages include the importance of accepting others for who they are, being empathetic to others' differences, learning how to respect children's relationships, and communicating with friends and family members. There's an overarching theme about not forcing others to change and appreciating what they bring to your life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Drac is, as always, a caring, attentive father, grandfather, and even father-in-law, even though he gets flustered easily and lies about his intentions. Johnny is loving, enthusiastic, and eager to contribute to the family, if a bit over-energetic. Mavis is intelligent, loyal, and brave. She protects and defends her family. Ericka is happy to be part of the Hotel Transylvania family and has given up her monster-hating ways. The friends are all loyal to Drac and one another.\n|Diverse Representations|: The human (or human-looking) characters are predominantly White. A couple of voice actors are Black or Latino. The characters are all different types of monsters (and a human) and live harmoniously with one another. Tolerance and acceptance are major themes of the movie. Female characters have agency, but male characters are in the story's spotlight.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Physical comedy involves lots of slapstick bits with characters falling or getting hurt but not too seriously injured (like big falls and an extended sequence of mosquitoes and piranhas biting a now-human Drac). The Johnny monster gets increasingly more feral and beast-like as the movie develops and loses his human thoughts. All of the characters survive dangerous situations in which it seems they'll be seriously injured, whether from the environment or the transformed monsters -- but all ends well. Destruction of property by various monsters. Potentially scary gerbil monster has fangs and red eyes. Some disagreements.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mavis and Johnny hug, dance, and kiss briefly. Drac and Ericka also flirt and hug. A few butt jokes and shots of a bare butt (one especially large/looming) when formerly invisible Griffin becomes visible. Frank takes selfies of his new hunkified human-looking self, and he's shirtless in one scene.\n|Language|: Mild insults like: \"I'm disgusting,\" \"I'm so human,\" \"No one wants to see you,\" and screaming in horror at a character's new appearance.\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera, just a Sharpie and a quick glance of a phone.

Since main character Shelley is a Playboy bunny, sex in general is a main theme of the movie, even though the only \"action\" is a couple of kisses. There are constant references to Playboy: The mansion, the magazine, and Hugh Hefner himself all play central roles in the plot. Scenes set in the mansion include scads of barely dressed bunnies wearing revealing lingerie or tiny bikinis, and Shelley does the same even after she leaves (in one scene, the entire length of her nude body is visible from the back). Characters also discuss sex and virginity. One sorority sister is pregnant, but her pregnancy is used like a prop instead of taken seriously. Language includes one \"f--k\" and many uses of \"bitch,\" and characters drink frequently (though generally not to excess) at both the mansion and college parties.\n|Positive Messages|: Although the movie's ostensible message is that everyone should just be who they are, young female viewers are much more likely to get the idea that they need to be thin, tan, and dolled up to be sexy and attractive to the opposite sex. While there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice, the Zeta girls go from not caring a fig for how they look to (temporarily) becoming just as judgmental and looks-obsessed as the sorority girls they disliked. Shelley's dream is to be a Playboy centerfold. On the other hand, at least Shelley makes philanthropy cool (even if she can't say the word properly). The Iota Mu sisters are typical movie \"mean girls,\" doing their best to humiliate the Zetas and stand in the way of their success. A girl in a back brace is mocked.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman violently twists the nipples of a man she's angry with (but he actually enjoys it); Shelley gets hurt standing over a steaming manhole cover. Several pratfalls.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: All of the scenes featuring Playboy bunnies show women nearly undressed. Shelley walks around in lingerie, bikinis, or other cleavage-bearing outfits all the time. She disrobes in front of the sorority, and her nude body is visible from the back for a few seconds. As for actual sex, there isn't any, but there are a couple of quick kisses and lots of flirting and conversations about virginity/hooking up (including a symbolic \"sacrifice\" of one of the virginal sorority sisters). One male character is in thrall of a woman who turns him on by twisting his nipples painfully. Star Anna Faris appeared in Playboy (though not fully naked) at the time of the film's premiere.\n|Language|: Mostly the word \"bitch\" and its variations, plus one \"f--kin'\" and body parts like \"nipples,\" \"boobies,\" \"penis,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: The Playboy brand, the Playboy mansion, and Hugh Hefner are featured throughout the film. Also shown are Haagen-Dazs ice cream and the make-up store Sephora.

Expect nonstop strong language, including the \"N\" word, \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"d--k,\" \"retarded,\" and much more. There are also crass jokes and comments about sex/sexual positions and one brief scene of bare breasts during a striptease. Characters talk about pot smoking, and adults drink at a party. Most of the cast from the original returns, with the addition of Katt Williams as a mysterious neighbor.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite iffy content, a message that family should come first, that parents should listen to their children -- and vice versa. Stresses importance of honesty and communication in family relationships.\n|Positive Role Models|: No one is a clear role model, but Lorena is a caring stepmother and wife, Carl does love his family, and Hugo is a helpful neighbor.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters use supernatural weapons (like UV light) to fight and kill various vampires.

Ominous music accompanies the Grinch and his cartoon trouble making in multiple scenes. Jim Carrey, behind a rubbery green face, is the master of cackles and distorted facial expressions. A heroic little girl is in danger more than once. Kids who understand the difference between the real and the fantastical will delight in the chaotic, very funny mayhem. So will grown-ups. There are a few moments of crude humor along the way (i.e., the Grinch sticks his butt out and says, \"Pucker up and kiss it,\" and several males ogle a buxom woman).\n|Educational Value|: Encourages kids to further explore the world of Dr. Seuss and promotes solid values in an engaging way.\n|Positive Messages|: In addition to its message about rejecting the commercialization of Christmas and celebrating love, family, and gratefulness, the film also shows how even the smallest kindness can change the hardest heart. The Grinch's behavior and hatred of Christmas is revealed to be the result of childhood bullying and cruelty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cindy Lou, the very young heroine, is willing to face the hostility of all in Whoville in order to stand up for what is right; she teaches everyone about generosity, kindness, and compassion. Her parents, embarrassed at first, later risk censure to support her. The town mayor is bumbling and wrong-headed.

The Grinch's dog is treated poorly -- slammed into snow drifts and run over by the sleigh. And very young or sensitive children may become a little upset at the Grinch stealing all the Whos' Christmas presents.

There are references to impotence, orgasms, sex between people who do not know each other very well, and the appropriate name to give to genitals. Characters drink and smoke. Drinking to the point of drunkenness is portrayed as a way to handle unhappiness. There is also very strong language for a PG-13, including continuous use through one long scene of the word \"bulls--t\" in a card game. Most important, this is a movie in which the characters lie to each other and manipulate each other and make no effort to tell each other the truth, even after they have become very close.\n|Positive Messages|: Deceptive behavior, and numerous negative female and male stereotypes -- meant for laughs but will be offensive to many.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One punch in the face.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plenty of sex talk and sexual behavior.

The dragons attack the Viking village, causing mass destruction, and in a couple of cases, they cripple characters. There's some mild flirting and two brief kisses between teens, and one bittersweet discussion about a deceased mother (and her armored breast plate, which has been fashioned into two helmets). Younger or more sensitive kids may jump during the dragon-fighting scenes. On a positive note, with a strong female character and an honorable, brainy protagonist, kids will learn the value of cooperation, teamwork, and seeing beyond the surface of a situation.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn a bit about Vikings and mythology.\n|Positive Messages|: Hiccup's actions prove that cooperation and teamwork can be better than competition and animosity. By looking past the superficial, Hiccup discovered that the dragons weren't the blind, ruthless killers his people thought they were, and that training a dragon had far more benefits than killing a dragon. Another important message is that the love between a parent and child is unconditional and not based on whether the child is following in the parent's footsteps. There's also the message that girls and women (the Vikings are surprisingly pro-girl-power) can be tough and fearless too, and that brains can be just as powerful as brawn.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hiccup may not look as tough as other Vikings his age, but he's smart and courageous and caring. His eventual popularity and his sacrifice to save his fellow Vikings demonstrate that just because someone looks like a \"wimp\" doesn't mean much. Astrid is a positive role model for girls. Yes, she's beautiful, but it's not her looks that make her notable. She's tough, hard-working, fearless, and loyal. Characters also demonstrate integrity and perseverance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some of the dragons -- particularly in the opening and climactic sequences, along with the dragon training scenes --  are scary looking and cause a lot of destruction. The dragons have burned down homes, killed random characters and maimed a couple of central characters. The huge \"queen dragon\" is big and imposing and is just as likely to swallow a smaller dragon as she is to crush humans in her way.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild flirting and two brief kisses between Astrid and Hiccup.\n|Language|: Exclamations like \"Thor almighty!\" and \"By Odin it was rough\" that substitute the word God for the names of  Norse gods. Some mild taunts and insults like \"coward\" and \"useless\" and one joke about a \"breast hat\" (a Viking hat formed from a breast plate).

Like its big-screen predecessor, this is an epic 3-D adventure with dazzling visuals and gripping action sequences that will appeal to even older kids and teens. Very young fans may be upset by a significant character's death, the alpha-possession of the Berk dragons, the battles between the different groups of dragons, and several close calls for the story's protagonists. Expect more romance in this installment; it takes place five years after the first movie, which means the previously young-teen characters are now all around the marriageable age of 20 -- so it's no surprise there are a few suggestive jokes, especially with the addition of a hunky rogue. But thanks to its strong female characters, touching parent-child relationships, and positive messages about the bond between people and their animal companions, this is must-see for fans of the original and the show.\n|Educational Value|: The movie promotes the idea of diplomacy rather than war and of overcoming self doubt to rise to occasions.\n|Positive Messages|: Hiccup's actions prove that cooperation, diplomacy, and teamwork are better than animosity and war. The love and trust between Hiccup and Toothless is just as important as the love and trust between a parent and child. As in the first movie, there's also a strong message that girls and women like Valka, Astrid, and Ruffnut can be tough and fearless too. Even if they're in love, they don't need men to rescue them and are just as willing to help protect their people and dragons as the male Vikings. Additional themes include integrity and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hiccup may not look as tough as other Vikings, but he's earned the respect of his chief/father and the citizens of Berk by being courageous, intelligent, and kind. He has leadership qualities, even if he doesn't show them at first. Astrid is a positive role model for girls: She's beautiful but tough and doesn't need to be saved. She challenges Hiccup, and they have a romantic relationship based on respect, not just attraction. Chief Stoick has mellowed out a lot since the first film, and he listens and is open minded this time around, even forgiving a long-held resentment. Hiccup's mother asks for forgiveness and wants to be a family again. Unfortunately, the villain is the only non-white character, though his ethnicity is ambiguous.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A major character dies by a dragon who's possessed by an evil alpha dragon. Although the Berk dragons are more like protectors and companions, the other dragons are still capable of harm, in particular the \"dragon army\" led by Drago Bludvist. The battle sequences between the \"free\" dragons and the dragon army may frighten younger viewers, especially when even Toothless turns while controlled by the alpha. A Viking funeral pyre is emotional to witness.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Now 20 and engaged, Hiccup and Astrid kiss and hug a few times. Both Fishlegs and Snotlout compete to pursue and prove with their worth to Ruffnut, who in turn has eyes only for Eret. Ruffnut makes comments about Eret's body and says suggestive things like \"me likey\" when she sees his biceps flexing or \"take me\" when she thinks he might capture her. There are close-ups of Eret's muscles as Ruffnut dazedly gazes at him. There's an emotional marital reunion and a lingering kiss and dance.\n|Language|: Insults like \"coward,\" \"thief,\" \"moron,\" and \"useless.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: There are plenty of How to Train Your Dragon tie-ins available, from video games and figurines to apparel to McDonald's Happy Meal toys.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769e196b655001fddc73e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/how-to-train-your-dragon-the-hidden-world", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third (and supposedly final) of the popular How to Train Your Dragon movies, which were inspired by Cressida Cowell's books. With themes of taking on grown-up responsibilities, this threequel finds young Viking chief Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his trusty alpha dragon Toothless facing big decisions and going up against dark forces who want to kidnap and enslave dragons. While the violence is bloodless (and occasionally played for laughs), there's plenty of it: Battles pit dragons against humans, humans against humans, and dragons against dragons. Expect suspense and peril; one character presumably falls to his death. Characters also exchange a few insults, possibly drink ale, and flirt and kiss chastely. There are strong messages of teamwork, courage, inclusion, rising above self-doubt, and familial support.\n|Educational Value|: Hiccup and Toothless both learn that leadership requires some growing up, making hard choices for the benefit of those they lead. Hiccup has to overcome self-doubt; Toothless comes to understand he has needs beyond happy friendship/partnership with Hiccup.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages of inclusion, rising above self-doubt, courage, teamwork, familial support. Film is mainly about growing up. That applies to both Hiccup, the human, and Toothless, the dragon.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both human and dragon main characters have to move past their childhoods and bravely take on great responsibility, which they do. Hiccup's mother is supportive, courageous. Fellow warrior/love interest Astrid is practical, powerful. Hiccup has always been a strong example of lead male character who doesn't conform to traditionally masculine characteristics.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of dragon vs. human, human vs. human, and dragon vs. dragon battles. No blood or graphic violence, but suspense and peril: Characters are captured/in danger, the dragons are threatened by a villain. Fire. A character presumably falls to his death.

There's a bit of peril/tension when main characters seem to be in danger or possibly injured. The movie's primary imagery is magical and whimsical, including the rather charming titular castle, which clatters and wheezes, walking on mechanical legs. Compassion emerges as one of the film's major themes.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Strong anti-war message running throughout. Compassion wins over cruelty and selfishness. Being old isn't interpreted as a negative but instead a state where you are wiser, more peaceful. Beauty is initially coveted but ultimately becomes irrelevant.\n|Positive Role Models|: The central female character, Sophie, starts out timid but evolves over the course of the film into a strong, confident, loving person. The fact that she's been transformed into an old woman helps rather than hinders her character's growth. Central male character Howl is kind but struggles with selfishness, which he overcomes.\n|Diverse Representations|: Audiences encounter the magical world through the eyes of Sophie, whose journey as a young woman provides the story with its emotional core. While temporarily transformed into an elderly woman, Sophie learns to speak her mind. Old age is depicted in a positive light, accompanied by acceptance and freedom. The film's pacifist stance and appreciation for the natural world, recurring themes in Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki's work, offer a non-Western perspective.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Explosions and war scenes (no bodies). Some potentially scary blob-men who chase after the main characters. Several moments of peril. One early scene where two soldiers intimidate and ogle the main female character.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Background chatter about romance; some romantic tension between central characters and discussion of being in love.\n|Language|: A few colorful insults.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A character smokes a cigar, which is called a \"pleasure.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d0f7a53e9001e74fc8a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-1996", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1996 Disney animated feature based on the Victor Hugo novel. There's animated violence and pratfalls: Characters fight with swords and knives, and one character is injured after getting hit in the shoulder by an arrow. There is some demonic imagery: orange-flamed backgrounds and fire-eyed panther statues. Frollo is a threatening villain who fights with swords and lusts over main female character Esmeralda; he sings a song of \"burning desire\" about her and asks for her destruction -- or possession. There are some moments of humor that may be inappropriate: The gargoyles, who provide comic relief, make reference to \"cut[ting] the cheese\" while making flatulent noises with their armpits, and a goat belches after eating. Natural deformities are addressed because the main character has a hunchback. Also, since this story does take place in Notre Dame Cathedral, religious symbols, icons, and religious themes abound. Esmeralda fights for justice for her people. She stands up to tyranny and defends outcasts such as Quasimodo and her family of Gypsies. Quasimodo shows kindness and loyalty and is willing to do what it takes to help his friends.\n|Positive Messages|: The idea that it's OK to be different and to stand out from the crowd is discussed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Esmeralda fights for justice for her people.

Quasimodo shows kindness and loyalty and is willing to do what it takes to help his friends.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon violence and pratfalls.

Some demonic imagery, flames, and fire-eyed statues. Some peril: Characters nearly burned at the stake. Physical bullying: Quasimodo gets tomatoes thrown at him by jeering guards and then jeering peasants. A house is set on fire, and the people inside must be rescued.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Esmeralda is dressed in a revealing manner, and she's punished by a man who desires her. Frollo makes reference to having \"impure thoughts\" for Esmeralda and sings about his \"burning desire\" for her. In one scene, Phoebus implies that he's interested in Esmeralda in a sexual manner.\n|Language|: Frollo uses threats. Quasimodo is bullied because of his looks, called \"hideous\" and \"ugly.\" Song lyrics include the word \"hellfire.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Disney spin-off items for sale in stores.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some swilling of grog during Festival of Fools scene.

Developmentally, the 10- to 12-year-olds who've read the book may find the movie's visceral, sometimes bloody teen-on-teen violence upsetting -- especially the brutal scene that opens the Games, in which several teens are slaughtered by their fellow contestants. Even young teens need to be mature enough to deal with the 20+ deaths in The Hunger Games; characters are viciously dispatched with various weapons -- including spears, arrows, and swords -- as well as by having their necks broken, their skulls cracked, and their bodies ravaged by carnivorous and poisonous creatures. Despite the violence (which is, overall, less graphic than the novel's descriptions but is still very intense), the movie explores thought-provoking themes about reality television, totalitarian government, and screen violence as entertainment. And Katniss, the main character, is a strong heroine who's resourceful, selfless, and a true survivor. Her mentor, Haymitch, is initially depicted as a cynical drunk, but he ultimately proves to be a valuable ally.\n|Positive Messages|: Thought-provoking, complex messages. Teamwork and loyalty are valued, but deception and artifice are also rewarded. The will to survive, the fragile relationship between a dictatorial government and its oppressed people, rebellion as a preferred option to obedience, and the distinction between image and reality are all addressed. There are many discussion-worthy themes in the movie, and they touch on everything from the micro/personal to the macro/political. Courage, self-control, and perseverance are all themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Katniss is a strong, resourceful, capable young warrior who looks after those she loves. Her entire journey is based on a selfless decision to take her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games. Despite the horrific circumstances that she and Peeta are forced into, they find a way to stay true to themselves and protect each other (and, in Katniss' case, Rue). Peeta encourages Katniss to not let the Capitol make her a pawn in their game. Gale, Katniss' unconditional friend, promises to provide for her family in her absence. Haymitch is a flawed but ultimately committed mentor to Katniss and Peeta; Cinna offers Katniss sympathy and support.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As in the book, The Hunger Games' central \"pageant\" is a televised battle to the death: 24 children between the ages of 12 and 18 (12 girls, 12 boys) are selected to participate in a bloody reality show-style contest in which there's only one victor. There's a pervasive sense of peril and tension, and once the Games start, there's an immediate bloodbath, with vicious weapon use, a fair amount of blood, and several dead bodies -- though the quick editing means that the most gruesome bits aren't lingered on. The young combatants proceed to die from spears, arrows, knives, deadly insect bites, attack by genetically modified dog-like creatures, and poisonous berries (some deaths occur off camera). A couple of the tributes also have their necks snapped or heads bashed. The Gamemakers purposely devise situations to try and kill off characters, including a scary fire with fireball projectiles; another scene has a large explosion. Katniss is badly burned; Peeta has a nasty knife injury. Earlier in the movie, there are scenes of characters practicing with weapons and demonstrating their deadly skills, as well as gory snippets of footage from earlier Games. Scenes of a riot and subsequent retaliation by government forces.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Peeta reveals that he's had a crush on Katniss since they were kids, and the two kiss a couple of times, one time pretty passionately.\n|Language|: Very infrequent use of words like \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"oh my God\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the film, but the viral marketing and merchandise tie-ins for the movie (and books) include a line of themed nail polish, as well as apparel, jewelry, games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Haymitch is often drunk; he has a drink in his hand for the first half of the movie -- though as he gains focus/motivation, he drinks less. Several dinner and party scenes show adults and teenagers drinking various brightly colored beverages/cocktails.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77690b594b2b001e69b830": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hunger-games-catching-fire", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second installment in the Hunger Games trilogy. Although the book series is extremely popular with tweens and even younger elementary-school readers, the movie may be too dark and violent for even mature tween readers. The violence includes deaths by stabbing, shooting, animal attacks, and poison, as well as torture, threats, and explosions. The language includes \"s--t,\" and one bleeped out use of \"f--k\" and other expletives. There's more romance in Catching Fire as Katniss struggles with her feelings for both Peeta and Gale. Alcohol is present in a few scenes (Katniss takes a drink), and there are references to painkiller addicts. Katniss is a flawed but excellent role model for teen girls, and the movie offers many discussion points about politics, war, feminism, and materialism.\n|Positive Messages|: Many thought-provoking messages and themes about totalitarian government, the importance of symbols to causes and movements, the will to survive versus the courage to sacrifice yourself, the lives of the few versus the greater good for all, and more. Depending on the age of your kid, you can discuss everything from the gluttony of privilege to the seeds of revolution to the need for people to stand up for others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Katniss continues to be brave, selfless, and resourceful; she wants to save Peeta even if it costs her life. Peeta in turn wants to do the same for Katniss; he's kind and giving. Gale is a loving friend who wants to help Katniss recognize her potential as a symbol for the revolution. Haymitch is an alcoholic but looks out for Katniss and Peeta; Cinna offers Katniss sympathy and support. Other allies sacrifice themselves to help Katniss and Peeta. Characters demonstrate perseverance and self-control.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Like the original, Catching Fire contains violence in the Games and out of it, though quick edits avoid the most brutal moments. The Games consist of previous Victors, so the youngest contestants are 17-year-old Katniss and Peeta. Government \"Peacekeepers\" viciously torture Gale, strike Katniss, and kill civilians throughout the Districts (some deaths occur just off camera). A black market is ransacked and Katniss' loved ones are threatened. During the Games, the contestants are stabbed, poisoned, drowned and killed in various ways. Katniss, Finnick, and Peeta are covered in boils after being exposed to a poisonous fog. There are a few moments like when the monkey muttations attack that will make audiences jump in their seats. There are also several scenes of people in the Districts rioting.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: More kisses all around for Katniss, who kisses both Gale and Peeta a few times each -- one scene with Peeta is particularly passionate. As in the book, Johanna Mason strips naked (only her shoulders and others' reactions are visible) in front of Haymitch, Katniss, and Peeta after flirting with Peeta and asking \"What's it like to have everyone in the Capitol want to sleep with you?\"\n|Language|: More language than the original, including \"s--t,\" and bleeped out use of Johanna's \"f--k\" filled tirade on the Caesar Flickerman show.\n|Products & Purchases|: No brands featured in the movie, but the film has merchandise tie-ins including apparel, accessories, nail polish, games, and figurines.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Haymitch is known for drinking excessively and is often shown drinking or with a drink in his hand. Katniss takes a swig after bad news. People drink at Capitol parties, and one Capitol partier offers Peeta a drink that will make him vomit so he can keep eating. The District 6 Tributes are called \"The Morphlings,\" because of their addiction to the narcotic painkiller.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769957a53e9001e6ea3b3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is the penultimate and most political installment to date in the four-part adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling dystopian trilogy. Rather than surviving an ultraviolent reality competition, the storyline (which was divisive among readers) is about starting a revolution and taking down the Capitol. While there's much less hand-to-hand fighting -- and no kids killing kids -- the violence can still be intense and upsetting (Katniss spends a big portion of the film crying), with shots of skeletal remains, dead and severely wounded citizens, the execution of traitors to the Capitol, the bombing of District 13, the burning of a makeshift hospital, and more. Fans of the book may remember that although Katniss is preoccupied with Peeta in the first half of Mockingjay, there's little romance except for a brief kiss with Gale and a reunion kiss between two other characters. Even more than the previous films, Mockingjay is full of compelling talking points about media, war, socialism, tyranny, women's roles, and the idea that people need a symbol, to rally around and have faith in during difficult times.\n|Positive Messages|: Many thought-provoking messages/themes about varying styles of government, the importance of symbols to causes and movements, the role of media in unifying people around a cause, and the way love can cloud all other thoughts except the safety of those you hold most dear. Courage, perseverance, and self-control are themes. May spark conversation on everything from politics to feminism to the use of media and propaganda during times of war.\n|Positive Role Models|: Katniss continues to want to save others, particularly Peeta; she makes sure to negotiate his safety in return for her allegiance to the rebel cause. Peeta wants to help Katniss and goes against Snow's orders to help give her a message. Gale believes in the revolution but is willing to put himself in danger to give Katniss what she wants. Finnick is focused on the love of his life's well being, and Haymitch shows Katniss that their friendship means a great deal to him.\n|Violence & Scariness|: No more Games (which means no kids killing kids), but the violence is still realistic and disturbing: the bones of dead District 12 victims are shown up close; a makeshift hospital burns down; rebel fighters kill armed Peacekeepers and vice versa; dead District 8 residents rot on the floor of a hospital; Peacekeepers execute traitors to the Capitol; the Capitol bombs different Districts. Peeta looks starved and tortured. A character tries to choke Katniss.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Less romance than in previous installments; Katniss kisses Gale once, and Finnick and Annie share a kiss.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the movie, but distributor Lionsgate has partnerships with Doritos, Mazda, and Whole Foods Market\u2019s Whole Planet Foundation, and other companies to sell Hunger Games-themed food, apparel, video games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults consume unspecified drinks at a Capitol event.

Like most final films in a book-based franchise, expect even fans who didn't catch the first Mockingjay to want to see how the filmmakers wrap up the story. Be prepared for intense and upsetting violence revolving around Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and company's revolution against the Capitol, including explosions, shoot-outs, several emotional death scenes, and one extremely tense sequence/jump-scare involving the scary creatures known as Mutts. Amid all the action and violence are a few moments of tenderness and romance, but nothing beyond a couple of sweet kisses. As with the first Mockingjay, this film is also full of potential conversation starters about the role of media during conflict, the role of revolutionaries as symbols (rather than actual people), and how extremes on either side of a political spectrum can be equally dangerous.\n|Positive Messages|: Many thought-provoking messages/themes about politics, the importance that symbols play for causes and movements, the role of media in unifying people around a cause, and the way extreme violence is used by both ends of a political spectrum. Themes also include perseverance and self-control. Could spark conversation on everything from politics to feminism to media -- and, of course, the manner in which books are adapted to the big screen.\n|Positive Role Models|: Katniss continues to act courageously even though she puts her life at risk to accomplish her mission. Her friends and allies rally around her, even though they know they might not survive. She shows Peeta compassion even though he's tried to kill her. Peeta is willing to admit to his shortcomings and ask for help. Gale has Katniss' back, and he isn't afraid to confront her about tough topics.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Just as violent as the previous film, and this time even more of the characters who die are those who mean a great deal to Katniss and the audience (though the camera doesn't linger on them as it did with Rue's death in the first film); characters grieve their deaths. The violence ranges from realistic (people die in explosions and from gunshot wounds) to more grotesque (the \"Mutts\" are scary-looking zombie-type humanoid creatures that basically tear people apart, and others drown in bubbling tar). One very tense jump-scare might leave hearts racing. Peeta has violent outbursts and causes an ally's death. A character asks for a suicide pill, and another is about to use one but is stopped. Characters recall past torture.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses between loving couples, as well some tender moments of one couple hugging and lying in bed together.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the film, but many merchandise tie-ins to the movie franchise: games, apparel, jewelry, stationery, accessories, room decor, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink what looks like wine at a Capitol dinner.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5ec75f7705b5d5004391f170": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/hustle", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Hustle stars Adam Sandler and is set in the world of professional basketball. It has tons of strong language and on- and off-court tussles and taunting, but the main characters are kind, generous, and hardworking. There's diversity in the cast, and men are portrayed as loving fathers and spouses. Characters demonstrate perseverance, pushing through physical, financial, and emotional obstacles to pursue their dreams and goals. Still, expect pushing, fighting, and mean-spirited taunts between players on and off the court, as well as references to drunk driving and an assault charge. Swearing includes constant use of words like \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"suck,\" \"cocky bastard,\" \"whore,\" \"Jesus Christ\" (used as an exclamation), \"t-tties,\" \"balls,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" \"heck,\" and more.\n|Positive Messages|: Never back down or give up trying to achieve your dreams. Hard work and perseverance pay off. Sometimes you have to take a chance. Generosity reaps rewards.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sugerman and Cruz both demonstrate perseverance, pushing through physical, financial, and emotional obstacles to pursue their dreams. Sugerman is very generous with Cruz. Both men's families support their dreams.\n|Diverse Representations|: The sport of professional (and street) basketball is very diverse, and Sugerman scouts talent from around the world. Cruz is from Spain. Sugerman is White; his wife and daughter are Black.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of pushing, fighting, and mean-spirited taunts between players on and off the court. A character has a scar from a drunk-driving accident. Another has an assault charge on his record.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mention of \"t-tties,\" compliments that sound \"dirty,\" mentions of \"whacking off\" and watching pornography.

It feels like the other side of The Wolf of Wall Street, focusing on New York strippers who manipulated and conned their stockbroker clients to the point of outright stealing. Thanks to the presence of aspirational celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Cardi B, Lizzo, and Keke Palmer, stripping comes across as the key to a glamorous life, in which women can get rich quick by using their sexuality as a weapon. Most of the men they scam are shown as sleazy, leering, gross, and corrupt, which suggests justification for the women's behavior. Yes, it's lots of fun and features a notably diverse cast, but it's also very mature: Expect drug and alcohol use/abuse, strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" etc.), and sexual content -- including nudity, pole/lap dancing, prostitution, and more.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a cautionary tale about unexpected predators and the slippery slope of compromising your ethics.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters are a diverse group -- in terms of race, body type, sexual identity, and more -- but strippers aren't typically role models/aspirational figures.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An unconscious, bleeding man is injured off-camera and comically gets re-injured. A couple argues in front of their toddler. Male targets/victims are drugged.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Frequent partial nudity including bare breasts and barely covered backsides. Extensive visual modeling of \"sexy\" behavior, including teaching techniques for pole and lap dancing. Women dance sensually, sometimes undressing each other as they perform for men. A scene shows how a character decides to engage in a sex act for money and feels degraded afterward. Sex toy shown on-screen. Women use their sexuality as bait. Full-frontal male nudity used for humor. References to prostitution.\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"bitch,\" \"c--k,\" \"f--k,\" \"goddamn,\" \"p---y,\" \"d--k,\" \"t--ties,\" \"ass,\" and \"s--t.\" Crass sexual language. The \"N\" word.\n|Products & Purchases|: Money is literally thrown in the air (sometimes by celebrities) and women are showered in it. Materialism is promoted, with characters buying fur coats, fancy cars (Cadillac Escalade is treated as the ideal luxury vehicle), and designer clothes (Gucci, Christian Laboutin, Bebe, Juicy) with their ill-gotten money.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Repeated demonstrations of how to drug a target, as well as cooking methods to create the drugs used. Cocaine use and alcohol are shown as pathways to a good time -- but also as things that cloud good judgment. Champagne flows to celebrate, and wine is sipped to secure friendships.

It's not for kids who get scared, since it gets pretty terrifying, especially when the mutants take their turn onscreen. They jump out of nowhere, and the movie makes the most of that suspense to heighten the audience's response. Overall, the movie is very sobering -- and, unlike many Will Smith thrillers, it's light on the fun. Still, teens will want to see it and will be intrigued by the special effects and the edge-of-your-seat action.\n|Positive Messages|: In the aftermath of a viral apocalypse, society has collapsed. People have become zombie-like mutants that feast on human flesh. The main character is reduced to his base nature, paranoid and on the brink. But he rises to the occasion when the time comes and makes a difficult decision for the good of mankind.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent. The main character totes guns and shoots at marauding, rabid mutants who attack him with the intent to either eat him or kill him -- or both. He also accidentally stabs himself, flashes a gun at a woman and her child, and conducts experiments on feral rats and other creatures. Bridges and buildings explode, cars careen, and a loyal dog becomes collateral damage.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple shares a tender kiss.\n|Language|: Pretty mild; \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"Oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Premium placement for the Mustang GT500, Apple computers, iPod, and a Time magazine cover.

In addition to the movie's action/violence (which includes fights, weapons, and menacing killers), expect some swearing (including \"s--t\" and \"a--hole\"), scenes depicting high-school bullying (taunts, shoves, pranks), implied teen drinking, and a bit of kissing/flirty banter.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie seems to say that you can't avoid your destiny -- and no matter how overwhelming the responsibilities of that destiny may be, you can rise to them.\n|Positive Role Models|: John is principled and protective, and Sarah is curious and kind. But other than them, far too many of the characters are one-dimensional -- the bullying jocks, the nerdy sidekick, etc.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action-packed moments, some of which are somewhat bloody and involve intricate weapons that are similar to machine guns and scythes. The killers hot on John's heels appear quite menacing, flashing reptilian teeth and gills. They seem determined to destroy anything and anybody that gets in their way -- for example, one scene shows them about to gore a man with a weapon that looks like a small circular saw, and then he's shown being carried out in a body bag. One haunted house scene depicts teen boys manhandling a teen girl, and a boy who tries to protect her crushes them in an intense fistfight.

A female character swears occasionally: one use of \"f--k,\" along with numerous instances of \"goddammit,\" \"hell,\" and other mild epithets. Starbucks is prominently featured as Sam's workplace, and many other products and retailers are identified.\n|Positive Messages|: Provides a very sympathetic look at the developmentally disabled community and shows elements of both their limitations and strengths. Promotes love, commitment, and good intentions as primary values in parenting and at the same time affirms that \"it takes a village to raise a child.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Insightful portrait of a mentally challenged father. With few resources and against all odds, his courage, industriousness, sensitivity, and unlimited capacity for love help him live well beyond the world's expectations.

The story follows MercyMe singer Bart Millard's turbulent upbringing with an abusive father, as well as how his father's eventual conversion story inspired the breakout hit. There's some heavy material involving Millard's father's emotional and physical abuse, as well as a sad (but expected) death and the exploration of grief and personal faith. Christian families who see the film will likely be familiar with the song and will appreciate the movie's messages of redemption and salvation, as well as its themes of compassion, gratitude, and integrity.\n|Positive Messages|: A story of redemption and transformation through faith, the movie emphasizes the importance of prayer and a relationship with God for believers. Argues that no matter how \"awful\" a person you are, you can still change for the better through faith and God's grace. The power of forgiveness is important to the story, as are honesty and strong friendships. Bart's tale also emphasizes following your dreams and using your gifts. Compassion, gratitude, and integrity are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bart is smart, kind, and talented. He takes care of and forgives his father, despite their troubled history. Bart's father is mean and aggressive but later recognizes the need to ask God for forgiveness. Shannon is patient, honest, and supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A father is abusive to his wife and son. He angrily throws and destroys his own property and hurts his son (he breaks a plate on his head). In one scene, the father and son push each other. A young man is injured in a football game. Loud, scream-filled fights between a mother and father and a father and son.

Renee's newfound confidence allows her to live her best life (i.e., be happy and go after what she wants). Expect strong language (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" etc.), some kissing, flirting, and racy conversations, as well as one sex scene with implied nudity (bare shoulders, legs, thighs, silhouettes) and pillow talk. Characters also drink, at least once to excess. Despite some raised eyebrows about the movie's concept/story, its ultimate message is that self-assurance and self-esteem -- not outward appearance -- are what's important and that everyone is attractive in their own way.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes the idea that no matter how you look or dress, you should have self-esteem and confidence in who you are and in your worthiness as a friend, romantic partner, employee, etc. That said, the message is a little mixed because (spoiler alert!) Renee doesn't realize she still looks the same until the end of the movie. And she truly believes that her boyfriend would leave her because she's convinced that he, too, saw her the way she saw herself.\n|Positive Role Models|: The \"new and improved\" Renee is confident, bold, fearless, and charming. She's not obsessed with her body's flaws (she no longer perceives them as flaws, period), and she's not afraid to go after what she wants. Of course, that only happens when she believes she's beautiful. Ethan is sweet, funny, and loving. Vivian and Jane are good friends to Renee, but they call her out when she starts treating them differently because she believes she's \"hotter\" than they are.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Renee falls off her bicycle during a spin class, and it's obvious she has a head injury. She wakes up confused. In another instance, she falls and hits her head again, resulting in a bloody injury.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There is a sex scene and implied nudity: Viewers see a lot of Renee's silhouette and her skin, like bare shoulders, thighs/legs, and back. Renee does a sexy dance during a bikini contest. There's also post-sex pillow talk; lots of discussion about sexiness, \"hotness,\" relationships, dating, etc., plus scenes of kissing and flirting.

Despite her terminal diagnosis, Jeremy proposes and stands by her side as she fights the illness and their love deepens. If you're in the market for role models, look no further: This couple is as wholesome as they come (the only villain here is cancer). They don't even kiss until they first say \"I love you.\" In fact, their love is so idealistic that the only potential concern is that it might set up unrealistic expectations for kids. While iffy content is minimal and positive faith-based messages/themes abound -- including the value of communication, courage, gratitude, and humility -- the story's focus on sickness, dying, and death could be too much for younger or more sensitive kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of encouraging faith-based messages, with biggest one being that there may be purpose for some pain, suffering, loss. God answers prayers, even if it doesn't always play out as you think.

The results of one car crash are particularly intense. Humans are also in danger: a scientist is dead and bloody on the ground having fallen from a great height; repeated flashbacks show a young girl trapped and drowning in a car; a great, military-like force of robots chase and try to kill humans. Swearing is relatively mild, but there are many instances of  \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"piss,\" etc. In one early scene, Will Smith is seen in the shower, naked from the back, perhaps to compare the human physical ideal with the robotic form, otherwise it seems gratuitous. Product placement is obvious and frequent.\n|Positive Messages|: Human beings have to be watchful as they develop newer and more complex technology; There is a danger inherent in letting automation take over so many aspects of our lives. The hero faces ridicule and punishment for following through on his beliefs; sometimes doing what you think is right has consequences.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroes come in all sizes, shapes, colors, and genders: African-American police officers and supervisors, female scientific expert, etc. Leading character begins as \"robo-phobic,\" but learns to accept, even respect, the robotic beings.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Heavy on violent Robot versus Human action.

It's a dark comedy with plenty of mature content. Harding is serially abused by both her mother and her boyfriend/husband; the scenes of abuse are depicted realistically and have intense emotional impact. There's also pervasive strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more), some sexuality (including strip-club nudity), and both drug use and smoking, sometimes by world-class athletes. Plus, the movie presents a pretty bleak view of the world, in which a person can have everything she's worked for destroyed by idiots and sociopaths.\n|Positive Messages|: You could spin the film's message into something about Harding (according to the film) being a survivor. But, really, it plays out as a series of calamities perpetrated by morons who ruin a person's life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Harding is undoubtedly a survivor. But pretty much every relationship she has in the film is toxic, except for one of her coaches, who tries to help her. None of the other key characters are particularly admirable, either, especially Harding's mother.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Disturbing domestic violence (hitting/beating) that's depicted realistically, with emotional impact. There are several such incidents; Harding is abused by both her mother and, later, her boyfriend/husband. The infamous attack on Nancy Kerrigan is shown in passing. The most graphic violence occurs in boxing matches toward the end, which are pretty vicious and bloody.

A mother drowns while trying to save her infant. Fang-toothed tigers are continually shown in close-up while on the attack. Murderous rhinos chase the earth's most vulnerable beings. Nature's calamities (avalanches, erupting volcanoes) are overpowering and threaten everything in their paths. Animals are depicted as killers simply for the sake of evil, rather than as a means of survival.The human tribes featured are powerless in the face of a dangerous natural world.\n|Positive Messages|: Different species can bond and work together for a righteous cause. Members of a herd, even a herd with diverse species, must save and sacrifice for one another: \u201cthat\u2019s what you do in a herd.\u201d Through example, even a villain can learn respect and empathy for others.

It's not necessary for viewers to have seen all of the former films to understand the plot line, but it does help. The violence/peril is less intense than in previous installments but does feature serious natural catastrophes -- like a fiery asteroid headed for Earth (and destructive meteors) -- as well as egg-stealing birds bent on destruction. You can also expect a little bit of insult language (\"turd,\" \"stupid\"), as well as mildly suggestive comments about \"parts retracting\" and hotness. The coupled-off characters also embrace or kiss very briefly. As always, the messages revolve around teamwork and the unconditional love/acceptance of the right \"herd.\"\n|Educational Value|: Kids might be interested in learning more about prehistoric animals or planetary science. That said, the science (and timelines) in these movies has always been handled in a not-strictly-factual manner, so that's important to keep in mind.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about friendship, teamwork, courage, and what it means to belong to a family/herd. The subplot with Sid reminds audiences that someone should love you for who you are not what you look like, and Peaches' romance is a reminder that it's important to connect with the family of your significant other (and vice versa for parents). Buck's story promotes the idea that it only takes one individual to make a big difference.\n|Positive Role Models|: Buck is brave and helps other unrelated animals. Manny, Diego, and Sid are selfless friends who would do anything to protect one another and the rest of their herd. Peaches stands up to her parents to assert that she loves them but should also be treated as an adult.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A huge meteor shower hurtles toward Earth, destroying parts of it. The main characters must escape several close calls with the burning meteors and incoming asteroid, as well as carnivorous dino birds. Buck uses a giant tooth as a knife and saves an egg from three egg-stealing/eating dinosaurs. Scrat is constantly (and humorously) injured on his quest to get his beloved acorn. In one scene, his skin momentarily falls off his bones because of a gravity shift.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of suggestive double-meaning jokes -- like when a character says \"hot tubbing just got a whole lot hotter\" after another character turns young in a fountain of youth-type of environment. A couple of sloths kiss; coupled wooly mammoths embrace and link snouts. A female sloth asks a male sloth to be her \"mate for life.\"\n|Language|: Insults and potty language like \"duty/doody,\" \"my parts are retracting,\" \"turd,\" \"stupid mammals,\" \"fun-sucker.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although there's no consumerism in the movie, there's tons of Ice Age-related merchandise/marketing: apparel, games, toys, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5fd4f985357c02002d315018": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-ice-age-adventures-of-buck-wild", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, which is part of the popular Ice Age franchise, has frequent animated action involving perilous situations and some mild language. Both returning and new characters, voiced by a diverse cast of actors, grapple with family issues including cohabitating and moving out. Characters discover qualities in themselves that allow them to gain confidence and improve their relationships. The film has messages about existing peacefully alongside those who are different from you and being a contributing member of your \"herd.\" But there's also cartoon mayem: fires, poisonous creatures/plants, avalanches, falls, fights, crashes, lava, rocks, threatening animals, and more. Characters recall other characters from past movies in the series who died or were permanently separated. Language includes \"butt,\" \"geez,\" \"imbecile,\" and \"dimwits,\" and there's some potty humor involving peeing, farting, and other bodily functions.\n|Educational Value|: The film could inspire kids to look up various animal species and learn about their habits, abilities, habitats, and diets.\n|Positive Messages|: Courage and resourcefulness make a hero, not superpowers. Family is who you choose it to be, but family can also be difficult. Even so, you're \"a part\" of a family even when you're \"apart,\" and moving out doesn't mean stopping loving your family. A peaceful and harmonic coexistence on earth is ideal. Change is scary but can be good, and growth is always good.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters make sacrifices for others, including putting themselves in harm's way. Crash and Eddie at first take risks and make impulsive decisions without thinking about how their behavior impacts others. Buck and Zee learn to compromise. Ellie figures out she needs to believe in her adopted brothers and let them make their own mistakes rather than always trying to protect them. Characters accept the idiosyncrasies of others. Orson was bullied as a kid and grows up to be a mean and selfish adult.\n|Diverse Representations|: The voice cast behind the characters is diverse. The film has messages about choosing your family and existing peacefully alongside others who are different from you.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of animated violence and peril involving threats between animals, fires, poisonous creatures and plants, avalanches, falls, fights, crashes, lava, rocks, and more. Crash and Eddie are thrill-seekers who engage in dangerous \"extreme stunts.\" Characters recall other characters from past movies in the series who died or were otherwise permanently separated.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Butt,\" \"geez,\" \"imbecile,\" \"dimwit.\" Some potty humor involves peeing, farting, and other bodily functions.\n|Products & Purchases|: The film could inspire interest in the Ice Age franchise and merchandising.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77689b1999bc0020dcae2c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ice-age-continental-drift", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ice Age: Continental Drift is the fourth installment in Fox's popular prehistoric animal franchise. Even the youngest moviegoers will want to follow Manny, Sid, and Diego's latest adventures. Like Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, this one's in 3-D and features some cartoonish violence, mild romance, a smattering of insults, and some scatological humor. On the plus side, there are a lot of overtly positive messages about family and friendship.\n|Educational Value|: Kids might be inspired to learn about prehistoric animals, but Ice Age: Continental Drift is obviously intended for entertainment purposes and shouldn't be considered an accurate depiction of the way ancient mammals interacted.\n|Positive Messages|: The central idea of every Ice Age film is that your herd (family) isn't necessarily the one you're born with but the tribe that protects you and loves you unconditionally. Even though Sid's sloth family abandons him, Manny and Diego never will. The subplot with Peaches reminds viewers that true friends accept you as you are, not under the condition that you dump another friend first.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main characters are all committed to teamwork and to their herd, even in the direst of circumstances. Sid and Diego never question Manny's determination to get back to Ellie and Peaches. Ellie is a patient and understanding mother. Peaches is a somewhat stereotypical teenager who's embarrassed by her over-protective parents, but she learns how lucky she is by the end of the movie. Ellie's best friend Louis might look like a weakling, but when things get scary, he summons his courage to save Peaches. Even usually senile Grandma knows a lot more than she lets on.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cartoonish violence, as per usual with the Ice Age movies. Scrat unintentionally causes widespread destruction and personal harm in his attempt to secure his precious acorn. Young kids might be scared when Manny, Diego, and Sid are separated from the rest of the herd. The pirate Captain Gutt is menacing and tells a frightening story about how he got his nickname. He's bent on revenge and is willing to sacrifice any of his pirates to achieve it. None of the other characters is really hurt, however, so there isn't a body count or anything too gruesome. Also, the sirens in their original form are quite creepy looking.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Peaches has a crush on Ethan, while her molehog best friend, Louis, is smitten with her. Peaches calls Ethan \"hot.\" Diego and Shira flirt and eventually declare their interest in each other. Sid and Manny poke fun at Diego for not realizing he's falling in love. In one funny sequence, monstrous \"sirens\" appear as the opposite sex to lure Scrat, Manny, Sid, Sid's Granny, Diego, etc. to them. The male sloth (who looks like Fabio in sloth form) makes a suggestive statement to Sid's grandma about the \"wrinklier the fruit, the juicier the fruit.\"\n|Language|: Mild insults include \"idiot,\" \"freaks,\" and \"stupid.\" There's also some scatological humor about puking, farting, burping, etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the movie, but the Ice Age franchise has many merchandise tie-ins off camera, including Happy Meal collectible toys, plush dolls, figurines, games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776831f59e5800218983ce": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the third installment in the Ice Age franchise. It's likely to appeal to kids (even the preschool set) as much as the first two. That said, it's the first one in 3-D, so some scenes --  especially the ones featuring dinosaurs -- may be a bit more intense. There's lots of cartoonish violence, mostly involving Scrat and his new female friend (they also flirt and kiss, which is the extent of the movie's romance). Language is mild, but there's some scatological humor (\"barf\" and \"poop\"), as well as suspense concerning the main characters' ability to get out of harm's way.\n|Educational Value|: The movie may spark a real interest in prehistoric animals, particularly dinosaurs, wooly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and sloths.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie offers a positive message about what it takes to be a \"herd\" or family -- no one gets left behind, new members are welcome, and everyone has a place. Teamwork and courage are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ellie -- a strong female character who knows when to assert herself despite protestations from her male partner and friends that she's not capable of defending herself -- is a lovely role model. Buck, although a loner, sacrifices a future with friends to defend them. A dinosaur and a sloth learn to care for each other, showing that affection doesn't depend on what you look like on the outside.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cartoonish violence -- some humorous (all of the acorn antics with Scrat, the baby T-Rexes swallowing their friends, etc.) and some potentially frightening (various dinosaurs chase the protagonists, threatening to injure them). For the most part, the dinosaurs don't do any damage except to Buck, who lost an eye to Rudy, the meanest, biggest dinosaur in the movie. The audience doesn't actually see Buck lose his eye, but Rudy is a scary-looking dinosaur, and the raptors are intense as well. The characters deal with several close calls.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The male and female Scrat flirt with each other and eventually pair off. Manny and Ellie, now mates, are expecting a baby and are quite sweet to each other, hugging and locking trunks. A couple of jokes involving Sid mistaking an animal's gender -- in one case he tries to \"milk\" an animal that turns out to be male; in another, he thinks a baby mammoth is a boy until Diego points out that \"that's a tail.\"\n|Language|: Mild insults (usually directed at Sid) and some scatological jokes about the dinosaurs (\"poop,\" \"barf,\" etc.).\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682854f42c001f8c2c49": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ice-age-the-meltdown", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Ice Age:The Meltdown is a sequel to Ice Age. Because of global warming, the heroes are in peril from rising waters and they are stalked by somewhat scary-looking underwater creatures. There is comic slapstick violence (the acorn-chasing muskrat is squashed, splatted, attacked by a vulture, etc.), a sad memory of a mother's death, and a flood, and the tiger's fear of water is rendered in a couple of \"nightmare\" images (his point of view underwater, with big music).

The good news is that it's mostly tame and family-friendly, except for a few exclamations like \"crap\" and \"hell\" and some possibly off-putting, over-the-top references/jokes regarding Native Americans and their culture. While Murphy's character starts out primarily interested in furthering his career, he ultimately learns an important lesson about putting his daughter first.\n|Positive Messages|: Putting your family first is really the plot of this film.\n|Positive Role Models|: Evan, a workaholic dad, finally bonds with his daughter and decides to make her the top priority in his life. On the other hand, for most of the movie, he uses her special blanket's magical skills to further his career, even resorting to stealing security blankets to attempt to make his own connection with the princesses.Native American culture is referenced, in many cases for a laugh.

Expect candid discussions about lives lost during war, accompanied by footage showing bombs falling and soldiers firing guns. A boy is also tormented by school bullies. Leading the team of scientists trying to break the Germans' Enigma code is Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a closeted homosexual who ends up being vilified for his sexuality. The subject of is handled fairly delicately and is discussed in mostly oblique ways, though characters do call him slurs, like \"toff.\" Ultimately there are strong themes about the power of persistence and the fact that gender doesn't dictate intelligence or competency.\n|Positive Messages|: Perseverance pays off. Gender doesn't dictate intelligence or competency (the 1940s, specifically the Bletchley Project in England, helped usher in gender equality in the sciences). Empathy is a major theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Turing sticks to his guns and his beliefs despite being told by his superiors that he's wrong. Joan Clarke was ahead of her time in her response to Turing's sexuality and courageous in her approach to work.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Bullies torment a classmate at a boys' school; they trap him under floorboards, tease him in the yard, and shove him around.

The film has language and one sex scene. The girlfriend has survived the same crash with a ruptured heart requiring surgery. She starts to think the boyfriend is trying to communicate with her from beyond, resulting in some scenes that could potentially frighten some viewers as he \"appears\" to her in a variety of ways. Though the film is a romance, there's only one sex scene (bare skin but no privates) and lots of kissing and snuggling. A girl mentions her vagina. The film's main messages are that life is worth living to its fullest, that you have to accept the loss that can come with love, and that it's important to face your \"ghosts\" in order to move past them. Language includes \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"bastards,\" \"damn,\" 'crap,\" \"sucks,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"vagina,\" and \"stupid,\" plus \"Jesus\" and \"God\" used as exclamations.

Her adopted parents try to get her to open up. Kyle is struggling to forgive his parents for giving up on their marriage, but he believes in true love. As teens, the two have passions, hobbies, smarts, and talents, and they don't seem to party or get in trouble.\n|Diverse Representations|: Some diversity in the cast. An older woman can communicate with spirits; most people don't believe this is possible. Two high school boys kiss in a hot tub.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A teen is killed by a car, another is left with a ruptured heart requiring surgery. Their bodies are shown splayed out on the road. The young woman left alive (though there's mention of her dying momentarily) begins sensing that her dead boyfriend is trying to speak to her from the beyond; she's warned that trying to meet him there could result in her getting stuck (and dying). She and her friend conduct a s\u00e9ance. She falls from a height and is struck by shattered glass, winding up in the hospital again.

Characters use some crude language, usually in anger or surprise, including multiple uses of the s-word and hell, and slang for sex and genitals. One character reads aloud from a romance novel (including predictable, here comic, references to heaving breasts and sexual passion); and an episode of Sex and the City on TV refers to sexual activity.

Chu's joyous stage-to-screen adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes' Tony Award-winning Broadway musical about a group of neighbors who live in the same predominantly Latino neighborhood of Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan. Regular Miranda collaborator Anthony Ramos stars as Usnavi, a bodega owner whose shop sells a lottery-winning ticket and who introduces viewers to his friends on the block. The film chronicles the lives of hardworking, striving Latino and Black people and immigrants who dream big, navigating the odds to persevere and build a strong, supportive community. Language isn't frequent but delves into salty territory (\"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" \"skank,\" etc.). There are a couple of romances that include kisses and references to spending the night together, some wink-wink references (\"he's got a big ... taxi!\"), and social drinking by adults (as well as one character who's implied to have an alcohol dependency). A beloved character dies peacefully, and many others mourn the loss. Families who love Hamilton and Miranda's work will want to see his first tribute to the idea that \"immigrants get the job done.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Emphasizes importance of community, teamwork, compassion, empathy, perseverance. Talks about how dreams can be a place or a person and can signify community and success -- whether that success is academic, entrepreneurial, or personal. The musical is staunchly pro-immigration and, like Hamilton, explores how \"immigrants get the job done\" and advocates for why America should be proud of its immigrants.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters share resources and opportunities and help, encourage, and support one another in various practical and emotional ways. People make mistakes, but they learn from them.\n|Diverse Representations|: The cast is filled with Latino characters who have come to live in America from various places: Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, etc. But movie has faced criticism around colorism given its lack of Afro-Latino characters in setting of Washington Heights, which has a large Afro-Dominican population. Celebrates working-class individuals, immigrants, community elders. Women have backstories but are seen through a male lens, with Vanessa in particular pursued by a lovesick Usnavi, whose friends egg him on. A same-sex couple appears in minor, blink-and-you-miss-it scenes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A beloved character dies peacefully; their body is visible but looks as if sleeping.

It has lots of action and violence -- including guns, blood, fighting, car crashes, etc. -- as well as some slightly scary imagery. But it's very light on language (\"goddamn\" and \"a--hole\" are as strong as it gets), sexy stuff, and drinking, so teen fans of star Leonardo DiCaprio should be able to handle it. The movie takes place in several different locations around the world but is noticeably short on diversity on-screen. Crowds in one scene in Kenya are simply used as the backdrop to action sequences. It's not an easy story to explain, but it's fairly easy to follow, and it includes positive examples of teamwork and sacrifice. Parents and teens may find themselves talking at length about the story and the notion of a dream within a dream.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the intense scenes and images, the movie offers positive examples of teamwork and helping others. A subplot involving death and grieving  promotes acceptance and moving on. A more ambiguous message is sent by the main story, in which the characters try to plant an idea in someone's head against his will -- but manage to bring him a kind of peace in the process.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character acts for personal reasons -- to earn the ability to return home to his kids -- and has a job that's slightly on the shady side.

While part of the film takes place in Mombasa, Kenya, local residents are depicted as faceless or as an angry mob.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Though most violence takes place in dreams and is therefore not \"real,\" it includes guns and shooting, gunshot wounds with blood, fistfights, rioting, explosions, car chases, car crashes. Characters scream in pain when shot or stabbed. In the movie, being \"killed\" or committing suicide can \"wake\" you out of the dream. One character is shot in the head, another is stabbed, another plunges off a building to her death. Frequent suspense/tense scenes. Repeated scenes of a father reaching out for his children who are being separated from him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character pines for his dead wife, whom he still sees in his dreams. They share some intimate emotional moments, but there's no kissing, nudity, or sex. Two other characters share a brief kiss.\n|Language|: A few uses of \"goddamn it\" and \"Jesus Christ,\" as well as \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bloody,\" \"bastard,\" \"screw,\" and \"damn.\" Partial use of \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters drink wine, beer, and champagne, but not to excess.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769817a53e9001e6e8253": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-incredible-burt-wonderstone", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is heavy on scatological and sex humor, as well as cringe-inducing scenes of some Jackass-style stunts, but it doesn't veer completely into over-the-top raunch. Language includes one use of \"f--k\" and several of \"s--t\" and \"a--hole.\" Main character Burt is known to bed a different woman from the audience every night; two humorous sex scenes feature bra-clad women and jokes about condom size. The violence is mostly self-inflicted by Burt's rival, a street magician who sleeps on burning coals, cuts his skin, asks to be punched, douses himself with pepper spray, and drills a hole in head -- among other things. And early scenes show a kid being bullied. If you dig under the Vegas-style humor, the two big takeaways are that friendship should be forever, and your career should be your passion, not just what you do for money.\n|Positive Messages|: Buried underneath the over-the-top Vegas humor are a couple of positive messages. One is that unconditional friendship should be just that -- unconditional, not based on fame or popularity. The other is that whatever you decide to do with your life should come from a sense of joy and passion, not because of the things it will buy you. Jane's love of magic also shows that women are capable of performing traditionally male-dominated forms of entertainment. And the movie promotes the joy of enjoying the childlike wonder of magic tricks.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jane isn't interested in simply being a magician's assistant; she wants to be a full magician. Rance Holloway explains that being a magician is about providing a sense of awe and wonderment, not going through the motions for a big paycheck. Anton is a great (and in many ways, only) friend to Burt, but Burt is a jerk to him until he realizes the error of his ways.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence is mostly self-inflicted by magician Steve Gray, whose \"street magic\" includes dangerous, don't-try-this-at-home stunts like burning himself with a lighter, forcing someone to punch him in the face, cutting open the swelling from a wound, sleeping on burning coals, and drilling a hole in his skull. An early scene includes a child being bullied and punched. A couple of scenes of animals in peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two comedic sex scenes in which women are shown wearing bras and underwear and making out with Burt in bed. Burt has a tradition of picking a woman out of the audience (based on how attractive she is) to help with a trick and then taking her back to his suite to have sex. Burt brags about his quadruple-king bed which can fit \"at least\" a dozen people. In one of the two sex scenes, Burt and Jane do magic tricks and joke about condoms (she makes a bag of Trojans appear out of nowhere, and he replaces it with Magnum XLs).\n|Language|: One \"f--k,\" as well as several uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"goddamn,\" and the possibly offensive (faux) TV show title Brain Rapist. Other insulting/demeaning language.\n|Products & Purchases|: Many Las Vegas hotels are featured or mentioned, as are Big Lots, Bounty, and Trojan and Magnum XL condoms.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink in a few scenes; in one, Burt gets visibly drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a961905001eb91cff": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-incredible-hulk", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this big-budget comic-book adaptation features extensive, graphic super-heroic violence. There's a strong sci-fi/fantasy element, but unlike the gleaming technological feel of Iron Man, this movie has a much messier, more biological style. Expect plenty of injections and experiments, lots of spilled blood, and more general ickiness than in other superhero movies. The Hulk and his nemesis also look quite monstrous, which might scare the pants off young kids. And there's some language (including \"a--hole\" and \"bitch\") and a semi-clothed kissing scene.\n|Positive Messages|: The military is pursuing Banner/The Hulk in the hopes of recreating his freakish ability as a military weapon.\n|Positive Role Models|: Banner constantly struggles to control his temper for fear of transforming into his brutish, superhuman alter-ego.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extensive super-heroic violence, with super-strong characters striking mighty blows, hurling people and objects about, destroying vehicles, and more. Extensive (albeit mostly pointless) firearms use against the Hulk and his nemesis; explosions, rockets, gas grenades, sonic cannons, and more are also deployed. Wounded bystanders and civilians are seen; the climactic battle features extreme graphic super heroic violence -- for example, the Hulk ripping off one of his opponent's mutated bone-spurs and using it as a dagger. Some martial arts and grappling. Characters fall from great heights; blood is often seen on-screen, as well as painful-looking experimental science-fiction medical procedures.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some kissing in semi-clothed circumstances; some references to how \"excited\" the lead character can get without risking turning into his monstrous alter ego.\n|Language|: Language includes \"crap,\" \"pissed,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"damn,\" and a choked-off \"s--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.

You can expect quite a bit more violence than in many kid-targeted animated movies. There are all sorts of weapons, explosions, deaths, wide-spread destruction, and more. A man tries to kill himself by jumping off a building. Mr. Incredible saves him, but then is taken to court, where they talk about how the man should be allowed to carry out his plan. A few characters are shown with drinks in hand, and one character smokes a long-stemmed cigarette. Despite the intensity of the Bond-level violence, there are plenty of positive themes about family, courage, and identity to make this a must-see for families.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the value of people's different skills and how a family can work together to make a difference, fight injustice, and overcome obstacles.\n|Positive Messages|: The biggest theme is that families that stay together and allow their talents to shine are the strongest. Additional themes include communication and perseverance. Other issues thoughtfully explored through the characters include self-identity, marital restlessness, family dynamics, responsibility to help others, and teen angst.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl show their children that what's most important is for families to stick together, no matter what. Despite their differences of opinion, the Incredibles band together to save each other -- and their city. Characters demonstrate courage and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many, many scenes of intense and sustained, but not bloody, violence. A host of weapons, from handguns to explosives to lasers, are used in various battles between villains and superheroes. Bullets whiz by, cars explode, buildings collapse. Skeletons of killed superheroes are shown, and references are made to superheroes who've died in various ways. Mr. Incredible believes his family has been killed in an explosion, and the family comes near death many times. Hand-to-hand fights are also portrayed, and characters punch and push each other. A man tries to commit suicide by jumping off a building. Mr. Incredible saves him, but then is taken to court where they talk about how the man should be allowed to kill himself. Overall, the body count and general violence is much higher than in most comparable animated adventures.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A long-term couple kisses several times, flirts, pinches each other on the bum, and acts passionately in love. Elastigirl thinks that Mr. Incredible is cheating on her, but he isn't. Teens have a crushes. Mirage's outfits highlight her cleavage. Elastigirl wears a skintight costume. Syndrome makes a racy comment: \"You married Elastigirl and got busy?\"\n|Language|: A few exclamations of \"oh my God!\", \"what the...\", and \"Jeez.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie; tons of licensing/merchandising tie-ins in real life -- toys, games, books, clothes, and much more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters have (or are offered) wine, champagne, and a mimosa.

Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) -- as they again use their powers to rescue the people of their city. From there, the movie explores the Parrs' family dynamics and eventually pits them against a villain named Screenslaver. Like the original, the sequel has frequent, intense superhero action/violence, including large-scale destruction, frequent peril, weapons, and laser beams shooting out of a character's eyes. There's also a scary fight with lots of flashing lights that could be difficult for those with photosensitivity and has prompted some theaters to post warnings due to seizure concerns. Someone is shot in a flashback (the act itself isn't shown, though viewers see the gun pointed at the victim), and there are references to dead parents and several fight sequences that could be too intense for the very young or for those who are sensitive to violence that puts kids or parents in danger. But there's also lots of humor, even in the action sequences, as well as themes of teamwork, courage, communication, and perseverance -- and how easy it is to be manipulated by the screens all around us. Expect a bit of kissing, hugging, and flirting; a little drinking by adults; a character with a long-stemmed cigarette; and some swearing including a use each of \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"crap.\"\n|Educational Value|: As with the first movie, kids will learn the value of people's different strengths and talents and how a family can work together to make a difference, fight injustice, and overcome obstacles. Kids also learn the importance of communicating with their parents and siblings.\n|Positive Messages|: Biggest theme is that families should work together, acknowledge each member's strengths and talents. Teamwork, communication, compassion, perseverance are promoted and exemplified. Other issues thoughtfully explored: self-identity, working mothers, at-home fathers, responsibility to help others, teen vulnerability, parent-child and sibling relationships. Marital dynamics also a theme. Another thought-provoking theme: people's complacency to what they see on screens and how easy it is to be manipulated by screens.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl show their children that what's most important is for families to stick together, no matter what. Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible also demonstrate that every family is different; in some families, it's the mom who works outside the home and the dad who stays home to be the primary caretaker. Violet and Dash prove themselves worthy and mature enough to help their parents on missions. Despite their differences of opinion, the Incredibles band together to save each other -- and their city. Characters demonstrate courage and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many scenes of fairly intense, high-stakes violence, including threats to the city; superheroes cause some of their own destruction to rescue people. Frequent peril; children/parents in danger. Villain Screenslaver manipulates, controls others by hypnotizing them, either remotely or face to face. The supers must use their powers to attempt to save one another -- and regular citizens -- from Screenslaver-planned violence. Some weapons use, including a super-sized jackhammer. One intense/scary fight involves a lot of flashing lights, which could bother photosensitive people and has led to some seizure concerns. Baby Jack-Jack has hilarious but prolonged fight with a raccoon; Jack-Jack's powers include temporarily cloning himself, lighting himself on fire, shooting laser beams out of his eyes, spewing toxic reflux, and turning into a demon. A potentially upsetting story flashes back to how, in the middle of an armed robbery, a husband/father tried to call superheroes, but they didn't take the call, and the robbers shot him (viewers see the lead up but not the act itself).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple kisses and hugs a couple of times. Teens flirt and have crushes. Elastigirl wears a skintight costume.\n|Language|: A use of \"crap,\" \"hell,\" and \"damned,\" plus rude language like \"boys are jerks,\" \"superheroes suck,\" \"superfreak,\" and \"what the....\" A couple uses of \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film itself, but a lot of Incredibles merchandise off camera: apparel, toys, video games, figurines, accessories, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters make a toast/have cocktails at a gathering, and a wide shot of people at a restaurant who may or may not be drinking. Evelyn offers Elastigirl a cocktail (while having her own), and makes a joke about drinking on the job. Edna is shown briefly with her signature long-stemmed cigarette.

The filmmakers take pains to introduce some very likeable characters, only to explode them soon afterward. This movie was the gold standard of sci-fi effects and air battles when it was released in 1996, and older kids and teens that have a firm understanding of the difference between fantasy and reality will enjoy the ride. There's some swearing (i.e. \"hell,\" \"schmuck,\" \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"bastard,\" \"goddamn\"), and one scene takes place in a strip club with scanty costumes. A man who claims to have been abducted by aliens is teased with comments like \"Did they do any sexual things?\" There's an unmarried couple in bed; teens talk about virginity.\n|Positive Messages|: It's clearly stated that the people of Earth, divided into nations, religions, etc., have the ability to put away their differences and unite for their common interests. In this case, all the leaders of the world come together to fight for the right of the planet to exist. Also promotes teamwork and self-sacrifice for the greater good.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroes come in all shapes and sizes -- lots of ethnic, cultural, and age diversity. The government, the military, and individuals put their lives on the line to save the Earth. That said, with one exception (a brave mother saving her child and her dog), the female characters serve basically as emotional support for the male leads. And two very stereotypical Jewish men hover around the plot, mostly for comic relief.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Buildings, major landmarks, and citizens are destroyed by fireballs; cars careen through the air; airplanes explode; spacecraft, both large and small, wreak jet-ray havoc on the hapless Earth. Then, the aliens appear: tentacled, huge, slimy, and powerful. Scientists perform an autopsy on one that morphs into an even more grotesque creature. There are multiple aerial firefights, one-on-one serpent attacks, and an alien-speaking-through-a-human moment that's truly spooky.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A stripper passes some dancers onstage, then finds some strippers backstage in very little clothing. A man who claims to have been abducted by aliens is teased with comments like \"Did they do any sexual things?\" Unmarried couple shown in bed; teens talk about virginity.\n|Language|: Language includes \"hell,\" \"butt,\" \"s--t and bulls--t,\" \"ass,\" \"son-of-a-bitch,\" \"bastards,\" \"goddamn, \"schmuck,\" \"Jesus,\" \"Holy God,\" \"booty.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Coors, Arrowhead water, Minute Maid, Wells Fargo bank, IMB, Reebok, HBO, and heavy on the Coca-Cola.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One character, a father of young kids, is a slurring, self-pitying drunk through most of the film, constantly swigging from a bottle.

There's a supernatural and extra-terrestrial undercurrent and lots of punch-heavy good-guy-versus-bad-guy fights, which do have some blood (as well as plenty of weapons, including swords and guns). There's also a bit of light swearing (\"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" etc.) and innuendo, and enemies routinely hurl unpleasant threats at each other. But it's all handed with roguish, acerbic Indy wit, which makes it -- for the most part -- all in good, popcorn movie fun.\n|Positive Messages|: Although there's plenty of havoc (and even some double-crosses that endanger Indy), it all appears to be for the greater good.

Minor characters are killed in various ways -- gunfire, falls, crashes, etc. One group goes out in flames when a powerful rocket ignites.

Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound.

Told primarily from the perspective of the feelings inside 11-year-old Riley's mind (brought to life by the voices of Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, and more), the plot has many moments of peril/tension -- including bridges/islands crumbling, a train tumbling over a precipice, and characters falling into a deep, dark pit. (Spoiler alert: One key character also permanently fades from existence; that and scenes in which it seems Riley is \"borrowing\" her mom's credit card and running away are definitely upsetting.) Some of Riley's fears are also on display, including a giant, scary clown. Parents are likely to get hit hardest by the film's heart-tugging moments (bring tissues!), but anyone with empathy will feel for Riley as she experiences life's ups and downs. Ultimately, Inside Out has important messages about needing to feel -- and express -- all of your emotions, whether happy or sad. Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters' emotions are shown.\n|Educational Value|: Not at all biologically accurate in terms of how memory and emotions work, but kids will learn a bit about the different parts of the memory/mind (subconscious, long-term memory, abstract thought, etc.), as well as important lessons about empathy and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: We all have many emotions, and they're all an essential part of life. You can't fully appreciate joy without knowing sadness. Kids and parents should communicate honestly and openly to each other about how they're feeling, even when it's hard. Family and friendship help make us who we are. Don't try to be something you're not; love and accept who you are. Teamwork and imagination can solve the most difficult problems. Running away doesn't solve anything. Additional themes include compassion, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Joy is determined, positive, helpful, and focused. She puts Riley's happiness above all else, sometimes to the point of being too controlling -- but she learns to appreciate others' roles. Sadness is quick to put herself down (partly because of how Joy treats her), but she eventually sees that she matters, too. Riley tries hard to please her parents and starts out eager and optimistic; when she later feels angry and lonely, she makes some poor decisions (spoiler alert: she decides to run away, \"borrowing\" her mom's credit card to do so), but she realizes her mistakes. Characters learn and demonstrate self-control, integrity, and empathy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many of Riley's fears are mentioned/shown, including a dead mouse, earthquakes, and an enormous clown. Some tension/peril when Joy and Sadness are sucked into the memory core and journey back to HQ (bridges/islands crumble, a train tumbles over a precipice, characters fall deep down into Riley's memory dump, the subconscious is dark and scary, etc.). Riley cries in class. Riley's parents bicker due to stress; Riley yells at them. Anger's head bursts into flames when he's really upset. Spoiler alert: A key character ceases to exist; he doesn't die so much as fade away, but it's clear he's permanently gone. Kids may be upset when it seems Riley is running away.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Riley's mom recalls a suave, handsome former boyfriend. Riley's mind includes an imaginary boyfriend who says he'd die for her.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of insult words like \"shut up,\" \"moron,\" \"barf,\" and \"dumb.\" Anger makes references to knowing a curse word; there's one bleeped moment where it's implied he finally said it.\n|Products & Purchases|: No actual products within the film, but tons of off-line marketing/licensing tie-ins, from books and apps to a wide variety of toys, clothes, home decor, and much more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768883ab0e7001f503bc5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/insidious", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Insidious is one of the most terrifying scary horror movies in some time, and it's not recommended for younger teens (or anyone without a high tolerance for \"jump\" scenes). There's some blood, as well as some arguing and yelling, and a young boy is in jeopardy throughout the movie (he's separated from his parents, which may add to the anxiety for some kids -- even teens). But most of the horror is in the form of the stuff that nightmares are made of: darkness, shadows, and noises. It's very scary. Language is fairly light but does include one use of \"f--k\"; there's no sex, drugs, or drinking content of note.\n|Positive Messages|: There's a fair bit of conflict -- characters argue a great deal and are unable to agree on much. The wife wants a supernatural solution, and the more practical husband won't allow it. The problem is solved, but not entirely solved.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though these people are all nice enough, they're not much in the way of role models. The wife spends the film being scared, and the husband is vain and argues and hides from his responsibilities for much of the movie. Though he eventually shows bravery, it may be too late.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie isn't violent in a gory way, though viewers do see some bloody handprints and some intense fighting; there are loud, scary noises on the soundtrack; and a young boy is in jeopardy throughout. But while it isn't graphic, the movie is very frightening, with lots of creepy, half-glimpsed figures and a scary alternate universe in which everything is dark and anything could be hiding anywhere.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Language isn't constant but includes one \"f--k,\" plus \"hell,\" \"bitch,\" \"oh my God,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"whore.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: One main character uses an Apple laptop.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768ee51dd69001fe129a6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/insidious-chapter-2", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Insidious: Chapter 2 is the sequel to 2011's terrifying horror hit Insidious, featuring many of the same characters in similar situations. Like the original, there's little or no gore, sex, or language (a couple of uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" etc.), but you can definitely expect a lot of very scary, disturbing, and shocking imagery, as well as some fighting (characters bash each other with household objects). The main young boy isn't separated from his parents in this film, but he is shown to be in danger. Bottom line? If you're not a veteran horror fan, this is the stuff nightmares are made of.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters try to help one another in this movie, even entering into frightening and potentially dangerous situations in order to do so.\n|Positive Role Models|: The supporting characters -- the paranormal investigators -- are the ones who seem the most heroic and interesting. They're forever forging ahead into frightening and unknown situations in the quest for knowledge and also to help others. They're sympathetic, brave, and supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie is filled with very scary images and sounds. Some of the sudden shocks will send sensitive viewers jumping out of their seats. Some disturbing images come up as well, as when the father is seen attacking his wife and attempting to attack his children. In these scenes, characters hurl household objects at one another and beat each other up. Ghosts attack a young boy. Characters use a Taser gun and a syringe full of sedative.

There's tons of spooky stuff -- mainly well-timed jump-scares, plus images of a scary demon attacking a teen girl and a psychic fighting with the same demon. The teen girl is hit by a car and roughed up quite a bit while wearing casts on both legs. Knives are wielded, but only a little blood is shown. Infrequent language includes one use of \"f--king,\" one \"bitch,\" and a few uses of \"ass,\" plus a middle finger gesture. A teen boy has a crush on the teen heroine, but nothing comes of it. There's a joke about two teen girls being lesbians. Like most horror sequels, it's not as good as the original, but it provides enough tingles that it should be a fairly sizable draw for teen horror hounds.\n|Positive Messages|: Family members stick together, helping one another out in a time of need. Other characters put themselves at personal risk to help strangers.\n|Positive Role Models|: After three movies, Elise Rainier is becoming a decent heroine; she's sometimes afraid, and she can seem frail, but she's also strong-willed and clever and refuses to give up.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of scary stuff, mostly jump-shocks with screaming demons. A girl is hit by a car; bruises and blood shown. Wearing casts on both legs, she's roughed up and thrown from her bed. A woman attacks a demon with a razor. A girl holds a box knife to her own throat. A girl beats up three men. Demon fighting.

A woman is smacked across the room by a monster, and a man's skull is smashed by a falling bureau (he also gets a blow to the back of his head). There's some blood, and a gun is brandished, with one shot fired. Other violent events are mentioned. Language includes a use of \"f--king,\" as well as \"hell\" (spoken by a child). There's a little flirting and a brief kiss. A bottle of whiskey is shown, and a character drinks from a bottle of beer. This installment is less inspired than its predecessors, but it's not terrible and has some decent scares.\n|Positive Messages|: Champions concepts like courage and forgiveness. The demons feed on hate and revenge, and the heroes realize that they can triumph by not feeding into those things, by forgiving and showing compassion and understanding.\n|Positive Role Models|: Elise Rainier is a most remarkable heroine in the horror genre: an older woman who's both vulnerable and brave. She's not afraid of ghosts, though she is endearingly human, with her own personal fears and faults.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Jump-scares. Scary stuff/creepy monsters. Young women are kidnapped, chained up, and held prisoner. A young girl is whipped and locked in the  basement by her cruel father. A teen girl uses powers to assault her father in self-defense.

The couple in the film (Mark Wahlberg, Rose Byrne) hit pretty much every road bump on the way to becoming a forever family. Expect occasional strong language (including \"f--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" etc.) and some drinking and drug/addiction references. There are comic accidents and one serious one (with a little bit of resulting blood). When a pedophile gets beaten up, it's played for laughs, as are some supporting characters' unrealistic/not genuine reasons for wanting to foster/adopt -- which could bother some families. The pedophile subplot isn't a major one, but it does involve an older (though still young) man preying on a teen. Ultimately the movie champions unconditional familial love and perseverance and argues that kids coming from extremely difficult circumstances are still kids who deserve love and a chance to flourish.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes unconditional familial love, despite difficulties and perseverance required. Underlines core belief that kids coming from extremely difficult circumstances are still kids who deserve love and a chance to flourish. Some characters' motivations for fostering/adopting aren't as genuine/realistic as others, which is played for laughs in the film.\n|Positive Role Models|: Strongly positive representations in main couple, who undertake challenge of fostering three siblings, including a rebellious teen. They're far from perfect but clearly capable of empathy and deep, selfless love. The kids struggle a lot and have behavioral issues, but they're ultimately reached by that love. Case workers are in it for the right reasons, and other foster parents are committed, caring. No prominent/specific \"bad guys.\" A birth mother struggles with her addictions, a would-be foster mom might not be in it for the right reasons (played for laughs). Occasional intolerance from family members. A pedophile is dealt with appropriately.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One kid is an accident magnet: He gets hit in the face with a ball, drawing blood, even accidentally drives a nail into his own foot. Parents beat up a young man who's preying on a much younger girl; although the violence includes punching his face and kicking his crotch, it's played for laughs.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One young girl falls prey to an older (though still young) man and is caught sexting/trying to take nude selfies for him. They're not shown -- nor is the nude photo he sends her -- but they're discussed.\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes rare use of \"f--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"p---y\" (as in the Russian band P---y Riot), \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"d--k,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"knob,\" \"jackass,\" \"pissed,\" \"oh my God,\" anti-Mexican slurs, and a few others. In several cases, the impact of the language is shown.\n|Products & Purchases|: Barbie is mentioned as something the youngest child wants, but the brand isn't shown or promoted.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some drinking, as when the exasperated mother unlocks the liquor cabinet and helps herself to some wine (not to excess). Verbal references to a birth mother's drug problem and to another foster child's struggle with addiction.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769cefb0d55001f530acd": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/interstellar", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Interstellar is a compelling sci-fi thriller/poignant family drama directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) and starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. As in Gravity, there are nail-bitingly intense (and life-threatening) sequences that take place in space, but this is more than a survival tale: It's a relationship story about a father who has made a promise to his children to return to them, no matter what. The layered themes, intergalactic peril, and references to astrophysics may prove too dark and complicated for elementary school-aged tweens, but middle-schoolers and up will be drawn in by both the science and the parent-child bond that guides the central characters to keep searching for a way to reunite. Characters do die (both in space and on Earth), and there's some language (\"s--t,\" one \"f--king,\" etc.).\n|Positive Messages|: Ultimately this is a story about the fierce love between a parent and his children. It explores the power of the intangible, unquantifiable feeling of love; the good of the man versus the good of mankind; and the certainty that there's more in the universe than we can possibly understand. The opening lines from Dylan Thomas' poem, \"Do not go gentle into that good night,\" are repeated again and again as a reminder to not be complacent or accept death when there's a possible solution that could save your life. Cooper encourages his children to look hard for the answers to their questions.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cooper is an attentive, responsive father who talks things through with his kids and always answers their questions. He sacrifices time with them in order to help the entire population of Earth, but he never forgets his promise to return to them. Amelia and her father believe in the virtue of sacrificing yourself for the good of the mission, but in the end, Amelia also understands that love needs to be taken into account, not just hard science. Murphy never stops looking for a way to explain her father's absence or to rescue the people of Earth.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes of intense, impending peril -- particularly the parts of the movie that take place in space. Several characters die -- mostly in space, but one on Earth as well. Characters are usually killed by a hostile environment, but one dies of natural causes. Two men get into a dangerous physical confrontation in space.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two adults kiss in celebration.\n|Language|: Strong language is infrequent but includes one or two uses of \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"dumb ass,\" and \"f--king.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Dell Latitude computer, several close-ups of a Hamilton watch.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a4c23d5a3001f502d86": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/into-the-storm", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Into the Storm is an extremely intense natural disaster film about how a group of storm chasers and a high-school assistant principal and his two teenage sons handle a deadly series of tornadoes that hits an Oklahoma town. The storm sequences are violent and deadly; each one leaves more devastation to buildings and people. Characters die, sometimes horrifically, during the storms, especially those who are swept up into a tornado vortex. The body count includes a few prominent characters, and everyone is in life-threatening peril. Language, which includes \"s--t\" and its many derivatives, is used in nearly every scene once the storms start hitting the town. There are also some references to sex and banging and hot women, but only a couple of actual kisses, one at the beginning and one at the end. Disaster movies can frighten some younger viewers even more than monsters or aliens or paranormal horror, so make sure you know whether your tween or teen can handle realistic depictions of weather catastrophes.\n|Positive Messages|: The overwhelming message is that storms can turn from severe to lethal, and people should always evacuate when asked to seek shelter. But if your family or people you love are missing, you must also do everything in your power to get them to safety. Also, as the movie makes clear, pretending to be a storm chaser when you have no credentials is a bad decision.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gary is always looking out for others; whether it's his students or his sons, he won't stop until he's protected those he cares about and loves. Some characters make selfish and dangerous decisions (like Reevis and Donk, who are just trying to shoot YouTube videos), while others are genuinely committed to helping track storms but not at all costs, like Allison. Pete redeems his early greedy behavior by sacrificing his safety to save others, and Donnie does his best to keep Kaitlyn calm during terrifying circumstances. Trey and Donnie are loving brothers to each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The tornado scenes can be really intense, with large-scale destruction to the town of Silverton and many people killed, including a couple of major characters. People are sucked into the vortices despite desperate attempts to stay attached to something on the ground. One particularly horrific scene shows a man being sucked into a fiery vortex screaming and pleading. Another man is shown in a vehicle as it's sucked up into the air and then comes slamming down, instantly killing him. Other characters nearly drown, have to be revived, and are injured during the storms.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Not much actual romance beyond the opening scene, when a teen couple is shown making out in the backseat of a car. Otherwise, limited to holding hands, mid-peril embraces, and a chaste kiss. But there are verbal references to desire and sex, like a teenager saying that in 25 years he hopes to have a \"smokin' hot\" wife he can \"bang,\" or a sophomore taking photos of a \"hot\" teacher with a great \"rack\" and lots of cleavage, or a high schooler asking his brother to \"get some skin on camera\" when he's with a pretty girl.\n|Language|: Most scenes include strong language, particularly the exclamation \"s--t\" and its derivatives (\"bats--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"s--tless,\" \"oh s--t,\" \"holy s--t,\" \"chickens--t,\" and more), as well as occasional use of other words, like \"d--k,\" \"jackass,\" \"ass,\" and \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of recognizable brands are featured fairly prominently, especially electronics and cars: Nikon, Apple (iPhone, MacBook, desktop), Dell, Skype, GMC, Coors beer, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Two supporting adult characters and their friends drink a lot of beer in the movie and are often drunk or on their way to drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768bcebdf2200209c79ae": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-intouchables", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Intouchables is an award-winning French drama based on the true story of a wealthy quadriplegic and his down-and-out personal aide. Like most odd-couple stories, the drama includes worthwhile lessons about friendship being deeper than the superficial differences that divide people (in this case, race, wealth, education, and physical ability). It's subtitled, but there are about 10 translated uses of \"f--k,\" as well as \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and other insults. There are several references to sex, an ongoing comedic flirtation between a man and an uninterested woman, and plenty of cigarettes, wine, and even some marijuana -- used both medicinally and for leisure.\n|Positive Messages|: The Intouchables offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, education, or physical abilities. Philippe and Driss' trusting, open relationship proves that race, status, and disability don't have to be obstacles to understanding and unconditional friendship. Disability also doesn't have to stop a person from finding love.\n|Positive Role Models|: Even though they're employer and employee and of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds, Philippe and Driss grow to respect and love each other, and each changes the other. Their odd-couple relationship transcends superficial differences and becomes based on their mutual ability to see beyond what others see in them.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Driss intimidates a couple of guys (one of them a teen) by shoving them against a wall and getting in their face. The police -- with guns drawn -- handcuff and act rough with Driss until they notice Philippe in the car. Driss' younger brother is under a drug dealer's thumb. An older woman slaps a younger man. At one point, Philippe, a quadriplegic, looks like he's in distress and even about to die.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man shamelessly flirts with and propositions an uninterested woman, who sometimes plays along by unbuttoning her top a few buttons while the man disrobes down to his underwear. Bikini-clad \"massage therapists\" (prostitutes) have to be told not try to go below the waist. Teenagers make out until they're interrupted. A woman who's revealed to be a lesbian suggests a \"threesome\" but is doing it as a joke.\n|Language|: The movie is subtitled, so only French speakers will understand the spoken curse words. But in the subtitles, there are about 10 uses of \"f--k\" and even more of \"s--t,\" as well as \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" and insults like \"moron,\" \"idiot, \" \"insane,\" \"jerk,\" \"crazy,\" and the occasional religious exclamation.\n|Products & Purchases|: A Maserati is prominently featured and driven. An iPod makes an appearance in a couple of scenes, as does a Kangol hat.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The movie takes place in France, where smoking cigarettes is still very common. Several characters smoke them, and adults are also shown smoking marijuana. Wine and cocktails are shown at every meal or party, and a teen girl purposely combines anti-diarrhea medication with painkillers after she's dumped (she's OK, though).

One character smokes a pipe throughout the movie, and one smokes a cigarette (accurate for the movie's '50s setting). \"Hell\" is said a few times, and Hogarth gives the villain a dose of laxative, which humorously results in trips to any bathroom he can find.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids will learn about the 1950s and get lessons about friendship, responsibility, and gun violence.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about behavior, life values, and important issues. \"You are what you choose to be\" and \"Don't care what anyone else thinks\" are verbalized and illustrated several times. \"Guns kill; things die; it's a part of life\" is portrayed by the errant shooting of a deer, along with \"Souls don't die; all good things go on forever and ever.\" The government's reaction to the Iron Giant reveals the paranoia and fear that were pervasive during the Cold War. Additional themes include communication, humility, and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Young hero Hogarth Hughes is resourceful, courageous, curious, compassionate, and intelligent. Though he sometimes ventures outside of his mom's comfort zone (and even his own), he's always well-intentioned and honorable. Hogarth's struggling single mom is portrayed as concerned, loving, and hardworking. The movie's villain, a high-ranking U.S. official, is depicted as ruthless, ego-driven, paranoid, and a threat to the heroes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon action sequences throughout: Boat in a storm, man goes overboard but escapes; a huge robot (the Iron Giant, who turns out to be one of the film's heroes) eats metal, destroys a power station, and tromps across the landscape, chasing the young boy hero and frightening people. Sparks fly, buildings fall. A deer is shot and killed. The robot is hit by a train, threatened, and shot at countless times by a squadron of armed military personnel. To defend himself, the robot creates havoc with some spectacular shooting and firepower of his own. Some spooky music accompanies old black-and-white TV footage.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Hell,\" is said three times; also an \"omigod\" and one \"butt.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mentions of Twinkies, Mad magazine, Action Comics, and Superman. Tie-in toys/products.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A secretary smokes a cigarette at her desk; a government official smokes a pipe throughout (accurate for '50s setting). A laxative is used to obstruct the progress of the movie\u2019s villain, with predictably humorous results (this plot line will probably go over the head of younger children).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776829151a60001f24b3db": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/iron-man", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Iron Man is the first of three popular movies centering on the superhero, and the film that set the stage for the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Although much of the violence is clearly meant to be based in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy -- or is shown at a distance -- there's plenty of it, from massive explosions to children being held at gunpoint to superpowered fistfights. Some of the violence is war themed, and some characters get hurt and/or die. While much is made of lead character Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) devil-may-care lifestyle of being a rich playboy, viewers also see him turn away from its more irresponsible aspects. Language includes \"son of a bitch,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\" Characters drink and gamble. Sexual content is more suggested than shown. The portrayal of Afghan kidnappers perpetuates Islamophobic stereotypes, and women are frequently objectified by the lead character.\n|Positive Messages|: The world isn't black and white, and a patriotic \"us vs. them\" mentality can oversimplify complex issues. It's important to question the morality surrounding the place of weapons in maintaining peace. New understanding can lead to change, but it can take courage to stick to your beliefs.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tony is a carefree, arrogant playboy who eventually discovers a conscience and tries to do good. He's captured by terrorists, which leads to a wider view of the war and the place of his weapons within it. Fellow hostage Yinsen offers him aid, assistance, and moral guidance, ultimately sacrificing himself for Tony's mission. Pepper Potts is smart and capable under pressure, though her loyalty to Tony leans into subservience. The villain is manipulative, double-crossing, focuses on greed and power over morals.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Stereotypes Muslims as terrorists. The original comic book set the cave in Vietnam, and this movie changed it to Afghanistan, likely to update for a post-9/11 audience. The women Tony interacts with are objectified and portrayed as beautiful trophies who easily fall for his charms. Even a successful, well-educated Vanity Fair journalist is quickly reduced to the latest of Tony's conquests. While the main character is White, Colonel Rhodes is a prominent Black character in a position of authority and is portrayed in a positive light as both influential in his job and a good friend to Tony.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extensive, constant sci-fi action and war violence. Characters (including kids) are held at gunpoint; adult villagers are rounded up and separated from their children; wounded characters bleed; a character is tied up with a bag over their head; people perish in explosions or at the hands of guns and other weapons; and scenes of torture include being held underwater and threatened with hot coal. Iron Man's armor shoots energy rays, micro-missiles, flames, and fireballs. Characters in high-tech armor have superpowered fistfights and cause damage to cars and buildings around them. Wires and a device are inserted into a character's chest. People are seen on fire, and glimpses of injury detail, including burns to the head, are shown. Iron Man drops a baddie at the feet of Afghani villagers, saying, \"He's all yours.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Making out and tumbling about in bed. A young woman wakes up in a bed covered only by a sheet, presumably after sex, and then walks around wearing just a man's shirt. Flight attendants dance suggestively (a dance pole is present but not used); much is made of Tony's reputation as a playboy. Flirting and sexual innuendo. Tony pressures his employee, Pepper, to dance with him at an event. She is reluctant at first but gives in.\n|Language|: Infrequent language including \"son of a bitch,\" \"pr--k,\" \"Jesus,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell,\" as well as the shortened term \"B.S.\" Sexual innuendo.\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related Marvel merchandise. Contextual references to Burger King, and characters drive Audi cars (both companies have promotional agreements with the film). Verizon cell phones. A montage includes several mock magazine covers with visible logos: Time, Newsweek, Wired, Rolling Stone, etc. On-screen, Tony's wealth is glorified.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Alcohol is consumed on occasion, including spirits and cocktails; one character enjoys a cigar, albeit mostly as a prop.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776834a091de001f2e7cf9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/iron-man-2", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Iron Man 2 has even more explosions and action than Iron Man, but it also ups the snarky humor and sexual innuendo. The two biggest concerns for parents are violence (while there's not much blood, there are plenty of bombs, weapons, and fights, as well as two men who are briefly shown hanging to death) and consumerism (several brands are featured again and again to the point that the movie seems like an expensive commercial for Audi, especially). Although there is only one climactic kiss, there are lots of double entendres and innuendo-filled jokes that may go over the heads of tweens and younger teens. Robert Downey Jr.'s  Tony Stark, is still not the role model of power and responsibility that Peter Parker is, but he knows when and how to help. Scarlett Johansson's character is strong, but she's so objectified it's hard to think of her as a role model to young girls.\n|Positive Messages|: Once again, it's clear (for the most part) who's \"good\" and who's \"evil.\" Tony Stark demonstrates courage and learns the lesson that just because you think you're going to die doesn't mean you should care only about yourself. Iron Man also discovers the importance of honesty, curiosity, and cooperation. He couldn't have defeated his enemy alone, but when he teamed up with his best friend, he was twice as powerful. That said, the female characters -- both primary and secondary -- are largely love interests or highly sexualized, even if they are strong and capable.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite the negative role models of the vengeful Ivan and the greedy Hammer, there are a couple of positive role models: Pepper Potts is a very loyal, honest, and caring character (if a bit whiny), and Lt. Col. Rhodes is probably the best role model, because he is willing to contradict Iron Man for the greater good, but he also trusts him enough to fight by his side when the situation calls for it. Tony Stark is an arrogant, self-avowed narcissist who tends to put his needs first but in the end always does the \"right\" thing to help others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of explosions and several dead bodies in the movie. One person dies of illness or old age, but the rest of the body count is from explosions and in two cases, hanging (that's the worst scene). Iron Man and Rhodey have a big fight that smashes up Stark's house and leaves both of them passed out. The fights with Ivan, including the climactic sequence, are the most violent, but there's almost no blood. Since Stark and his competitor Hammer are weapons designers, the weapons in the movie are fairly glamorized, especially the ones Hammer Industries creates, which Hammer shows off in an almost sexual manner to army officers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Although there's only one big kiss, several scenes feature women dressed provocatively, especially Natalie and a group of Stark dancers. There's a great deal of sexual innuendo in Stark's dialogue, particularly when he talks to or about Natalie, who in a couple of scenes is shown in her bra and in every other scene is wearing skin-tight, cleavage-baring outfit. Stark routinely says things like: \"I serve this great country at the pleasure of myself, and if there's one thing you can count on, it's me pleasuring myself\" or \"I want one\" (in reference to Natalie).\n|Language|: Language includes \"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" \"damn,\" a couple instances of \"ass,\" one use of \"bitches,\" and a few \"God\"s as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise. Several brands appear again and again, like Audi, which has at least two of its vehicle fleet featured prominently (including gratuitous close-ups of Audi's interlocking rings logo), in addition to its name/logo as part of the \"Stark Expo\" sponsors. Another heavily promoted brand is Oracle, and there is also a Rolls Royce. Pepper wears Christian Laboutin shoes with their conspicuous red soles and carries Louis Vuitton luggage. Real-life news anchors like CNN's Christiane Amanpour and Fox News' Bill O'Reilly's shows are shown.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters drink vodka, wine, champage and cocktails at dinners, parties, and to have congratulatory toasts. Stark gets drunk at his birthday party, and Ivan is often shown drinking vodka (sometimes straight from the bottle).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768ad3ab0e7001f50786e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/iron-man-3", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Iron Man 3 is another big-budget entry in the Marvel universe, and after the immense popularity of 2012's The Avengers, it will have huge appeal for tweens, teens, and adults alike. The violence is as explosive, large-scale, and pulse-quickening as you'd expect from this franchise. While the body count and mass devastation aren't as high as in The Avengers, scenes of both extremely destructive public bombings and casual shootings could be disturbing; overall, there's a bigger \"human\" factor to the violence here than in Robert Downey Jr.'s previous Iron Man movies, which involved more robot/machine action. On the other hand, there's less sexuality here (aside from a mention of a one-night stand and shots of women in bikinis or bra and panties) than in the other two, and language is on the milder side (one \"s--t\" and \"p---y,\" plus \"goddamn,\" \"jerk,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" etc.). Expect some drinking and product placement. Iron Man 3 is as much about Tony figuring out who he is without the suit as he is with it, and there are some mature themes about identity, anxiety, the dangers of unchecked power, and the necessity of a moral compass.\n|Positive Messages|: Iron Man 3 has some of the most obvious messages in the franchise to date: that with power and opportunity, even the purest of intentions can mutate into hubris, greed, and ruthlessness. It also deals with themes of identity, anxiety, curiosity, humility, and the necessity of a moral compass. There's a clear distinction between the heroes and villains, with the exception of one misguided character who's confused.\n|Positive Role Models|: At this point, Tony is a much different man than he was in the first movie. He's committed and selfless, he acts as a heroic father figure to a young boy, and he saves strangers as often as he does friends -- though there are also scenes in which he casually (and almost glamorously) kills a villain's bodyguards. Rhodes is Tony's steadfast companion and best friend; Pepper is generous and patient with Tony's stubbornness and mood swings.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Although the violent confrontations are most graphic toward the end of the movie, there are plenty of cringe-inducing images in the first half, too: The Mandarin stages executions and big bombings in several public places that cause a ton of collateral damage and critical injuries, a man is assassinated on camera (audiences hear the gunshot but don't see the dead body), and a house is blasted to smithereens by missiles. Guards/bad guys are killed casually. There's also a huge battle between mutated soldiers and Iron Man and his remote-controlled suits. Weapons include the high-tech Iron Man suits, guns, bombs and explosives, and fists, though there's less robot-on-robot fighting this time and more humans involved in the violent moments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Pepper and Tony kiss a few times. Pepper wears a sports bra and low-slung trousers in the movie's final sequence. In a flashback, Tony has a one-night stand with a woman who's briefly shown in her bra and panties. Also in a flashback, Tony makes jokes about \"going to town on\" a woman he's with for New Year's Eve. A villain views Pepper as his \"trophy,\" and a bunch of bikini-clad/lingerie-wearing women laze about in a Miami mansion (two of them await a man in bed at once in one scene). A few short scenes take place at a beauty pageant, with women wearing skimpy swimsuits.\n|Language|: Language includes one \"s--t\" and one teasing \"p---y,\" plus \"damn,\" \"d--k,\" \"what the hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"idiot,\" \"jerk,\" \"bloody hell,\" \"freak,\" \"spaz,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Slightly fewer product placements than in Iron Man 2, but there are still several prominent close-ups of Audi cars, a Dora the Explorer watch, the companies Oracle and Sun, and PBS' Downton Abbey. Skype is also seen/used.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink at a New Year's Eve party and at a bar. A character admits he had a problem with substances and is often seen chugging a beer. But this is Tony's soberest movie.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d46ad5437001f7d1d1e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/isnt-it-romantic", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Isn't It Romantic satirizes romantic comedies, following a woman named Natalie (Rebel Wilson) who gets trapped in a romcom world after suffering a head injury. The content is largely appropriate for teens. Violence is confined to cartoonish interludes in which Nat is struck by a car and hit in the head, both of which are played for laughs. Though Nat is interested in sex and talks about it, all she can do with her suitors is kiss -- after which the camera cuts repeatedly to a morning-after scene with her love interest (Liam Hemsworth) shirtless in a towel. Nat estimates a man's penis size as \"pepper grinder\" (the kind the waiter has to bring out to you). Characters drink in bars; Nat downs two shots of liquor to get courage to sing karaoke. Characters say \"s--t\" and \"bitch,\" but all except one instance of \"f--k\" are drowned out by noise, comically. Stereotyped characters (competitive women, shallow men, a flamboyant gay man) are used to make points about clich\u00e9d characterizations in other movies. Mocking the romcom genre's conventions will make viewers consider what such movies tend to say about women and romance and may spark conversations about the way women are depicted. Themes of courage and self-control are also clear.\n|Positive Messages|: By picking apart clich\u00e9s of many romantic comedies, film encourages viewers to think about the genre, what it says about our cultural views on womanhood. Themes of courage, self-control are clear.\n|Positive Role Models|: Natalie is forthright, genuine, a thoughtful, reliable person who cares about her work, her loved ones. She's not mocked for her rare-in-movies body type (except for joke about her being built like a \"truck\"). Blake is a stereotype inserted into the action to make points about typical romcom leads and standards of masculinity. Donny is also a stereotype -- in this case, a prancing gay man -- but his character is also used to make point about how gay men are often portrayed in romantic comedies.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence played for laughs: Nat is hit on the head twice, mugged, hit by a car. There's no blood, and impact of incidents is minimized.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In a knowing joke, Nat and her suitors can kiss, but action then immediately cuts away to a waking-up-in-bed romantic scene before she can actually have sex with anyone. A male character is shown repeatedly and at length in a towel, strolling out of the shower shirtless; Nat says that his penis is huge, the size of a large restaurant pepper grinder.\n|Language|: Cursing is ironic: Though characters say \"s--t\" and \"bitch\" (both jokingly and insultingly), anytime anyone tries to say the word \"f--k,\" some type of bleeping noise (from a truck, an alarm clock, etc.) drowns out the sound. At one point, Nat screams that she's in a romcom, and it's \"f--king PG-13!\" One unbleeped f--k is heard, when Nat wakes up from her dream and finds she's able to curse again. Swearing also includes \"t-ts,\" \"crap,\" \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink in bars, including a scene in which Nat downs two shots of liquor to get the courage to sing onstage.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776bb5ad5437001f7a78b8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/it", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that It is based on Stephen King's 1986 novel, which was previously adapted into a 1990 TV miniseries. It's very scary, and not just in a typical gory slasher or jump scare way; it generates actual tingles. (And if you're scared of clowns, it's even worse.) Things get pretty gory; characters are stabbed, impaled, and beaten with rocks and blunt objects. A boy's arm is bitten off, teens shoot guns, and a sheep is killed with a bolt gun. Language is also very strong, with a lot of the swearing coming from young teens; you'll hear \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. There's lots of bullying, and an abusive father acts in a creepily sexual way toward his teen daughter. You can also expect to hear a fair bit of sex-related talk among the teen characters, though much of it is na\u00efve and meant to be humorous. Teens will be eager to see this one, but it's not for sensitive viewers or the faint of heart.\n|Positive Messages|: Bullying is shown in different forms, from emotionally abusive parents to physically abusive teens -- and the ways the bullies are dealt with aren't always admirable. But the young teen characters show bravery in standing up against impossible odds, working together toward a common goal.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters are frequently troubled outcasts who are prone to iffy behavior or lying -- but they step up and are at their best when working as a team. The one female member of the group is shown to be as brave and strong as the boys, although she does require rescuing at one point.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very scary stuff, with a flat-out terrifying clown. Lots of bullying. Children are in peril: A child's arm is bitten off, and a bully carves up a kid's stomach with a knife. A bully stabs a man with the same knife; lots of blood. A bathroom is covered in blood, and characters spend a scene cleaning it up. A sheep is killed with a bolt gun. Rock throwing, with injuries. Broken arm. Clown stabbed through the face. Bullies shoot guns, taking aim at a cat. Kicking, smashing in head with toilet tank lid. Kids beat the clown with many kinds of blunt objects. A father is abusive psychologically, and acts in a creepily sexual way toward his teen daughter, too.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There are rumors that a teen girl has slept with many guys. Rather clueless attempts at sex-related jokes by 13-year-olds who don't know exactly what they're talking about (but they use terms like \"tickling your pickle,\" \"period,\" \"vagina,\" \"birth control pills,\" \"crabs,\" etc.). Teens go swimming in their underwear; the boys admire the girl.\n|Language|: Very strong language, much of it spoken by 13-year-olds, including \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"t-ts,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"d--k,\" \"f--got,\" \"piss,\" \"you suck,\" \"my wang,\" plus \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many empty beer bottles near an adult's (an abusive father's) chair in one scene.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d6cfb0d55001f59fdfc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/it-chapter-two", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that It Chapter Two is the follow-up to the hugely successful It (2017); both films are based on Stephen King's novel.

Violence/horror is very strong, with a shocking hate crime (bullies beat up a gay couple), a man abusing his wife (she hits back), and a character dying via suicide, as well as large amounts of blood and terrifying monster attacks. Children are skewered by oversized teeth, characters are stabbed with knives, and a gun is used in a scary fantasy scene. Language is also heavy, with multiple uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. Characters kiss, and there's some sex-related talk. Adult characters drink socially, and smoking (including by a teen) is shown. A brief \"drug trip\" sequence involves a hallucinogenic root. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd returns as Pennywise; Isaiah Mustafa, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Hader co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Though it takes a while to get everyone convinced and on board with what has to be done, it turns out that teamwork is essential for the characters to survive. Only when they stick together do they have the power to face the clown's attacks.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the characters are generally lovable and tend to show bravery when the moment truly counts, they're also deeply flawed, rather messed-up adults, and not exactly role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Scary clown attacks, biting and chomping children with huge, oversized teeth. Many scary creatures attacking. Lots of blood. In a hate crime, bullies beat and kick a gay character, smashing his face (lots of blood) and throwing him over a bridge.

Its mix of teen angst (the main character begins the movie feeling suicidal) and mental hospital drama and hijinks includes some salty language (including \"s--t\"), discussions about serious issues like suicide, and unsettling situations. There's also some kissing and making out and other references to sex.\n|Positive Messages|: The biggest message here is to choose life. Shape it, embrace it, make the most of it.

When Snoopy dresses up as a WWI flying ace, he hams it up during a pretend battle atop his dog house -- complete with flying bullets. Some of the Halloween imagery (ghosts, skeletons) may alarm the very youngest viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: Sticking to your beliefs no matter what others may think. Themes include empathy, integrity, and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: For all of Lucy's outward disapproval of her brother, Linus, and his silly Great Pumpkin, she asks for extra candy for him and wakes up in the middle of the night to fetch him from the pumpkin patch and put him to bed.\n|Violence & Scariness|: When Snoopy pretends he's a WWI flying ace atop his dog house, shadows of bullets fly by with sound effects, and he makes gun motions with his front paws.

Reacher is a former military police offer who's enlisted to find a sniper who fired six shots into a crowd, killing five people. This thriller is violent, and vigilante Reacher shows no qualms breaking the law to make sure justice is done -- at least his version of justice. There's some swearing (including \"f--k\" and \"s--t\") and a bit of sexual tension between Reacher and co-star Rosamund Pike, but no actual sex and very little drinking. Still, there are allusions to torture, and the fight scenes are sometimes brutal; a few are very tough to stomach. Even though there's little blood or gore on screen, the film is more appropriate for older teens and up.\n|Positive Messages|: Bad guys get what's coming to them, courtesy of Jack Reacher, a loner/vigilante who dispenses his own brand of justice, which mostly bypasses the legal system. That said, there's also the message that it's worth looking beyond appearances to find out the truth.\n|Positive Role Models|: Reacher doesn't hesitate to break the law to achieve his goals -- he participates in assault, auto theft, coercion, intimidation, and outright murder -- but all of his victims have it coming to them. (Well, mostly.) He uses smarts and intuition in many cases (in addition to his more violent methods). Helen is able to separate her emotions from her job.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of violence right from the start, when a lone gunman shoots five people with a sniper rifle (a scene that's revisited later in the movie). Jack Reacher, the main character, is a former soldier, highly trained with guns and in hand-to-hand combat, and the film finds plenty of chances to showcase his abilities. He takes on a group of toughs in a few street brawls, leaving them bloodied and sometimes with broken bones. Other scenes feature execution-style killings, allusions to torture, and men beating up women. Few of these scenes actually show blood or gore, but they do make it clear that bodies are taking serious damage and the people are in pain, and a few shots may be hard to watch. There's also a high-speed chase through city streets that damages plenty of cars.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One scene shows a woman in her underwear getting dressed; Reacher is shirtless in another. Some sexual tension between the two main characters never leads to anything. One scene has some flirty banter when a woman comes on to Reacher, though he's clearly not interested.\n|Language|: Relatively infrequent swearing includes a couple uses of \"f--k,\" plus \"p---y,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"prick,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several car brands are mentioned and/or get prominent screen time. Helen drives a Mercedes, and the bad guys spend a lot of time trailing Reacher in an Audi. Another character drives a Cadillac, which is referred to by name. Some of the characters drink Budweiser when relaxing, and Bud signage is visible in the background in a bar.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One scene takes place in a bar where plenty of people in the background are drinking, though Reacher sticks to coffee.

Like the first, this is a Tom Cruise thriller, so there's plenty of edge-of-your-seat action. Reacher is a one-man wrecking crew who leaves a trail of broken bodies -- only the bad guys, of course -- in his wake as he tries to right wrongs. Characters get shot, sometimes at close range (execution style), and are beaten to death. And while there's not much in the way of blood or gore, the fight scenes, especially the bone-snapping endings, can be pretty intense. On the plus side, there's no drinking, smoking, or drug use (though a cache of drugs is found). Sexual content is minimal (flirting, a shot of a woman in a bra), and swearing is moderate (mainly \"s--t\" and \"d--khead\"). And co-star Cobie Smulders plays a strong, capable woman who can keep up with Reacher.\n|Positive Messages|: Never give up, no matter what the odds. Always make sure to watch out for the people on your team; when you need help, they'll be there for you. But Reacher also frequently resorts to violence as a means of solving problems/achieving justice.\n|Positive Role Models|: Reacher is loyal to a fault and is always willing to put himself on the line to help someone who needs aid, without expecting anything in return. That said, he also does whatever it takes to achieve justice -- which often leaves wreckage in his wake. Susan is a strong, capable woman who holds her own against Reacher.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The body count gets pretty high. While Reacher doesn't usually carry a gun, he doesn't hesitate to take one from an opponent. And when there aren't any firearms around, he's pretty tough with his hands or any other object he finds laying around. Shoot-outs leave people dead. People are sometimes shot at close range, execution style. Many graphic fight scenes leave people beaten to a pulp or even worse. Some of these are quite extreme; even though there's almost no blood, gore, or lingering close-ups of the victims, the sound-effects (i.e. bones snapping) and suddenly limp bodies make for several cringe-worthy moments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting. One scene of a woman in a bra.\n|Language|: Occasional swearing includes \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch\" and \"Jesus\" used as an exclamation.\n|Products & Purchases|: A few brands/products get screen time, notably an LG phone and a Maserati sports car.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: No substance use, but a cache of drugs is found.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e16598c61c6140040d92467": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/jackass-forever", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Jackass Forever is the fifth movie (if you count Bad Grandpa) in the reality-based Jackass franchise, which is all about dangerous stunts, pranks, and pratfalls, as well as gross-out situations, cruelty, peer pressure, pain, and fear.

Expect to see real blood, injuries, pain, and fear, with performers being knocked unconscious, vomiting, being covered in excrement, getting zapped with a Taser, and being bitten by various animals.

Men's penises and testicles are zapped, punched, smashed, covered in bees, snapped by a turtle, etc. There's lots of full male nudity throughout, as well as brief sexual gestures.

Participants play cruel pranks on one another and laugh uproariously, even when the victim is angry and/or hurt.\n|Diverse Representations|: Most of the action features/revolves around White men. But Wee Man, a little person, demonstrates that there are no limitations for him; he can take on or endure anything that any of the others can. And after more than two decades, the crew has added one female member and two Black members. Some diversity among the guest stars, including mixed martial artist Francis Ngannou, hockey star P.K.

Rather than unrelated stunts, this one has a loose story and characters upon which to hang its hidden-camera pranks. The overall tone is lighter, less offensive and with more heart, although parents should keep in mind that the level of vulgarity and sexual innuendo is still very high. There are a few \"stunts,\" some arguing and fighting, and an old lady's supposed corpse that's dragged around throughout the movie. There are some sensitive, albeit fake rubber body parts shown and very strong, constant sexual innuendo (grandpa is forever trying and failing to pick up women). Language is strong and varied, but not constant; it includes \"s--t,\" \"f--k,\" and \"p---y,\" as well as most other words. The eight year-old actor says some of these words and drinks beer in one scene (\"Grandpa, I'm f--king wasted...\"). Grandpa is shown drinking, and drunk, fairly often.\n|Positive Messages|: Firstly, this movie exposes (or seemingly exposes) an 8-year-old boy to all kinds of strong language, sex talk and sexual innuendo, stereotyping, alcohol, robbery, dead bodies, and all around bad behavior. But on the other hand, the grandpa and boy eventually do form a real family bond, and even though they continue their negative behavior to some extent at the end, they seem to have formed a strong unit.\n|Positive Role Models|: The grandpa's behavior is constantly inappropriate with no consequences, and he exposes the little boy to all of it. Even though the grandpa and the boy love each other, you can't help thinking that the boy could do better.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This movie has less than the usual amount of dangerous \"Jackass\"-type stunts, though there are a few, such as when grandpa tries to fix a kiddie ride and finds himself catapulted through a store window. There's also some arguing and fighting, and some angry bystanders who don't know that they're being fooled. In one scene, a barroom full of \"Hell's Angel\"-types look about ready to beat up one of the actors. Grandpa's wife dies in the first scene, and her \"corpse\" (played by Spike Jonze) is carried around, dropped, stuffed in a trunk, and thrown off a bridge.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The movie shows Grandpa's fake, rubber penis stuck in a vending machine (it stretches as he tries to pull it out), as well as some fake, rubber testicles that hang down from beneath his tighty-whity underpants. A fake fish with human genitalia is shown. During the end credits, grandpa shows his rear from a car window. One scene takes place in a strip bar, with suggestive male dancers, but no nudity is shown. Mostly, the movie is filled with constant innuendo as grandpa tries (and fails) to pick up women. He uses all kinds of highly vulgar terms, pick-up lines, and stories. Many of these appear to be spoken in front of his eight year-old co-star. The characters also read magazines with ads and photos that feature strong sexual innuendo.\n|Language|: Language isn't as constant as you might imagine, but it does include lots of uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and \"poontang,\" as well as one or two uses of \"p---y,\" \"dick,\" the \"N\" word, \"c--k,\" \"suck it,\" \"prick,\" \"God,\" \"Jesus,\" \"damn,\" \"schmeckle,\" \"cooter,\" \"Jesus Christ,\" \"camel toe,\" \"jerkoff,\" \"ass,\" \"piss,\" and \"a--hole.\" The middle finger gesture is used. The words \"douche\" and \"faggot\" are spelled out (the latter spelled wrong on purpose). The 8-year-old co-star says some of these words himself.\n|Products & Purchases|: Most product names appear to be shown by accident. A Pepsi can is prominent in a couple of shots during a bingo game. One scene takes place in a convenience store, where many brand names are visible on the shelves.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene, grandpa drinks a six-pack of beer with the boy (trying to get a rise out of passersby). The boy spits out the beer but appears to drink more. At one point, he says, \"Grandpa, I'm f--king wasted.\" In a few other scenes, grandpa is shown drinking, and drunk; his beverages include beer and margaritas. In an early scene, the boy's biological father is shown smoking a bong during a Skype chat.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768358718ba001e3149a6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/james-and-the-giant-peach", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that in this adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic story, James and the Giant Peach, young James both loses his parents and is forced to live as a servant to abusive relatives.

Violence is the main issue, with lots of guns and shooting, brutal hand-to-hand fights, and more. Some wounds and scars are shown, but there's not much blood. There are wild car chases, riots, explosions, fire, and falls from high places. Several characters die. Language is infrequent but strong and includes \"s--t\" and \"bitch.\" Teens may be eager to see this high-profile actioner, but it's arguably the worst in the series, with most of the participants seeming bored and uncommitted.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie seems to celebrate the hero's violent behavior, championing his ability to beat up/kill anyone and to always be three jumps ahead. He sometimes suffers for all the violence he committed, but the movie exonerates him (it wasn't his fault).\n|Positive Role Models|: In earlier movies, Bourne might have been a \"cool\" spy hero, but here he's angrier and more burnt-out.

The use of blackface is certainly racist, but in one instance it's handled well, suggesting a connection between African Americans and Jews experiencing similiar identities as outsiders. The movie reveals the domestic discord of Jackie's family life and depicts a cruel father who whips and disowns him.\n|Positive Messages|: The most troubling issue in this otherwise squeaky-clean film is the use of blackface in performance. The genre of minstrelsy -- white stage performers imitating African Americans for the entertainment of white audiences -- was prevalent at the time this movie was made (the 1920s). The depictions here aren't the overt racist caricatures often presented by performers in blackface. In fact, the first scene -- in which viewers see Jolson's character applying his makeup -- is an artfully choreographed underscoring of his own status as an ethnic minority. A later scene in which he sings \"My Mammy\" is a more traditional (and racist) use of blackface on stage. The mammy archetype is an image of the black nanny and maid. In this scene, Jolson's character is singing to his teary-eyed mother, a woman he's been devoted to and has returned to as a good son and a star.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The father whips the son (off camera).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: The mother worries that her son is romantically linked to a \"shiksa,\" a mildly pejorative Yiddish word for a non-Jewish woman.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768382ec6b5001f6bc848": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/jimmy-neutron-boy-genius", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius has lots of cartoon action (explosions, crashes, falls, an alien invasion, air battle, spear-play) and some suspense (adults are abducted from Earth and threatened with being eaten by a dragon-like three-eyed monster), but it's always more humorous than violent. No one is injured or killed -- even the gooey alien life forms simply dissolve into green goo. Only the youngest or most sensitive kids might find it scary. Some comic potty humor (i.e.\" sugar booger,\" \"holy cow pie,\" \"I peed in the shower\"), is heard occasionally, the highlight of which is Jimmy's invention of burping soda. A mechanical dog poops metal nuts, bolts, and other hardware.\n|Educational Value|: Because Jimmy is a \"genius,\" kids are introduced to a number of scientific terms: meteor shower, asteroid, atmosphere, rocketry, etc.\n|Positive Messages|: Jimmy's behavior proves that it's valuable to be smart. Parents make rules because they love and want to protect you. Jimmy and his friends pay dearly for sneaking out of the house to attend an amusement park opening. The statement \"What your parents don't know won't hurt 'em\" is cleverly contradicted. Some clearly stated messages: Don't talk to strangers; be careful what you wish for; and don't be hard on yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jimmy and two friends are mocked for their differences (Jimmy is short and maybe too smart, one boy is a chubby and has asthma, and the third is obsessed with superheroes). Gradually, they earn the respect and admiration of their classmates. Lots of ethnic diversity. Female characters are smart, brave, and show that being female does not limit their abilities. Parents are loving and reliable, despite sometimes being slightly clueless. The only teacher is ditzy but brave.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comic action throughout. Jimmy's inventions constantly get him into trouble: He falls, vehicles explode; he is unwittingly responsible for an alien invasion. The heroes are endangered by: a meteor shower, an alien abduction of all the kids' parents, shock-inducing spears, an all-out air battle that pits the alien spaceships against the kids' jerry-rigged amusement park rides and includes explosions and electric bolts. Alien lifeforms are green and frog or slug-like. They utter threats like \"You all must die\" and then cackle. Jimmy's robotic pet dog is captured and menaced by the aliens.

There's a very high body count: Characters are shot, maimed, stabbed, beaten, threatened, killed with firearms at close range, blown to bits in an explosion, strangled with bare hands, and more. And especially because so much of the violence is depicted in a stylized, semi-glamorized way, it's best reserved for the oldest teens and adults. Interestingly, a streak of humor also runs through it, and fight scenes choreographed so thrillingly that it's almost like watching ballet -- albeit a gunshot-riddled, rough-and-tumble one. You can also expect lots of swearing (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more) and a fair amount of drinking, as well as pot smoking.\n|Positive Messages|: Your past may catch up with you, but that doesn't mean you have to let yourself get caught up in it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite being an assassin, John Wick is principled: He only hurts those who hurt others. Still, his \"field\" isn't exactly one that inspires admiration, at least from outsiders.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Brutal: It feels like two-thirds of the film is made up of killings, and much of the violence is presented in a stylized, semi-glamorized way. Characters are shot, maimed, stabbed, beaten, threatened, killed with firearms at close range, blown to bits in an explosion, strangled with bare hands, and more. There's blood everywhere. In one of the most disturbing scenes, a man clubs a puppy to death; a trail of blood is shown leading to its carcass. In another extended scene filled with mayhem, the body count exceeds three dozen.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couples are shown kissing.\n|Language|: Frequent language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several products/brands are seen, including Apple, Chevrolet, Mustang, Acura, and Peligroso liquor.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink, usually hard liquor.

Sex isn't an issue, language is infrequent (a couple of uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and the like, plus a middle-finger gesture), and substance use is limited to social drinking -- mainly expensive-looking whiskey or brandy -- and cigar, pipe, cigarette smoking by minor/background characters.

Though many parts of the movie are light and funny, others are deadly serious, with mature subject matter and violence that's disturbing, even if it's not especially gory. There are maimed soldiers, dead bodies, children carrying (and using) machine guns, and the hanging bodies of people executed by Nazis. One sympathetic character is killed suddenly and tragically, altering the tone of the movie. Children are orphaned and in frequent danger. An animal is killed on-screen (a boy twists a rabbit's neck around, then throws the limp body into the woods). Cursing isn't frequent but includes \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and one \"f--k off.\" There's also lots of upsetting hate speech about Jewish people and other enemies of the Nazi regime, but the movie's sympathies are clearly with the downtrodden. A boy's imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler, who's depicted as largely supportive and kind, if also a hateful fascist. Characters drink and get variously sloppy or elated, and many smoke cigarettes. The movie offers a nuanced take on a subject that's very difficult to mine humor from: Some people may be offended by its very concept, but it's more thoughtful and funnier than families might expect. Still, it's one that you'll want to talk about afterward.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of courage, empathy are clear in sympathetic look at those who are endangered and/or exterminated by Nazi regime. Racism is made to look ridiculous, as is mindless jingoism. Meanwhile, true acts of heroism are given proper, if satiric, weight, and viewers understand the danger of such moves. That said, some viewers may object to lighthearted scenes set among such pain and suffering, may feel concerned that movie doesn't give that pain proper weight.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters are complicated, with nuance. Rosie is nothing short of heroic, though viewers don't get to know her inner life as well as Jojo's. Elsa is brave too, suffering loss of her family, country, freedom yet still looking forward to a day when things are different. Jojo is complex, changes over course of movie from proudly racist Nazi to more sympathetic character who better understands suffering of those around him, performs heroic acts despite great personal danger. Terrible things are said about Jewish people, but it's clear that the movie's sympathies lie with them. Fascists are depicted as somewhere between evil and stupid. A young character with a larger body type is described several times as \"fat.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: Though the overall tone is light and satiric, that mood is disrupted by scenes of significant violence -- and characters are constantly in danger: chaotic gun battles with dead bodies and bloody wounds, soldiers in bloody bandages with missing limbs, and hanging bodies of people who were executed by Nazis. A sympathetic character is suddenly killed; another is held as a prisoner of war, and it's implied that he might have been shot (viewers hear soldiers yelling at him and then gunfire). Children are orphaned; one Jewish girl talks about seeing her parents get put on a train to a place \"where you don't come back.\" Young children are armed, sent into battle. A boy is told to snap a rabbit's neck; he refuses, but another boy does it, laughing, and throws the limp body into the forest.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young boy strikes up a friendship with a slightly older girl and gets a crush on her; he tells her he loves her, and she says the same to him, but it's unclear whether the love is romantic or friendly on both parts. She also offers to give him his first kiss; he refuses, saying it would be out of pity. Characters talk about love, comparing it to butterflies in the stomach. A character says her uncle had an \"inappropriate relationship\" with his niece; she blames it on \"Jews.\" A boy says that he's heard that Russian people \"eat babies and have sex with dogs.\"\n|Language|: Infrequent swearing includes \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"t-tty,\" and one \"f--k off.\" There's also a lot of hate speech about Jewish people (they have horns, they sleep upside down like bats, they love money, etc.), and a woman is called a \"disgusting Jew-y cow.\" Even some \"good\" characters have bad things to say about Jewish people, particularly earlier in the film, but it's clear that the movie's sympathies aren't with racists and fascists.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One character frequently drinks from a flask, seems sloppy and slurry; another drinks wine at night and then seems elated. A character tells a young person that when she's older she'll drink \"champagne when you're happy, and champagne when you're sad.\" Jojo's imaginary pal frequently offers him cigarettes; Hitler and others smoke cigarettes in many scenes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776f3c96b655001fe80905": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/joker", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Joker is an intense, complex, powerful thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix as the famous Batman villain. It's far darker and more violent than other takes on the character. Expect extremely graphic killings and blood spatters/sprays, guns and shooting, and stabbing. Several characters bully and beat up the main character, punching and kicking him, and there are scenes of fighting, rioting, rage, and shouting, as well as a scene of smothering with a pillow. There's brief nudity as the pages of a journal are flipped through, plus images and movie titles on porno theaters. The main character is shown with his hand down the front of his underwear, suggesting masturbation, and there's kissing. Language isn't constant but includes uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" etc. The main character takes prescription pills, and characters smoke frequently. The Joker isn't presented as a role model, but the movie does condemn those who do nothing to help the downtrodden get on their feet, which positions him as a somewhat sympathetic character. It also suggests that mental illness is one of the contributing factors to his villainous acts and behavior, which is troubling. The story disparages hate, anger, and unkindness, but it doesn't exactly promote kindness, love, or generosity.\n|Positive Messages|: Peripheral condemnation of the rich and powerful who do nothing to help the downtrodden get on their feet; if not for their selfishness, a monster like the Joker could have been avoided. But while movie disparages hate, anger, unkindness, it doesn't necessarily promote kindness, love, generosity. Connections suggested between mental illness and criminal acts/behavior, which is troubling.\n|Positive Role Models|: Joker is most certainly not a role model; his transformation and his discovery of his own strength and freedom involves violence, killing. It's an extremely negative portrayal of how a human should operate, but also possibly a cautionary tale. He's portrayed as having a mental illness, which impacts his trajectory -- a connection that may feel stigmatizing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely graphic killing, with blood spurts/spatters and dead bodies.

The moments of peril, such as a raging storm at sea, a van careening out of control on a country road, and Jonah and friend being swallowed by a whale (and worrying about dying), are handled with such a light touch that they are unlikely to scare most children. Jonah may be tossed into the water, but he is wearing a very reassuring ducky lifesaver ring, and the credits explain that no vegetables were hurt in the making of the movie. Jonah's story references only the Old Testament, except for the presence of a gospel choir and visual images of the cross in one sequence.\n|Educational Value|: Jonah is designed to promote values rather than provide information. The terms \"prophet,\" \"compassion,\" and \"mercy\" are clearly defined. Some geographical locations are shown, specifically Biblical cities in Israel. The visuals include animated characterizations of Middle Eastern terrain, ancient dress, architecture, and music.\n|Positive Messages|: Primarily advances the virtues of compassion (when you see someone in need and you want to help) and mercy (when you give someone a second chance even if they don\u2019t deserve it). These two concepts are introduced and cleverly repeated in multiple situations with a variety of characters. Along the way other positive-values messages are delivered: do not fight, do not cheat, do what\u2019s right, don\u2019t provoke, and many more.\n|Positive Role Models|: Leading characters are intelligent, resourceful, courageous, and forgiving. Jonah, the prophet-hero, makes a mistake, realizes it, and seeks forgiveness. Even the meanest people learn the lessons that are being taught and \"accept God\u2019s message.\" An early scene contains some very poor driving skills and irresponsible behavior: looking at a map and being distracted by passengers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon action and suspense throughout. The movie opens with a wild ride in which a van and its passengers careen down a hillside, crash through barriers, nearly run over a porcupine family, and hover on the edge of a cliff. No one is injured. Jonah and his shipmates are caught in a violent storm, but as the ship tosses and turns, all on board play Go Fish and don\u2019t appear panicky.

Stars Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan all return. And Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are added to the mix this time for some multigenerational humor as Spencer (Alex Wolff) and his motley crew of friends are sucked back into the perilous Jumanji video game for another high-stakes adventure. Not everyone lands in the avatar they originally inhabited, and the two seniors end up in the muscular bodies of Johnson's and Hart's video game characters. Violence remains a little dark, with the game characters dying in various ways, including animal attacks, being struck with poisoned darts, falling to death, and being blown up -- all of which ends up leaving many in a risky one-life-left state. But sensitive viewers should know the end is just as satisfying here as it is in the previous movie, and there are clear themes of teamwork, communication, empathy, and courage. You can also expect a fair bit of swearing (mostly \"goddamn\" and \"holy s--t\"), as well as a couple of references to bodies and body parts -- but not nearly as many as in the previous movie. There's less flirting and sexual tension in this installment in general, although there are still a few kisses and some general \"smoldering\" by Bravestone. A little bit of background drinking is seen.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes teamwork, communication, courage, empathy, generosity. Characters need one another's strengths to complete missions on each increasingly difficult level and finish the dangerous game. Teamwork requires trust, honesty. Other messages include idea that people need unconditional friends (their \"team\") all through life and that when you feel insecure and lonely is when you most need to reach out to friends.\n|Positive Role Models|: Original characters are brave, empathetic, know how to troubleshoot and solve problems and work together as a team, even with new additions. Eddie and Milo are as helpful and adaptable as they can be and learn from past mistakes, forgive each other, and become partners again.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Like the first film, many scenes of danger and death (though most of it just temporary). In game universe, characters start out with three lives, and each ultimately gets down to one life after dying in various ways. Some deaths are comically gruesome, like being attacked by a snake, ostrich, or mandrill; plunging to death; or being flattened by a rock. In an opening game sequence, it's explained that a villain killed a character's parents and had his fighters burn and pillage a village. Sad reference to terminal illness.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses (both in avatar form and in real bodies) between Martha (as Ruby Roundhouse) and Spencer (as Bravestone). Grandpa Eddie (as Bravestone) kisses a former flame a few times, while everyone else stares at them. Bravestone smolders with intensity. Nonsexual conversation about a eunuch (which a character has to pretend to be) and his legendary \"sacrifice\" and lack of testicles.

This time, instead of entering a board game, the players enter a video game. The popular stars, including Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, are likely to appeal to audiences of all ages. Expect some swearing (mostly \"s--t\" and \"ass\"), as well as action violence -- the main characters each die multiple times within the game (but they're regenerated quickly) -- and a couple of jump scares. Characters kiss and flirt awkwardly, and there are several references to dating, experience, and the humor of having a penis (one of the female teens is in a male avatar for most of the movie). There are also references to how girls/women can \"distract men\" with their attention and body, which doesn't send a great message to girls. That said, The Rock's character's body is also objectified. Still, there are positive themes here related to teamwork, empathy, selflessness, and communication, making this an easy pick for families who enjoy action adventures -- especially if they saw the original movie or read the Chris Van Allsburg book on which both films are based.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages about teamwork, communication, and generosity. The characters can't think only of themselves, because they need one another's strengths to complete tasks, go up levels, and ultimately finish the game. Teamwork requires trust and honesty. Other messages include the idea that friendship shouldn't be based on a person's social status and that everyone has ways in which they shine or stand out.\n|Positive Role Models|: The young characters all have to learn to grow, be brave, and work together in their adventure. On the other hand, young women are depicted as being good for distracting men by playing dumb, \"nasty,\" or \"totally into\" them.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many scenes of peril and death (though most of it isn't permanent). The four teens all start out with three lives in the video game, and each one gets down to one life. Their in-game deaths range from comical (one person explodes after encountering their weakness and later is trampled by rhinos) to matter-of-fact (one character is bitten by a snake and disappears) to frightening (a character is mauled by a jaguar). But after dying in the game, they return. In one tense moment, a character with only one life left is dying, but he's saved by another character. The villain can control animals on the island, and he kills a henchman with a scorpion bite. Several martial-arts, video game-like battles. A couple of jump-worthy moments involving a jaguar jumping into the frame and a snake hissing, pouncing.

Bethany teaches Martha how to flirt and use her sexuality to \"distract men.\" Martha (as Ruby Roundhouse) is uncomfortable dressed in a crop top and tiny shorts. A couple of kisses, both in avatar form and in their regular bodies. Spencer's body (as Bravestone) and smoldering good looks are a frequent topic of conversation. Sexualized comments about \"hitting that\" etc.\n|Language|: A few uses of \"s--t\" and variations on \"ass\": \"shut your ass up,\" \"badass,\" \"dumbass,\" and \"jackass,\" as well as \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"sucks,\" \"boob,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: The Sony brand is displayed several times (unsurprising, since it's a Sony film); other brands briefly shown include Instagram, Purell hand sanitizer, Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Metallica, Chrysler Pacifica.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene the teens (as their adult avatars) all drink blended margaritas, but two of them spit it out.

When the animals welcome him warmly, he's reluctant to complete his mission, which is to conquer Earth, but the animals try to help so that he can accomplish his task and go home. Mild cartoon perils are played mostly for comic effect.

With its blend of live-action and photo-realistic computer-generated effects, this action-packed adventure -- which was inspired by Disney's 1967 animated musical and has an all-star voice cast that includes Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, and Scarlett Johansson -- tells the story of young Mowgli (Neel Sethi), the orphaned \"man cub\" raised as a wolf and hated by the jungle's most vicious predator, tiger Shere Khan. There are several jump-worthy, intense moments (including one sudden and particularly sad death and several vicious animal fight sequences involving fangs, fur, claws, snarls, and roars) that are very likely to scare younger viewers (especially when seen in 3-D). Kids who are familiar with the story and know the animals they're seeing aren't real will probably be fine, but preschoolers and younger elementary-aged kids who have trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality may not be able to handle Mowgli's frequent peril. All of that said, on the definite upside, the movie is gorgeous, and there are clear, strong messages about the importance of courage, teamwork, family (especially the non-traditional kind), and friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages teamwork, friendship, and helping others. Family is where you find/make it, and change and innovation aren't to be feared. The wolf pack's motto is \"the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.\" There's also a sweet message for adoptive/non-traditional families, since Akela and Raksha view Mowgli as the same as their wolf cubs.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mowgli is curious, kind, and intelligent. He's courageous enough to try to protect both friends and strangers. Bagheera, Akela, and Raksha all took care of Mowgli from a young age and treated him as a member of their jungle family. Raksha and Akela raise Mowgli as one of their own, and Bagheera is a godfather of sorts who loves and protects him. Baloo is a faithful, if a little sneaky, friend to Mowgli, and by the end, the entire jungle has opted to protect their man cub. Shere Khan is driven by the thirst for revenge, which is clearly portrayed as an unhealthy obsession.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters die; one death is particularly sudden/shocking and upsetting. Others sometimes seem badly hurt/near death. Many scenes of peril, danger, and pursuit in which Mowgli is chased and menaced; he occasionally has some blood on his body due to scratches/abrasions/other wounds (he's also stung by bees in one scene). Animal characters fight each other in intense battles that involve teeth, claws, snarls, and roars. Shere Khan is cruel and scary; he and the snake Kaa both nearly kill Mowgli. Several jump-worthy moments when menacing animals pop up suddenly/threateningly, as well as when the monkeys kidnap Mowgli and King Louie gets angry. He commands his army to dispose of Baloo and chases after Mowgli fiercely. Forest fire scenes portray the \"red flower\" as deadly and unpredictable; a rainstorm leads to a mud avalanche that sweeps Mowgli into a raging river. It's sad when Mowgli leaves his wolf family; there are other scenes with hurtful words. Music intensifies many of the potentially scary scenes.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: One \"shut up,\" and one \"heck.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie itself, but Disney has all sorts of Jungle Book merchandise, games, apparel, toys, and more available.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Baloo is fixated on honey.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d3d96b655001fe439a7": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/jungle-cruise", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Jungle Cruise is an action-fantasy adventure inspired by the classic Disneyland ride. Set in 1916, it follows intrepid Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt), who hires skipper Frank Wolff (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) to guide her and her brother down the Amazon River in search of a mythical healing tree. Violence and peril are the biggest issues: Expect frequent danger, creepy cursed villains (as well as a cartoonishly evil German baddie), weapons (guns, torpedoes, swords, knives), an implied significant death (and some actual less significant ones), threatening snakes, and a jaguar that looks more vicious than she actually is. Adult characters drink from flasks and bottles, and an animal gets tipsy. One conversation about removing a knife from someone's body could be perceived as suggestive (though the double meaning will likely go over kids' heads), and there's some flirty banter and a couple of kisses. Without saying it outright, one character comes out to another, who's supportive. While main characters demonstrate impressive courage, perseverance, and teamwork, the movie's initial depiction of Native Amazonians as a tribe of angry cannibals is concerning, even though (spoiler alert) it turns out it's largely for show.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes courage, perseverance, teamwork. Characters work together and think creatively to defeat a curse, vengeful enemies, a sociopathic villain. Characters' stories/journeys promote idea of personal growth and value of acceptance and living a nontraditional life. You don't have to be what everyone expects you to be.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lily is a pioneering botanist and adventurer -- a Ph.D. who's never afraid of being the only woman in a room. She's brave, smart, resourceful, goes after what she wants (often bending rules to do so). Frank is knowledgeable, protective. Both are willing to put themselves in danger for their missions -- and each other. MacGregor is a dedicated brother who accompanies and supports Lily; he implies but never says outright that she was the only person who stuck by him when he realized he was gay. Native Amazonians are initially portrayed as cannibal warriors out to capture (and eat) foreigners, but (spoiler alert) it turns out to be for show. Still, the story exploits those stereotypes and certain others (MacGregor is fussy and high maintenance, Joachim is cartoonishly German, etc.), and Joachim's accent is played for humor.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril/tension, action violence, physical comedy, creepy imagery -- including conquistadores being turned to stone or coming back to \"life\" while made of bees, snakes, etc. Native Amazonians are killed, a villain is squashed. At one point, it's suggested that a key character has died. People get abducted, slapped, stabbed, bitten by snakes and piranhas, threatened/attacked by a jaguar. Falls, chases, explosions. Torpedo and guns fired, swords and knives brandished. A villain callously smashes bees. Amazonians are described as cannibals, but (spoiler alert) it's just for show. Arguments/yelling.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lily and Frank banter and flirt, eventually sharing longing looks. Characters share a kiss. A conversation about extracting a knife borders on suggestive.\n|Language|: \"Oh my God,\" \"ruddy,\" \"fresh hell,\" \"crusty old farts,\" \"shove it up your association,\" \"booga booga,\" \"wimpy,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: This movie is based on/promotes a Disney ride. Lots of merchandise tie-ins off camera.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink in taverns, where some background characters seem to be drinking heavily.

There's tons of suspense, many \"jump\" scenes, and some chases/crashes; basically, the characters -- including children -- are in near-constant peril. Expect a bit of mild swearing (as well as one \"s--t\") and some smoking and drinking, too. In the less intense environment of home, kids as young as 9 may be able to handle the fright factor with an adult at hand, but sensitive children should skip this one.\n|Positive Messages|: Just like Frankenstein, there's an underlying message about the dangers of playing God. But through teamwork, determination, and smarts, the main characters triumph. They also learn and change; Alan learns how to protect/care for the children, and the kids learn to survive in the wild.\n|Positive Role Models|: The two children are intensely likable, smart, and brave; the adults protect them and each other at every turn.

Some children will nevertheless find it very upsetting, especially because one of the characters is a child. But the child is brave, smart, and resilient, which some kids will find very satisfying. Divorced parents reunite and live happily ever after at the end of the movie, which might give kids the wrong idea about how divorce actually works.\n|Positive Messages|: Critiques of man trying to play God are embedded throughout, as man's interference in nature has clearly gotten out of control.

Mature tweens and teens who are fans of suspense/action (and still fond of dinosaurs) will be thrilled -- just make sure they can handle the truly jump-worthy scares.\n|Positive Messages|: Science and nature can't be controlled, and animals shouldn't be treated as predictable, passive attractions.

Claire initially doesn't seem like she cares about anything besides her job, but she quickly goes into mother-bear mode to rescue her nephews. Zach has to step up and take care of his little brother, Gray. Despite his age, Gray is quick-witted and intelligent and helps the boys get themselves out of dangerous situations. The park owner and other secondary characters all rise to the occasion to save others.

Set four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the story unites Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the newer films with scientists Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) from the original movies. Together they must fight the villainous CEO (Campbell Scott) of an international genetics/agricultural corporation who's lying about how the company uses dinosaur DNA. Expect plenty of jump scares, human-eating dinosaurs, and epic predator-on-predator fights, but there's a slightly lower body count in this installment than the previous ones. Language includes occasional use of \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" etc., and there are a few embraces and kisses between two different couples. This cast is notably intergenerational and also features more women than others in the series have. As with all Jurassic films, this film continues to explore themes related to science, nature, ethics, teamwork, and prioritizing people over profits. Integrity and perseverance are also on display.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes are in line with the rest of the franchise's: Science and nature can't (and shouldn't) be controlled; wild, large animals shouldn't be treated as weapons to manipulate; people matter more than profits. There's an ethical line between science and cruelty. Teamwork, integrity, and bravery are important when dealing with animals -- and other people. Everyone has a choice to change and make better and more ethical/moral decisions.\n|Positive Role Models|: Owen, Claire, and the three scientists are brave, protective, compassionate. Owen and Claire are more focused on saving their daughter; Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, and Dr. Malcolm are interested in saving the world. A couple of conflicted characters grow and change allegiances, but the primary villain remains a stereotypically egomaniacal/quirky tech CEO.\n|Diverse Representations|: Diversity within supporting cast: a Black pilot presented as queer, a Black scientist, and an Asian American scientist who's had a recurring role in the franchise. More female characters in this installment. The ensemble is multigenerational.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several jump-worthy, potentially terrifying scenes of sustained tension and peril. Child in peril on multiple occasions. Dozens of people die, but only a couple of characters with speaking parts perish: They're eaten (whole or in pieces), dismembered, trampled, mutilated. Most characters are injured in some way. Apex predator dinosaurs are especially frightening; other dinosaurs are taught to relentlessly track and kill anyone identified as target. Bloody fights between dinosaurs, which slash, hunt, kill one another. Weapons-based and close-combat violence between humans includes tranquilizer guns, automatic guns, hand-to-hand fighting. Frightening scene of oversized killer locusts that decimate farms and terrorize two children.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting, banter, a few full-body embraces.

And there are lots of intense scenes of sustained terror, suspense, and peril, including a prolonged sequence in which a very scary genetically modified dinosaur tracks and tries to kill a young girl. People are eaten, torn to shreds, trampled, and severely injured. Language is infrequent (occasional use of \"damn\" and \"Jesus!\" and one \"holy sh--\" that's cut off before completion). There's only one real kiss (and some flirting). Expect a fair bit of product placement, especially Apple products and luxury cars.

(Note: A much longer extended cut of the film is also available; this review reflects the original theatrical release.)\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's biggest message is about the importance of team building and working with others for the greater good. Each of the superheroes alone couldn't defeat the enemy, but together, they're much stronger. Also shows how a team's (or neighborhood's or society's) different strengths and abilities are what make it powerful.\n|Positive Role Models|: Each member of the team is courageous, selfless, and brave, but they also have to learn to communicate, work together to highlight one another's strengths, and listen to a leader, depending on the circumstances. Wonder Woman continues to be a strong role model. Although her beauty is still remarked upon, it's not what makes her exceptional. Batman realizes he's not the ideal leader and learns what being part of a team means. The Flash must learn how to get out of his comfort zone to help save people. Cyborg finally believes that his new life (and body) have value.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of large-scale superhero-movie violence: huge explosions, widespread destruction, battle sequences. There's no gore (with the exception of the parademons' gooey green blood), but a giant monster tosses even the superheroes around like they weigh nothing, kills foes, and destroys buildings. A resurrected Superman angrily fights with and injures Batman. A family is armed but can't fight the parademons; they nearly die but are saved at the final moment. Tons of weapons (swords, guns, hammer, trident, lasso, shields, etc.) and hand-to-hand fighting.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Shirtless shots of various male characters; a couple of scenes of a reunited couple kissing and embracing. Mentions of Wonder Woman's beauty/attractiveness.\n|Language|: A few uses of strong language, including \"s--t,\" \"s--thole,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell, \"damn,\" \"Jesus,\" and \"son of a bitch.\" A couple bleeped uses of \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Several shots of expensive Mercedes cars; lots of tie-in merchandise, including apparel, games, figurines, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink in pubs and alone. Aquaman downs a bottle of liquor and then throws it into the sea. Bruce and Diana have a drink together.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769b67a53e9001e6ee457": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/justin-and-the-knights-of-valor", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Justin and the Knights of Valor is a full-length animated film with some original songs. It takes place in medieval times with knights, ladies, wizards, and great villains, but in terms of jokes, characters, and some story elements, there is a modern sensibility (such as the inclusion of a stereotypically effeminate villain with a love of fashion; the young hero is torn between becoming a knight to save his kingdom or \"going to law school\"). There\u2019s lots of comedy and plenty of cartoon action, including swordplay, stabbings, and a threatening fire; a villain falls to his death. A Spanish production with prominent English-speaking actors, this theatrical film was released internationally in 2013 but is making its American debut as direct-to-DVD.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork is a plus in overcoming adversity. Ordinary people can sometimes surprise with their heroism. A questionable but clearly stated message is: \"If you go against your dad, you have to believe in yourself.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Justin, an ordinary young man, learns that he is capable of greatness. His good intentions and ultimate belief in himself enable him to be brave and resourceful. Lawyers and \"the law\" are particularly targeted in this movie, blamed for ruining the preferred \"old\" way of life -- of knights and valor and chivalry and beauty -- because they instituted rules and laws. Of course, the key lawyer who initiated the changes finally learns the error of his ways. Lots of stereotypes are included: A very effeminate (but still lethal) accomplice of the primary villain prances around eyeing \"color\" and \"design;\" a vain, self-absorbed rich girl dismisses a worthy suitor; and a preening knight believes he is a supreme gift to humankind.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent cartoon action and violence: swordplay, crossbows, attacks by strongmen. A silly crocodile-like dragon wreaks comic havoc. Characters are pummeled, stabbed, thrown, chased, and captured, and they fall -- a villain plummets to his death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One kiss.\n|Language|: Insults are uttered in disgust: \"pinhead,\" \"idiots,\" \"dunderheads.\" Some characters are the objects of laughter and derision.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Several scenes take place in a pub, with beer served in flagons.

The Karate Kid was re-made in 2010 with a younger perspective starring Jaden Smith. It has a fair number of swear words (including \"s--t\"), insults, and fights -- as well as a scene of marijuana use. This is a standard new-kid-in-town flick, but it's also got soul thanks to the teacher-student relationship between wise Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) and lonely teen Daniel (Ralph Macchio). Issues of class, race, (teen) romance, and even war are explored in this coming-of-age tale, where karate is a metaphor for life.\n|Positive Messages|: Even though one character says that \"fighting doesn't solve anything,\" the script seems to indicate otherwise. The movie also deals with remembrance of U.S. wartime injustices. But hard work, dedication, and discipline are all valued. Respect for your elders is important.\n|Positive Role Models|: There's a very clear line between the good guys and the bad guys. Daniel is inspiring in his tenacity to learn, and Mr. Miyagi is a worthy teacher. Characters demonstrate self-control, perseverance, and courage. It's worth noting that a Vietnam veteran is depicted as a psychopathic scoundrel.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several fights -- mostly outside of the martial arts competition. Fistfights, which are usually five-on-one, end in black eyes and bruised ribs for Daniel and his rivals. During the karate competition, the sparring is \"sanctioned,\" but people still end up hurt.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Daniel and Ali flirt, go on dates, and kiss/embrace. Johnny kisses Ally without her consent, and she pushes and slaps him.\n|Language|: Language includes \"s--t\" and its derivative \"bulls--t,\" \"jerk,\" \"sucks,\" \"stupid,\" and other mild insults like \"old man,\" \"weakling,\" and \"coward.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The antagonist, a high-schooler, rolls a marijuana joint.

Some of the karate is vicious, and the trouble-making participants do not adhere to the principles of the martial arts. There are a few bloody fights. One sequence that might be frightening to young viewers finds tough guys threatening and endangering two heroes on a steep cliff. Mild coarse language is heard occasionally. Mr. Miyagi, wise mentor to The Karate Kid, is referred to as a \"slope,\" an Asian slur. One character smokes cigars and drinks champagne.\n|Positive Messages|: Mr. Miyagi continues his education of The Karate Kid: \"You must not lose to fear, only to your opponents.\"  Brute strength and revenge lose out to hard work, inspiration, and firm belief in yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: The wisdom and quiet integrity of Mr. Miyagi continues to provide guidance to The Karate Kid.  He lives what he preaches. Daniel learns another valuable lesson from his mentor and once again proves to be worthy and rewarded.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of karate, some with the authentic moves, poses, etc. In other instances, participants are more vicious and cheat, purposely trying to hurt opponents.

The movie has a positive message about finding your place even when you feel like an outsider. There's some violence (a character is crushed by rocks, a mother dies of sickness) and language (\"ass,\" \"dumb,\" \"lame brains\"), but ultimately there's a feel-good ending.\n|Educational Value|: Kids might learn facts about various wild animals, particularly zebras.\n|Positive Messages|: The positive messages include not judging others by superficialities, working together for the common good, and knowing that friends come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Khumba's mother never lets him think of himself as a misfit. She loves him as much as her other children. Khumba's sister also is supportive and doesn't treat him like an outsider.

It centers on a relatable, regular English schoolboy named Alex (Louis Ashbourne Serkis), who's chosen to wield Excalibur and save the world. The movie is tween friendly (it's kind of like The Goonies crossed with Lord of the Rings), but families with younger kids should be aware that the villains -- evil Morgana (Rebecca Ferguson) and her minions -- are creepy, dark, and quite scary. Several violent battles/confrontations involve the destruction of a school, tense chases and pursuits, gouts of fire, and lots of swordfighting/weapons and close-range combat. While none of the kids is seriously injured, there are plenty of close calls. Characters also argue and deal with fairly intense bullying. There are a few uses of words like \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"oh my God,\" as well as insults (\"ignorant buffoon,\" etc.), but nothing overly salty. One character briefly walks around naked, but nothing at all graphic is shown. Families will be able to discuss several positive messages in the story, including teamwork, perseverance, courage, loyalty, and more.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes idea that anyone who's pure of heart and noble in character (i.e., brave and compassionate) has potential for greatness, not just those with royal blood or special background. Encourages loyalty, honoring those you love, persevering and overcoming challenges, doing the right thing, working as a team, telling the truth. Also a major theme about importance of not leaving people behind, standing up to bullies, empathizing/seeking middle ground with others that could turn them from adversaries to allies. You shouldn't have to change who you are to get ahead. Also, even when world seems like an unstable place, there's hope for change -- especially in motivated young people.\n|Positive Role Models|: Alex is courageous, compassionate; he stands up to bullies who are bigger and older to defend his best friend. Bedders is kind, summons his courage to join Alex as a knight. Kaye and Lance redeem themselves for their bullying, selfish ways. The kids all learn from their mistakes, learn how to work together. Merlin is a quirky but helpful guide and mentor; he can't always save the kids, so he does his best to teach them how to succeed on their own merits. Morgana is clearly evil; she's said to represent greed, entitlement, vengefulness. Diversity within main cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Shape-shifting villain Morgana is incredibly creepy in every form, especially as winged, demonic-looking creature. Her armed dark army is also scary: Horse-mounted mud creatures with fiery eyes, weapons (like ring wraiths in Lord of the Rings); they attack the kids, even invade Alex's home. Creepy skeleton warriors, evil trees attack the kids. Suspenseful chases/big battles between Morgana/her army and kid knights and schoolmates; at one point, Merlin looks done for. Morgana breathes fire, destroys a lot of the school, while kids use homespun weapons to defeat her. Apocalyptic vision of future if kids don't succeed. Lance and Kaye start out as bullies who pick on Bedders and Alex, taunting, threatening, pushing them, making Bedders hang upside down, etc. Alex gets in a fight with Lance, who later wants to retaliate with Kaye as backup. Alex falls in a construction site, looks injured. School kids throw food/items at \"Mertin.\" Alex reluctantly points his sword at his mom to get out of house. Animated battle violence in opening backstory sequence. Talk of instability throughout world: fear, crisis, division. Kids argue.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: When young Merlin first arrives, he briefly walks around naked with a blurred-out bottom. No romance. Merlin needs to consume \"beaver urine\" as part of his reviving potion.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words/phrases including \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God\" (repeated a few times very quickly), \"God's socks!,\" \"thank God,\" \"godforsaken,\" \"what the hell,\" and \"what the flip.\" Insults/rude words like \"Lego mini-figure boy,\" \"stupid,\" \"shut up,\" \"hate,\" \"Percy Jockstrap,\" \"ignorant buffoon,\" \"liar,\" \"cheat,\" \"bully,\" \"nothing.\" Morgana calls the kids \"meek,\" \"greedy,\" \"callow.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Google Translate, Fiat, Mario Kart, YouTube, Led Zeppelin T-shirt, Uber.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Talk of a father who used to drink to the point of anger/excess.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776871e6d55c0020413484": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-kids-are-all-right", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this witty, worldly dramedy about a lesbian couple whose teenage children decide to acquaint themselves with their sperm-donor father deals frankly (and compassionately) with all of the complications that could arise in that situation -- including marital discord, infidelity, biological identity, nature vs. nurture, and letting go of a child on the brink of adulthood. Thanks to those themes and some other fairly mature content -- including partial nudity (breasts, buttocks) during sex scenes, clips from a pornographic movie, swearing, and teenage drinking and drug use -- The Kids Are All Right is best for older teenagers and adults.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's central messages revolve around parenting, presenting it as a difficult task, but one with infinite rewards if you do your job right. It suggests that being a parent goes way beyond titles -- what is a mother? what is a father? -- and that it's who you are and how you treat your kids that makes you a good parent (or not). The film also seems to be saying that growing up requires some distancing from our parents -- a dicey transition that can bring out the worst in people, at least for a little while.\n|Positive Role Models|: Nic and Jules are devoted to their children, and even though they make mistakes, take each other for granted, and are prone to bickering, they love and respect each other. Paul steps up and embraces fatherhood, despite his unusual path to that role. And although teens Laser and Joni push boundaries, they're aware that their actions have repercussions for which they should be responsible.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A teenage boy berates and belittles his friend and hits him. Men and women hurt the ones they love both with actions and with words.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man and a woman are seen having sex; her breasts are visible, and his behind is shown thrusting. Teens watch a pornographic movie that shows men hooking up with each other (their behinds are visible). A woman goes under the covers and performs a sex act on her female partner.

It's set in the early 1900s and, like the other films, has tons of over-the-top fighting and action violence, with lots of blood and some gore. Expect to see guns and shooting, sword fighting, knife fighting, death, drowning, children in peril, violence against goats, and disturbing imagery of war and a concentration camp. Language includes many uses of \"f--k,\" plus \"scheisse\" (German for \"s--t\"), \"shite\" (Scottish for \"s--t\"), \"bastard,\" etc. There's an incriminating sex film in which a woman is shown stripping and performing simulated oral sex (seen from. distance; non-explicit). There's also passionate kissing, strong sex-related dialogue and innuendo, a sexual gesture, shirtless males, and more. Adults drink socially, and the main character drinks heavily and gets drunk following a death. Ralph Fiennes, Harris Dickinson, Djimon Hounsou, and Gemma Arterton star.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie tries to decry violence, particularly the violence of war, but it also thrives on it, with many scenes of gleefully over-the-top fighting and killing. It also claims that since governments are both clueless and ineffectual -- and easily manipulated -- when it comes to stopping (or not starting) wars, the best way to handle this problem is for private citizens to do it themselves.\n|Positive Role Models|: Orlando Oxford is part sleuth and part warrior; his plans sometimes don't quite work out, leading to huge fight scenes. He uses his wealth and status to try to help others but is also prone to thinking about himself in certain cases.\n|Diverse Representations|: The main character is a White man who has two loyal assistants: a powerful White woman who's a skilled spy, and a Black fighter who's skilled with knives. They definitely serve him and are secondary to him, but he couldn't get by without them. Characters from many countries are represented, but other than those two key characters, the central cast consists mainly of White men.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extreme comic book-style action violence, with lots of blood and some gore. Heavy guns and shooting; many characters are shot (including in the head) and killed. Wounds. Sword fights/death via sword. Knife fight; stabbing. Characters are held under water and drowned/nearly drowned. Scenes of WWI trenches, with lots of shooting and explosions. Character with shot-off, mangled leg.

Like the first one, it's an extremely violent, over-the-top action movie with comedy elements. This time around, though, there's a bit more empathy, and more value is placed on human life. Intense action violence includes tons of gun use/shooting, martial arts fighting, punching, kicking, knives/stabbing, explosions, car chases, blood spurts, dead bodies, and much more. Language is also strong, with many uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. On the sex front, there's a scene in which a woman offers to let a man pee on her; he then inserts his fingers (and a tracking device) under her panties and -- it's implied -- inside her. The main villain is a drug dealer, and all drug users are threatened with death. Pot and meth are seen, and there's plenty of social drinking, sometimes to excess. Colin Firth, Channing Tatum, and Taron Egerton co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: The story includes revenge, but one of the themes is that life becomes more valuable if you put your heart on the line and allow yourself to care about something or someone. Life is more precious in this sequel than in the original. \"Manners maketh man\" is still important here, but slightly less so.\n|Positive Role Models|: Eggsy is still shown as kind and loyal, even going so far as to phone his girlfriend before performing a spy duty that requires him to be intimate with another woman. He succumbs to one moment of revenge, but otherwise, he stays true to his heart and to his team. A supporting female character is tired of being passive and in the background and takes agency to become (naturally) an agent. But besides the villain, most other female characters are girlfriends/objects. Little diversity in principal cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Fewer meaningless deaths in this movie than in the original, but still mass amounts of extreme destruction and mayhem. Violence is strong and stylized/over the top -- with martial arts, fighting, punching, kicking, guns and shooting, knives and stabbing, hitting with fire extinguishers, electric lassos, bullwhips, exploding land mines, neck snapping, etc. Some blood sprays are shown. Blood spurts from the eyes and nose of drug users. Characters die. Characters fall into a meat grinder. Teeth are sanded down.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man reaches under a woman's panties with his fingers to plant a tracer (shown in pretty extreme close-up, with the camera then switching to an internal view of her body). A woman says that a man can pee on her. Kissing. Woman in skimpy underwear.\n|Language|: Frequent language includes \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" \"pr--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"bollocks,\" \"goddamn.\" Also \"God help us.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The villain is an international drug dealer, and all drug users -- both casual and habitual -- become ill with a deadly virus.

It's funny, cheeky, and stylish, but it's also extremely brutal, with exploding heads, gory stabbings, shootings, and utter murderous mayhem (a scene of mass carnage inside a church is especially wince-inducing/stomach-turning). While the violence is presented in a stylized, almost cartoonish way, the sum total of it is likely to disturb some viewers. There's also swearing (including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and some racial/homophobic slurs), sexual innuendo, a gratuitously tasteless scene with a naked female bottom, and drinking. But there's also a smattering of advice about how to be an honorable person in a dishonorable time.\n|Positive Messages|: \"Manners maketh man\" is an enduring message. Also, class and money aren't what define you -- your character does.

Scenes include hatchets to the head, a man sliced in half, gunshots at close range, crashes, stabbings, a man impaled on a pole, explosions, eye gougings, heads exploding, and much, much more. It's gruesome yet glamorized, and the sum total is unsettling.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A woman's naked backside is shown as part of a tasteless, sexist, sexually provocative joke.

The people come out ready to fight with weapons at the sound of the war bell. The two families lay traps for each other, spend lots of time trying to come up with ways to terrorize the other side. The two families chase Klaus and Jesper, who nearly plunge to their deaths. The town square has a noose and a battle bell.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Jesper and Alva flirt and eventually kiss and become a couple. Two members from feuding families fall in love and marry.

And despite the body count, there's very little blood or gore. Expect plenty of flirting between stars Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise and a little kissing, with some brief talk about sex. There's also some drinking (including one scene in which Diaz's character gets drunk on tequila), and various \"spy\" drugs are introduced throughout the movie. Neither of the main characters are depicted as strongly positive role models for teens, but that's not what the movie is about, either -- ultimately, it's meant to be a fun adventure for adults and older kids.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's key theme seems to be that if you want to try something exciting, go ahead and try it -- without too much concern for consequences (even when death and killing is involved). And as June starts hearing different stories from different characters, she must learn to follow her heart and trust the right person.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though June eventually finds her footing and her strength, she's very passive for large portions of the story. Roy shoots and kills several bad guys over the course of the movie with no consequences or remorse -- but he's clearly meant to be a good guy who has the best intentions and a positive outlook.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie is filled with action violence (much of it played for humor) -- including guns, hand-to-hand combat, and lots of other fighting -- but has little gore or blood. The body count is fairly high, but the impact/consequence of that fact is contrasted by the film's overall light tone. The hero is shot, and viewers see his bloody (but minor) wound. There are also drug-tipped needle darts, several explosions, car chases, motorcycle chases, and bull chases.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The two main characters are clearly attracted to each other, and there's plenty of flirting and a few major kissing scenes. In an early scene, June preps herself in the bathroom, hoping for some kind of connection with Roy when she emerges. In another scene, the couple rolls around on the beach. In a late scene, June (while under the influence of a truth drug) says, \"I'd like to have sex with you. I bet we'd have great sex.\" Roy changes June into a bikini while she's drugged, which angers her (even though he says he didn't look).\n|Language|: Languag includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" one \"f--k,\" and terms like \"hell\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A Bud Light ad is visible on the side of a building for a few seconds.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: During a tense plane ride in the first section of the movie, June drinks a lot of tequila to calm her nerves; the scene is played for comic effect. Roy also takes a drink. The agents are also always slipping various drugs to each other; June gets a \"knockout\" drug twice and a truth serum once.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77707e6afb3d002061b768": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/knives-out", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Knives Out is a delightful all-star murder-mystery comedy that's reminiscent of Agatha Christie stories. Violence includes a murder victim with a slit throat and a trickle of blood, fighting (punching and slapping), arguing, and harsh dialogue. Language includes one \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" and more. There's a bit of sex-related talk, and one character is said to have had an affair. People drink at a party, characters smoke cigars and pot (there's a secret stash of joints), prescription meds are injected, and there's dialogue about a morphine addict. Starring Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, and many more, this expertly crafted movie is both a satisfying mystery and a hilarious comedy with appealing characters, and it even touches on the state of the world today and sends the message that kindness and compassion are virtues that win the day.\n|Positive Messages|: Kindness and compassion turn out to be virtues that win the day. There's also a message about lying; one character is incapable of lying without becoming physically ill.\n|Positive Role Models|: Quite a few of the characters are shown to be selfish and/or greedy, but many are delightful and fun. Still, they're all so one-dimensional that no one is really role model material. But Marta is shown to be kind and compassionate, and Benoit Blanc is smart and persistent.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dead body with throat slit. Blood streaming. Fighting, slapping. Frequent arguing.

Set in the 1970s, the movie follows a group of scientists on a mission to survey a mysterious island in Southeast Asia. That's where they encounter several dangerous giant creatures, including an ape trying to protect his habitat (there are also giant birds, a spider, an octopus, and reptilian creatures). Things get pretty brutal, with victims being dismembered, stomped on, eaten, and tossed around; helicopters also crash and are ripped apart. So you can expect a high body count, with scene after scene of jump-worthy action, death, and gore. The language can also be strong, with one use of \"f--k,\" plus several uses of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" etc. There's also some social drinking, but sex is limited to embraces and very brief implied prostitution in a couple of scenes set in Vietnam and Thailand. Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, and Oscar winner Brie Larson co-star, accompanied by a diverse supporting cast; themes include teamwork and courage.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes teamwork and not judging others by their appearance -- even seemingly violent creatures. By listening to one another instead of jumping to conclusions, the soldiers and civilians are able to ultimately work together to save Kong and the island. One of the soldiers poses the idea that an enemy isn't an enemy until you threaten his home and family. The idea of sacrificing yourself for the greater good is examined.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mason is a courageous conflict photographer at a time when most photojournalists were men. Conrad starts off just working for the money but realizes there's more at stake than just cash. Kong at first seems like a bloodthirsty killer, but he's revealed to be an ardent protector of his home and those in it. Randa has good intentions, but he lies and keeps things secret when he should have told others the truth from the beginning. Packard cares about his men, but he also seems more interested in vengeance than saving the men's lives. Marlow is kind and generous with his knowledge about the island. The natives aren't really portrayed in more than a superficial manner. The cast is diverse compared to movies actually made in the 1970s or about the '70s.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence can be graphic and brutal, and the body count is incredibly high. Kong rips apart and causes several helicopters to crash into each other and into a river, instantly killing soldiers and civilians. He stomps on people, casually throws them, eats them, and dismembers them. Other giant creatures also kill, injure, or dismember victims, including giant birds, a spider, and an octopus, as well as Kong's main rivals: giant, slithering, reptilian creatures that fight both him and the humans. The battles are violent and gruesome, and there are many bloody and jump-worthy moments. A couple of characters sacrifice themselves to buy their friends a little more time to escape. One character nearly drowns.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of brief scenes set in Southeast Asia bars/brothels imply prostitution. Scantily clad women in bikinis and lingerie dance provocatively or grab soldiers by the hand. Mason and Conrad flirt and touch each other protectively; they embrace and touch foreheads. Two scientists flirt and hold each other.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--king,\" as well as more than a few uses of \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"a--,\" \"badass,\" \"mother-\" (the rest is cut off), \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" \"life just punches you in the balls,\" and \"bulls--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: One quick close-up of a Sony camera.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink in a seedy bar.

Those expecting child-friendly animated fare may be surprised by scenes in which jokes are mined out of sexual innuendo. For instance, in one scene two characters misinterpret the word \"proposition\" to mean \"offering money to a prostitute for sex.\" A character accidentally puts the wrong film onto a movie screen, and the title \"Stag Reel\" appears with a large picture of a stag; the character acts embarrassed as if the film is the slang term itself. Before a romantic montage involving baking bread, the male character says to the female character, \"things are about to get ... hot.\" Older people are tricked out of their money and lodging and are portrayed stereotypically as befuddled, toothless, hard of hearing, and prone to scratching their behinds.

A character mistakenly puts a film on a screen called \"Stag Reel\" -- there's a picture of a stag, but the character acts embarrassed as if it's actually the slang term.

Like those films, it has more darkness and edge than many average kids' movies and is best suited for tweens and older, rather than the preschool and early-elementary set. It has scary characters and epic battles that can be quite intense and that lead to character injuries, an entire village burning (though the villagers survive), and even deaths. Language is limited to a few insults (\"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" etc.) and romance to a couple of embraces and references to a past love story. Despite the peril, this epic adventure set in an alternative fantasy Japan has strong themes of courage and teamwork. And at heart, it's a mother-and-son love story, as well as the tale of a young artist learning how to be a hero.\n|Positive Messages|: You're the hero of your own story. The people we love are never completely gone, because they live in our memories and our stories about them. Your story will live on even after you're gone. Courage, teamwork, and empathy are strong themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kubo is loving, brave, and kind. He's a talented storyteller, a devoted son, and a courageous hero once he has to go on his journey. Mother isn't always lucid, but when it counts, she's loving and protective of her son, using her magic to save him. Monkey is a fabulous female role model; she's not human, but she's assertive, brave, and encouraging. She doesn't talk down to Kubo and helps him understand he must prepare to defend himself. Beetle is loyal and protective of Kubo and Monkey.\n|Violence & Scariness|: From the opening scene, there's peril and violence in the story. Characters are injured and die. Kubo's eye was stolen by his grandfather, and his father was killed. The fights between the Sisters and Mother and later the Sisters and Monkey, Beetle, and Kubo are intense. Beetle is unexpectedly stabbed in the back after a battle is seemingly over. The huge, scary skeleton almost eats Kubo and his friends, and Kubo almost drowns in another sequence because of hypnotizing sea creatures. The Moon King turns into a frightening giant serpent. An entire village is burned down, but most of the villagers survive the fire. Kubo and his mom wash away upon a shore to hide, and his mom hits herself on the head. The scene in which Kubo is spotted is spooky; his masked aunts say his name in a really eerie way.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kubo's mom recalls how she and his father met and fell in love. In between bickering, Monkey and Beetle flirt a bit, and she gives him a soothing massage.\n|Language|: Occasional insults like \"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" \"an embarrassment,\" and \"weak.\" Swear stand-ins like \"ohhh foot!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film itself, but plenty of real-life merchandise/promotional tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A villager smokes a pipe.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768323c3c2a001fbcd974": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/kung-fu-panda", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that kids are sure to enjoy Kung Fu Panda, which stars Jack Black as the voice of the relatable main character, Po. And its humor and heartwarming story will appeal to grown-ups, too. The movie boasts positive messages about being who you are and believing in yourself, but it is martial arts-themed, so expect plenty of fast-paced battle scenes with kicks, punches, falls, and more. Even though they're animated, some sequences -- especially the one in which intimidating villain Tai Lung escapes from prison -- may be too scary for kindergartners and younger. Families who buy this on DVD as part of the \"Pandamonium Double Pack\" are also getting a cartoon short called Secrets of the Furious Five.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Po discovers that there's no secret ingredient to greatness -- you just have to be yourself. This positive theme resonates throughout the film. The issue of eating as a coping mechanism is raised (Po has to learn self-control to break that habit). Additional themes include integrity, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Po also has a good attitude in general, taking the Furious Five's initial chilliness in stride and ultimately giving his all to his training. Bad guy Tai Lung is a total bully -- but flashbacks soften his character slightly.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Not surprisingly, there's lots of martial arts action -- expect tons of high-flying clashes that include punches, kicks, falls, and more. That said, the fights are generally more thrilling than frightening, though they could upset kids 5 and under -- particularly the sequence in which villain Tai Lung breaks out of a maximum security prison.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Fairly clean, though the word \"suck\" is used prominently, and insults are hurled at Po by nearly everyone.\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of mentions of the fictional martial arts movies that the Furious Five and other kung fu masters were in.

Po (again voiced by Jack Black) and the rest of his kung fu clan must defeat a new villain who's armed with gunpowder and cannons. The movie's surprisingly poignant, sometimes serious story addresses the conflict between tradition and modernization, as well as Po's discovery of a long-hidden tragedy and his journey to accept an unusual upbringing. Not surprisingly, there's plenty of action -- including explosions, swordfights, and lots of kung fu fisticuffs. Scenes involving parent-child separation could also be upsetting for kids. Unlike the first film, this one is offered in 3-D, which can make some of the sequences feel more intense.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate, but it offers positive lessons about friendship and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: The main message is that family is important, but it's not always defined by blood: The people who love and nurture you are also part of your family. The film also focuses on the need to let go of ancient slights that can only drag you down and instead seek to achieve inner peace. Integrity, perseverance, and teamwork are additional themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Po is a great example of someone who must learn to accept -- and resolve -- complicated personal relationships. At first he refuses to acknowledge some hard truths, but eventually he's able to attain inner peace, and the results are powerful.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of hand-to-hand combat. The fight scenes are fast and furious, but hardly anybody seems to get injured. An important theme here is modernization, as the martial arts warriors must face off against an opponent who's armed with gunpowder and cannons.

This time around they face Kai, a scary supernatural bull monster that menaces all of China. Po and the others must fend him off in a series of frequently intense battles that may scare kids; some could also be upset by flashback scenes of parent-child separation, conflict between characters, and moments when it seems like key characters are captured, in danger, and/or possibly gone for good. Expect a little insult language (\"stupid,\" \"loser,\" etc.) and potty humor, but aside from the violence, there's not much to worry about in this effective, entertaining story about family ties (Po meets his long-lost biological father) and establishing your identity. Blended families may particularly like the way that Po's two-dad situation is handled.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate, but it has nice lessons about embracing what makes you special and finding ways to use your talents for the greater good.\n|Positive Messages|: Integrity, perseverance, and teamwork are important themes. Strong message about identity -- finding your true self, what you're best at, and what you love. Po is told by Shifu: \"If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now.\" And you should be and embrace who you are, not who someone else is. Also, family is more than biology; it's accepted that Po has two dads. While violence remains the main means of conflict resolution, the pandas fight the bad guy with a coordinated effort that involves lobbing food (and themselves!) more than weaponry.\n|Positive Role Models|: Po is always enthusiastic and positive; he takes his responsibilities very seriously, works hard, and ultimately embraces what it means to be a friend and teacher. Po and his biological dad build a strong (but also playful) relationship, while Po's adopted dad is included, not excluded or thrust aside. Tigress remains a strong female character, and her gentler side is brought out more in this installment. The only iffy character (besides the villain, of course), is Mei Mei, who makes romantic overtures toward Po in a way that shows her in a foolish, love-crazed light, with no other personality trait. Some of the other pandas are a bit single-note as well, but in a lighthearted way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of martial arts fighting, both in groups and one on one. Villain Kai, an angry supernatural bull monster, is intense and scary, as are his jade warriors. Sad flashbacks to Po's separation from his mother when he was a cub. Key characters are captured/in danger. Po makes a big sacrifice that could upset some kids. Additional creative fighting via the use of Chinese food -- spring rolls, dumplings, etc. -- as well as nun-chucks and other means of attack. Perilous trek to panda village.

But it also tackles material that may be too heavy for younger viewers, including underemployment, feeling lost in the early years of your career, questioning your abilities, and fighting to stay in the moment while searching for your purpose. Expect some swearing (including one use of \"f--k\"), as well as social drinking, kissing, and characters waking up in bed together.\n|Positive Messages|: Though some may use the word \"dreamer\" as a slur, don't let it get to you. Without dreams, we don't have achievements. Also: Love doesn't take a straightforward path; it often ends -- and begins -- in unexpected places. And it shows itself in many ways.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mia is kind, authentic, and determined to achieve her dreams. Even in the face of failure, she finds a way to right herself and keep going.

A few scenes are potentially scary, including a climactic one where dogs try to protect a baby who's threatened by a beady-eyed rat. During an accident, a secondary character appears to be killed, but he later appears mildly injured. The Siamese cats are more mischievous than mean, but they may seem creepy to young kids, and also embody racist stereotypes. Humility, integrity, and romance are themes throughout, with the two main characters ending up together raising puppies.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, not educate, but kids might learn a bit about dog licenses and dog pounds, as well as get a glimpse of an era where horse-drawn carriages were the norm.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about being a good friend, protecting and helping the vulnerable, loyalty, standing up for what's right, and not judging others based on their status. Additional themes include integrity and humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lady is loyal to her humans, especially the baby. Tramp is protective of both Lady and the baby and puts himself in harm's way for both. Lady's friends are initially judgmental but learn from their mistakes. On the other hand, Aunt Sarah is harsh and inflexible.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: The romance between Lady and Tramp overcomes class lines. But the Siamese cats, Si and Am, are racist caricatures of Asian people, from their design (eyes and teeth) to the broken and accented English they sing in. At a dog pound, heavily accented dogs portray stereotypes of countries their breeds are from, such as Pedro the Mexican Chihuahua and Boris the Russian Borzoi. Disney has added a content warning on Disney+ before the film that reads \"This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lady gets muzzled by a mean human. She's chased by some fierce-looking dogs. She winds up in jail (the dog pound) briefly. Lady meets two Siamese cats who are mischievous and creepy. The climactic scene involves a beady-eyed rat threatening a baby and then a frantic chase where one secondary dog character briefly appears to be dead.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some romance between Lady and the Tramp including the famous scene where they unexpectedly kiss when slurping a spaghetti noodle.

The human dog catcher, who hunts Tramp the entire movie, gives the remake a menacing villain, and the other dangers to the animals -- other dogs, cats, street traffic, the rat -- may feel more threatening now that they're more lifelike. Sequences that could scare little kids include when Lady is imprisoned in the dog pound, when Tramp lies unconscious after being tossed from a moving vehicle, and when the rat pounces on the baby's crib. There's a potentially upsetting scene of what happens to dogs that don't get adopted. As Lady (voiced by Tessa Thompson) and Tramp (Justin Theroux) fall in love, they share a couple of flirtatious moments, including the classic spaghetti scene. \"Dang it\" is used, and characters appear to drink a toast together. This take on Tramp is a little mangier than the original, but the cast of human characters imbues the classic tale with a welcome new diversity.\n|Educational Value|: The characters teach us not to judge others by their appearance or background.\n|Positive Messages|: Humans and dogs can be loyal to their own and to each other. Belonging to a family or community gives life meaning. Despite its allure, freedom from attachments like family can be lonely. A stable home life is healthy, but an occasional howl at the moon is, too. Everybody deserves love. Don't judge a book by its cover. Courage and teamwork are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dogs and humans stand up for and protect their friends and family, even if it means putting themselves potentially in harm's way. Some adults, including a mean aunt and a dog catcher with an unhealthy obsession with Tramp, behave cruelly. Different kinds of dogs learn to respect one another's differences. The cast is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Dogs face peril from cars, rats, cats, other dogs, and a villainous dog catcher who hunts them down to lock them up.

The film offers lots of introductory information about dinosaurs -- species, the planet as it was when they lived, their fight for survival. Kids who watch this movie should be clear and comfortable with pretend violence versus real violence. The young dinos face scary, sharp-toothed, roaring predators who chase them with an intent to kill in multiple sequences. They are at risk from natural disasters as well: earthquakes, a volcanic eruption, rock slides, and fire. The sad death of a parent after a battle early in the film and the separation of several young dinosaurs from their families are important to the story. None of the young heroes is hurt, and the tale is happily resolved. Released in 1988, this film became a full-fledged toy franchise with DVDs, television, sequels, and a wide variety of associated products.\n|Educational Value|: Introduces various species of dinosaurs, providing simple-to-understand information about species, habitat, family, and survival.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes teamwork, unselfishness, interspecies tolerance, resourcefulness, and perseverance. Clear references are made to \"the circle of life.\" Although he's told that dinosaurs stick with their own kind, Littlefoot is a friend to everyone. Individual strengths are important to the group's success and survival. Illustrates power of family relationships throughout animal kingdom. Additional themes include compassion and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Littlefoot is friendly to everyone, sticks to his task, and makes wise choices. Parents are shown as responsible, caring, and wise. Baby pterodactyl Petrie finds flying too difficult but with courage finally achieves it. Stubborn Cera thinks she doesn't need any help from anyone else but sees that she does need her friends and they need her, too.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent cartoon action and violence: Carnivorous Sharpteeth (Tyrannosaurus rex) are predators who continually chase, menace, and attempt to kill the young heroes. Little Foot and company are faced with separation from family, earthquakes, rock slides, falls, volcano eruptions, fire, and constant fear of the predators. In one, early fierce battle, Little Foot's mother is killed. The little dinosaur grieves for her. His sadness and belief in her spirit play an important part in his journey.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Original movie generated an active franchise, which includes television, DVDs, toys, related merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683e5af944001f1fbd5e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-land-before-time-ii-the-great-valley-adventure", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, is part of a series of movies starring animated baby dinosaurs. While some of the scenes involving large, snarling, and sharp-toothed dinosaurs might be a bit scary for younger viewers, the overall takeaway from this movie is the importance and beauty of the cycle of life, from youth to old age. Characters care for an unhatched egg and learn the ways of nature when the hatched baby dinosaur must follow its ingrained needs for survival. Watching this movie can inspire discussion between parents and kids about the responsibility and care of animals.\n|Educational Value|: The movie illustrates the cycle of life -- from birth through old age -- in an age-appropriate way. It also teaches that different animals have different needs -- like some dinosaurs eat meat and others don't.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, responsibility, and friendship can accomplish great things. The cycle of life, from birth to old age, is a beautiful process. Not everyone is the same, and that's what makes life interesting.\n|Positive Role Models|: Little Foot cares deeply for his friends, and does his best to help them whenever he can.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some of the larger dinosaurs snarl, growl, and reveal sharp teeth.

There are additional great lessons about yelling and working to express negative emotions more constructively.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters are fairly simplistic but realistic: Children are playful, with an innate sense of justice. Adults are present and concerned, and though some exhibit close-mindedness, territorialism, and poor communication styles, they eventually see the error of their ways and work to improve.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There is occasional peril throughout: In one scene, a meteorite strikes and causes a mudslide, threatening the safety of the dinosaurs. In another, dinosaurs intimidate and charge each other in a fight. A fast-spreading fire threatens the dinosaurs' safety, sending a young dinosaur tumbling down a cliff.

In this tale, a band of young dinosaurs join with Little Foot, the kind and brave hero, to rescue his dad from the aftermath of a volcano eruption. On their journey, the little ones must wend their way through a series of adventures, which provide cartoon danger and suspense (a sandstorm, a rock slide, chases by scary predators, and falls from on high). Though there are no injuries or deaths, it's still best-suited for kids who understand the difference between pretend and real violence. Reba McIntyre and Damon Wayons, Jr. provide the voices for guest characters, with McIntyre singing one of the four original songs that accompany the easy-to-understand story.\n|Educational Value|: Portrays a number of prehistoric dinosaurs (apatosaurus, pteranodon, triceratops).\n|Positive Messages|: Places great value on teamwork, resourcefulness, optimism.

It's ambitious in its attempts to address toxic masculinity and female power, but its length and structure make it frequently clunky and repetitive. Expect extremely gory battle violence, with slicing, stabbing, and buckets of blood. A brutal rape scene is shown twice. A bloody male corpse is stripped, dragged away, and hung; horses die horribly; and more. There are also brief but explicit sex scenes, including a character shown with five partners who are naked in bed. Men are shown thrusting on top of women, and there's full-frontal nudity. Language includes variations on \"f--k,\" a use of \"c--t,\" and a use of \"damned.\" Characters guzzle wine during a party scene, and a secondary character drinks frequently throughout.\n|Positive Messages|: Though it doesn't offer clear answers and leaves off in a pessimistic way, movie clearly demonstrates horror of what women can go through when they stand up against sexual predators, as well as immense strength it takes to do that. Against backdrop of barbaric laws (i.e., rape is not a crime against a woman, it's a crime against her husband, whose \"property\" she is), these themes stand out in sharp relief.\n|Positive Role Models|: Marguerite is the movie's real and only hero. There's pressure for her to keep quiet and simply endure what happened to her, but she risks absolutely everything, even her unborn child, to try to do the right thing -- to stand up and perhaps encourage others to say that this is not OK. Male characters are depicted as entitled, unable or unwilling to listen to women's point of view.\n|Diverse Representations|: As is typical for historical movie set in medieval Europe, characters are all White. But unlike many movies of this type, a strong woman emerges who isn't just there to serve and support her husband. She's still locked in by limitations, laws, and beliefs of the time, but she stands out as powerful and brave.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A brutal rape sequence is shown twice. Overall, movie is extremely gory and bloody: brutal sword fights with slicing and stabbing, a bloody joust battle, terrible wounds, and blood sprays, drips, and puddles. Characters die, and death is discussed. Bruises on woman's shoulder. A bloody corpse is stripped, dragged away, hung. Flaming arrows; a character is hit in head with one and catches fire. Man grabs woman in threatening way. Punching. Deer's neck sliced open. Horses brutally killed during duel. Dialogue describing violent acts (lashing, burning, etc.).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief but explicit sex scenes. Men thrust on top of women, climaxing rapturously. A man is shown with five partners, all naked in bed. Some appear to be pleasuring one of the group; she moans passionately. Full-frontal female nudity. Brief full-frontal male nudity (a corpse). Sex talk, sexual innuendo. A stallion mounts a mare.

It's a nonstop barrage of bleak, terrifying, realistic, and raw scenes of sexual assault, bloody murder, and sadistic violence. And unlike many other horror films, where a supernatural entity is behind the bloodletting, here it's perfectly average people committing horrible crimes and acts of vengeance. Next to this bloodbath, the swearing, drinking, sex, and drug use may seem less egregious, but they're there all the same.\n|Positive Messages|: While the film is ultimately about a father and mother punishing those who've hurt their daughter -- with several characters making important ethical and moral choices -- the film is deeply violent and frightening, with no concrete positive messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: Even though the parents' rage and grief is somewhat understandable, none of the movie's characters act in a way that you'd want anyone imitating.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Brutal, bloody violence, including graphic stabbings and shootings, fist fights, a graphic (and protracted) rape, scuffling, falls, murder by hammer, a man's hand being wedged into an operating garbage disposal, a woman being burned with a cigarette lighter, and a man's head being exploded by being heated in a microwave while he's alive. Bloody depictions of impromptu surgery, wound cauterization, and medical care. Car crashes. A man is strangled with a seat belt, and another character is shot, point-blank, through the eye. Constant depictions of agony, suffering, and brutality.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some topless female nudity, and lingering shots of female characters in underwear.

The action moves between modern day and the 1960s as Ellie (Felicity Jones), a journalist, and Rory (Nabhaan Rizwan), an archivist, find some letters belonging to two lovers from the 1960s, played by Shailene Woodley and Callum Turner. The movie is about both love and regret with characters left wondering \"what if.\" It also examines our relationship with communication and very much celebrates the written word. The sexism portrayed in the 1960s scenes may spark conversation among families. In one scene, a husband is seen roughing up his wife, threatening her with more violence. In contrast, women are portrayed as having much more agency over their decisions, and their bodies in the present day -- as depicted by Ellie choosing to have several one-night stands. Sex is discussed on several occasions, but is only depicted once, when two characters engage in intercourse up against a wall. A car accident results in the death of a driver -- they are seen with blood on their face. Characters use \"f--k\" frequently, as well as \"s--t.\" There is also a lot of smoking, particularly in the flashbacks where cigarettes are smoked in restaurants and offices. Drinking is frequent too, with one man evidently drunk, and another woman complaining of a bad hangover.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie celebrates love, above anything else. It also displays the notion of regret, although the subtext is that people should make the most of life and take what opportunities they have. The benefits of communication -- be it through writing letters or through more modern means -- is also examined. Curiosity and perseverance are also clearly on display. Some infidelity.\n|Positive Role Models|: In flashbacks to the 1960s, society is portrayed as being dominated by men with women seen as second-class citizens. This is in contrast to the scenes set in the present day. For example, in the past, a controlling Laurence stops his wife Jennifer drinking. In the present, Ellie has agency over her own body, and decisions. Some characters have affairs. Laurence makes a waiter speak English rather than let him speak in his native tongue -- even in his own country.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A car accident occurs, though it's more dramatic than graphic. But someone involved is seen with blood on their face, and later it's learned they died in the crash. A husband gets rough with their wife, and threatens them in an intimidating way.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters have sex up against a wall in an empty room in a public venue. Characters discuss sex including one-night stands. Two characters are seen in bed together, seemingly naked under the sheets, having just had sex.\n|Language|: Several uses of the word \"f--k\" as well as \"s--t.\" The British slang term \"shagging\" is used when discussing sex.\n|Products & Purchases|: The characters are rich, and seem to enjoy spending their money on lavish things like sports cars.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters are seen smoking throughout, especially in the 1960s sequences, where they smoke at dinner tables, and in their work offices. Characters drink too, including downing alcohol and doing shots. One character is shown to be very drunk and another character discusses having a hangover.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770b431d95e001f1a7e1b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/last-night-in-soho", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Last Night in Soho is a British coming-of-age drama from writer-director Edgar Wright with horror elements, bloody violence, and strong language. It follows a present-day teenager, Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), who mysteriously travels back in time to 1966 London and ends up in the body of her singer idol, Sandy (Anya Taylor-Joy). Eloise and Sandy encounter a series of distasteful, unlikable people. Men lust after women, and seek to control and manipulate them. While girls from Eloise's college are bullies. The movie doesn't explicitly condone its strong and frequent violence -- there are various bloody murders -- but a blind eye is turned when it deems the victim deserving. Although not explicit, sex is frequently discussed and present, be it in London's sex shops or when a character is pressured into sleeping with people for money. In one scene, a woman is seen performing oral sex. There is much profanity, including two uses of \"c--t\" and multiple uses of \"f--k\" and \"whore.\" Characters drink and smoke throughout -- the latter mostly in the 1960s, depicting that era -- and there is occasional drug use. The cast is mainly White, but there is a person of color in a leading role, and the film has an empowering undercurrent, with two strong female leads at its center.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes around coming out of your shell and becoming your own person. Finding the strength to overcome a challenging time in your life. The film can be accused of condoning violence.\n|Positive Role Models|: Eloise is a strong-willed young woman, not bending to the expectations of society and embracing her unconventionality. However, the London she moves to is filled with seedy men and gossipy girls. Parallels are drawn to the 1960s where Sandie, despite her talent, is treated poorly. She is referred to as a \"creature\" and called \"blondie.\" Men are controlling and forceful. They imply that to make it in the entertainment industry, Sandie must \"play the game,\" as well as sleep with \"important\" people.\n|Diverse Representations|: The movie has an empowering feminist narrative, as the two leading characters -- both women -- are nuanced and well-rounded representations. This is despite all manner of sleazy, predatory, and inappropriate behavior from the men they encounter. There is a leading character of color, but the majority are White. In the scenes set in 1960s London, there is not much diversity in terms of race and ethnicity. But in the present day, there is greater representation.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are graphic scenes of violence, including sequences where men attack women, strangulation, and stabbings. Murders take place and there is much bloodshed. Characters have frightening and disturbing visions of ghosts, some intimidating, and some of a deceased parent. There are graphic suicide references. Characters engage in fist fights. Someone is run over and killed on the street with blood seen on the body. Characters also try to murder others with scissors, poison, and there's also the threat of a burning house. Character is pressured into having sex for money.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There is a brief sex scene, but no nudity on show. There is also a scene where it's clear a character is performing oral sex on someone. Couples are shown engaging in foreplay. A character is coerced into sleeping with a series of different people for money. There are sex shops on the street and a burlesque-style show in one sequence. There are naked, male ghosts.\n|Language|: There are two uses of the word \"c--t.\" Countless uses of the word \"f--k.\" There are derogatory terms used such as \"bitch,\" \"ho,\" \"slut,\" and \"whore.\" Also uses of the word \"s--t\" and a character is seeing doing an offensive hand gesture to another. \"Jesus/Jesus Christ,\" \"God,\"  and \"Oh my God\" used as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Characters are seen quite clearly drinking Coca-Cola and listening to music on famous, branded headphones.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Smoking and drinking throughout. A character gets a job in a pub, so naturally much alcohol is consumed there. Lots of characters smoke cigarettes, especially in sequences from the 1960s. A character in the present day is seen vaping. Characters do cocaine in the toilets at a nightclub. A character is seen injecting a substance -- believed to be heroin -- into their arm.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77686754c0f0001f307dd5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-last-song", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sweet-but-sad and fairly predictable coming-of-age story will likely appeal to hordes of Miley Cyrus' young fans, but it's best for older tweens and teens thanks to the heavy topics of divorce, abusive relationships, and death.

There's little swearing (\"bitch\") and some sexual banter, but most everything's pretty clean-cut.\n|Positive Messages|: Love transforms even the most hardened souls, though it\u2019s not always enough to sustain marriages.

There are references to lap dances, body parts, wet T-shirt contests, and long interludes in the hot tub. Elle's professor makes a pass at her. Elle's sorority life in California is all about mani-pedis, Prada shoes, and snagging the right guy. She decides to go to Harvard for the wrong reasons -- following a guy -- but she ultimately learns to value her brains, even if she continues to celebrate her successes with a shopping spree.

This movie has some sexual references, including a plot development involving gay dogs. While the movie is a comedy and ostensibly celebrates being true to who you are, there's also an element of both mockery of the \"ditzy blonde\" stereotype as well as the unnecessary social message, \"Attractive and materialistic sorority rich white girls with blonde hair who grew up in Bel Air are people too!\" Also, it could be interesting for some families to see how far our society has come in how homosexuality is regarded now compared to 2003, when it was still a punchline to have politicians and the media make a big deal about how two dogs are gay. Furthermore, the issue of animal testing in labs for cosmetics companies could have been addressed with a little more depth without sacrificing the overall comedy feel of the movie. Profanity includes \"kickass,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\" Reference made to a dog \"turning tricks\" on a Hollywood street corner to survive -- paired with the image of a dog standing behind a street corner card game. Oral sex insinuation. A cover of Maxim magazine, covering the lead character's crusade to stop lab testing on dogs, has the headline, \"Doing it doggie style.\"\n|Positive Messages|: No cosmetic is worth using if it was manufactured through the use of animal testing and cruelty. It's possible to be an airhead concerned with the latest handbags and shoes and brilliant at the same time. \"Why should someone else do for you what you could do for yourself?\" \"Never underestimate a girl with a French manicure and a Harvard law degree.\" Politics is a dirty business. One person can make a difference in the world.\n|Positive Role Models|: Elle is a self-sufficient, materialistic, overprivileged, loyal, animal-loving kewpie doll of a lawyer with a sunny and kind disposition and a go-getter work ethic. For comic effect, her character has been constructed to miss the most obvious sentiments of those around her, including their response to her odd personality. At the same time, in seeming contradiction, she is also supposedly capable of great strategic thinking, innovation, and eloquence. Her fianc\u00e9, Emmett, is supportive and encouraging. Her friends and sorority sisters will drop everything to help her in times of need. A congressional aide sets Elle up for humiliation. Elle rewards someone's selfishness with kindness and makes an ally. A conservative congressman lovingly accepts that his dog is gay. Elle's boss betrays her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's innuendo but no sex. Elle dresses in form-fitting outfits and shakes her hips as she toddles in stiletto heels but seems otherwise asexual, even when pecking her fianc\u00e9. They kiss after their wedding. Cheerleaders perform tame routines as congressmen ogle them. There's a reference to an orphaned dog \"turning tricks on Hollywood Boulevard.\" One office mate accuses another of getting her way by having her \"head in the lap\" of someone powerful. Elle cites the \"tongue or no tongue\" controversy that arose while setting up a kissing booth in high school. References are made to two male dogs having sex. A magazine cover layout shouts, \"Cleavage for a cause,\" but no cleavage is seen.\n|Language|: \"Kickass,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"hell.\" Reference made to a dog \"turning tricks\" on a Hollywood street corner to survive -- paired with the image of a dog standing behind a street corner card game.

Students on scholarship at a snooty Beverly Hills private school lie to cover up the facts of their economic situations, though only the nice characters are \"poor.\" Conspicuous consumption is stamped into every frame. Students sneak into a teacher's office, and eventually the teacher covers up for them.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie emphasizes that brains are as important as looks and reminds characters (and thus viewers) that it's more important to have true friends than \"cool\" ones. Private school students on scholarship are treated as second-class citizens by the school's mean kids in an obvious statement about skewed values, but when the villains get their comeuppance, what's their punishment? Enrollment in public school, which is presented as chaotic.\n|Positive Role Models|: The heroines of the story at first appear to be shallow and consumed with consumerism, but both show real tenacity and grit in solving their problems. To complement their shopaholic sides, they're shown studying hard and being proud of their scholastic records. The movie's main \"mean girl\" character is much less admirable, but she gets her comeuppance in the end.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting and crushes among teens.\n|Language|: One \"crap\" from teenage girls.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nonstop, as a signifier for the \"blonde\" mentality of these otherwise very smart girls.

The movie focuses on the conflict between a group of owls that considers themselves a master race entitled to enslave \"lower species\" of owls and the Guardians, a hidden group of warriors that fights to defend all owls from evil. With such a heavy plot and many action-packed battle sequences, this isn't age-appropriate for all young children. But kids old enough to read the books and mature enough to handle the themes will benefit from the movie's message that all owls (and therefore people) are worthy, not just those whom one group thinks are better than the rest. Note: The 3-D factor makes many of the movie's battle/fight scenes much more intense.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the importance of listening to historical stories and legends, as well as treating others like you'd want to be treated, regardless of their background. Obedience is called into question if it's to a suspect authority, so children may realize that it's sometimes the right thing to act against the rules. Kids interested in nature and animals will learn about a few different species of owls, particularly the Tyto and elf owl -- that they're nocturnal, live in different habitats, and expel pellets of their undigested food.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overall messages are positive, with the primary take-away being that believing in your dreams is what makes you strong and focused. Another positive message includes the idea that family and friends are more important than the promise of power and strength. The movie also demonstrates the power of myths, defending others, and and standing up to evil. The evil owls are very \"species-ist\" and think that other owl species are sub-par and meant to be enslaved -- but the Guardians see the worth and contribution of all owls.\n|Positive Role Models|: Soren is a strong positive role model: He's kind, selfless, and brave. He cares for his friends and family and believes the best of everyone. Gylfie is small but willing to fly away with Soren and later acts bravely despite her diminutive size. Ezylryb sagely explains that war isn't pretty and glorious -- that it's ugly and horrible and should be avoided if possible.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of animated violence, confrontations, and battles. The scenes with owl-to-owl combat are dark and often feature extreme slow-motion close-ups. Several owls die -- one falls into fire, and others are killed during combat. It's obvious that the owls are dead or injured, even if there's no blood. The 3-D makes the violence much more intense.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young male owl flirts with a female owl, and married owls embrace a couple of times.\n|Language|: \"Hell,\" plus some insulting, demeaning language about other owls, like \"you're weak,\" \"soft,\" \"old,\" \"what a waste,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b749ab544002150bae9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-lego-batman-movie", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that, like 2014's The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie is clever, creative, and funny, with nonstop action. It's a little darker/edgier than its predecessor -- there are tons of bad guys, battles, explosions, bombs, weapons, destruction, and general mayhem. But because it's all made out of Legos, there's zero gore, and very little is permanently damaged (lots of things are put back together in a literal snap). Still, the main characters are constantly in peril, which could upset some younger/more sensitive kids, and one key character momentarily seems headed for a more serious end. Words like \"butt,\" \"loser,\" and \"sucks\" are used, and there's a little flirting, plus humor related to Dick/Robin's preference to go without pants when wearing his costume -- but nothing gets too risque. Batman is forced to give himself a pretty hard look over the course of the movie, eventually realizing that he can't do everything by himself and that working with a team/having a family is more fun and fulfilling than going it alone (no matter how awesome your pecs are). As with all Lego movies, shows, and games, it also serves as a feature-length toy ad -- but you may not care, you'll be laughing so hard.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but does teach kids that it's important to admit when you need help and to connect with other people.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong, clear message that working as a team with people you care about and respect is better than trying to do everything yourself/alone. Thinking you're better than everyone else is bound to backfire (i.e. humility is important). Trying to avoid pain by refusing to make connections with others only hurts you more in the end.\n|Positive Role Models|: Batman starts out as a self-centered, egotistical vigilante who thinks he can do everything on his own (\"I don't need anyone,\" he says proudly); it takes most of the movie, but he eventually learns humility and the value of teamwork, family, and companionship. Barbara Gordon is a strong, smart female character who's tough but fair. Dick/Robin is an eager, optimistic kid; Alfred is endlessly patient and wants to help Batman/Bruce find the right path. The Joker is clearly a bad guy, but even he's made somewhat sympathetic by his desire to have Batman acknowledge their importance to each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A little darker/edgier in tone The Lego Movie. Tons of bad guys, battles, attacks, crashes, explosions, bombs, weapons (including various kinds of guns), fire, lava rivers, destruction, and general mayhem -- parts of Gotham City literally crumble to bits. Because it's all made out of Legos, there's zero gore, and very little is permanently damaged. But the main characters are constantly in danger, and one key character momentarily seems headed for a more serious end.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Batman gets a crush on Barbara Gordon at first sight; very mild flirting between them. Batman is proud of his chiseled pecs/physique. He's sometimes shown changing out of his batsuit/in his underwear, then wearing a chest-baring robe. Dick/Robin prefers not to wear pants with his costume (what's underneath is a thong-like strip). At least one over-kids'-heads joke related to Dick's name.\n|Language|: Some use of insult/potty words, including \"butt,\" \"stupid,\" \"loser,\" \"sucks,\" \"farts,\" \"shut up,\" etc. Also phrases like \"dear gosh,\" \"holy cow,\" \"what the heck,\" and \"oh em gosh,\" plus occasional British slang such as \"ruddy.\" Some jokes are made about Dick/Robin's name.\n|Products & Purchases|: Most of the characters have tie-ins to movie, comic, and book merchandise/franchises (including DC superheroes, Harry Potter, The Matrix, The Wizard of Oz, Lord of the Rings, and many more). Also appearances of/verbal references to brands/products including Vitamin Water, Google, iPhone, Bed Bath and Beyond, and romantic comedies like Serendipity and Jerry Maguire.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Reference to Alfred drinking wine.

Featuring an all-star voice cast and some of the brand's most popular figures (Batman, Superman, Gandalf, Wonder Woman, etc.), the inventive movie should appeal to all ages, from young Duplo players to teens who consider themselves Master Builders. Although there's nothing overly objectionable (a few mild exclamations like \"dang,\" \"heck,\" \"stupid,\" and \"darn\"), there's definitely a lot of action and peril, plus quite a bit of violence with the villain's security forces shooting at the good guys, and a character getting \"beheaded\" (since minifig heads pop off) or erased (with nail polish remover). Kids will love seeing some of their favorite minifigures come to life, but of course they'll probably ask for the tie-in Lego kits after the movie.\n|Educational Value|: This is an entertaining film not an educational one, but kids will still learn about various Lego characters, pieces, and instructions.\n|Positive Messages|: Though the message doesn't come until the end, the importance of play, creativity, and parent-child togetherness is a big takeaway. Also, that you can be extraordinary if you believe in yourself and take action. There are some deeper messages about how bland aspects of popular culture are, when everyone sees the same shows, listens to the same songs, and drinks the same expensive coffee. Teamwork is another positive theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Vitruvius guides and encourages Emmet and leads all of the Master Builders. Like many other reluctant heroes, Emmet is hesitant to believe he can do anything helpful until he believes in himself (but he's always really positive and upbeat). Wyldstyle learns to have confidence in Emmet and be herself, not just her persona as a tough girl.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots and lots of Lego action and peril, including gunfire and explosions; all are depicted with Lego pieces. Lego characters are \"beheaded,\" erased with nail-polish remover, super-glued in place, kidnapped, captured, and \"tortured\" (their minds are probed for building instructions).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Emmet has a crush on Wyldstyle, who is dating Batman. Some intense gazes are followed by hand (claw?) holding.\n|Language|: \"Dang it,\" \"darn,\" \"rubbish,\" \"what the heck,\" \"stupid,\" are all said infrequently.\n|Products & Purchases|: It's a movie about Lego characters, many of which are merchandise tie-ins to movies, comics, and books, like Batman, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Superman, Green Lantern, Han Solo, Lando, and Wonder Woman.

This time around, they're defending themselves from mysterious invaders who seem bent on destroying Bricksburg -- and then kidnap several of Emmet's best friends, including Lucy. So you can expect lots of action, including chases, fights, rescues, explosions, weapon use, dinosaurs, spaceship battles, and more. Since everything (and everyone) is made out of Lego bricks, the stakes never feel too intense -- but younger or more sensitive kids might be upset when sympathetic characters are in peril or argue with each other. Otherwise, content is quite mild, with a couple of uses of words like \"heck\" and \"butt\" and some flirting between characters (Batman also shows and sings about his pecs). And there are positive messages about perseverance, teamwork, friendship, cooperation, and loving people for who they are, not who you think they should be.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids will learn about various Lego characters, pieces, and instructions, and get lessons about cooperation and trust.\n|Positive Messages|: Cooperation, trust, friendship, teamwork are important to success, happiness. Don't try to change someone to be more like what you think they \"should\" be; love them for who they are. Never let a friend down. Siblings should find ways to play together rather than argue. Keep trying, even when it seems like you can't succeed. Togetherness is important part of Lego world.\n|Positive Role Models|: Emmet is (almost) unfailingly optimistic, upbeat; cares very much about his friends -- especially Lucy -- and wants to do what he thinks is best for them. Lucy learns that you don't have to be tough and brooding to succeed in hard circumstances. Batman discovers value of companionship, connection. Queen Watevra is manipulative, demanding, but also well intentioned. Rex has a big chip on his shoulder, for understandable reasons; he's also a blatantly macho stereotype (intentional, played for humor).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots and lots of Lego action and peril, including weapon use, explosions -- all depicted with Lego pieces. Lego characters are attacked, abandoned, imprisoned, \"re-educated\" (i.e., brainwashed), nearly pulled apart, etc. Spaceships fire deceptively cute explosives that decimate structures; \"master breakers\" can punch holes in just about anything. Characters are afraid of \"Armomageddon,\" which would mean end of their existence. In Apocalypsburg, characters have become hardened, Mad Max-style survivors; they fight, use chainsaws, etc. Emmet has a nightmare about his loved ones falling into a scary void. Unikitty turns into a monstrous cat when she gets angry. Arguments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lucy and Emmet continue to have a very close/special friendship. Queen Watevra decides that Batman will be her husband; a lavish wedding is planned, and she sings about the kind of guys she's into. Batman shows/sings about his pecs.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"heck,\" \"butt,\" and \"jerk.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: It's a movie about Lego/Duplo characters, many of which have franchise/merchandise tie-ins (DC superheroes, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc.).

While there's a fair bit of fighting/action (along the lines of earlier Lego movies), it's not constant -- and since it's meant to evoke how kids play with toys, it doesn't resemble anything realistic, whether it's kung fu-like scenes or blasters being fired. There's talk of parents breaking up, but no emotionally challenging moments related to the topic. While it's not the lightning in a bottle that The Lego Movie was, it will entertain adults nearly as much as it will younger audiences. As with all Lego movies, shows, and games, it also serves as a feature-length toy ad -- but you may not care because it's good fun.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids will learn a bit about Lego characters and pieces, as well as lessons about forgiveness.\n|Positive Messages|: The messages are positive but not deeply explored. There are clear themes of self-empowerment, forgiveness, and acceptance, plus reconciliation and prioritizing family.\n|Positive Role Models|: Good guys show courage in the face of long odds, and bad guys come around to see the light. There are two strong female characters, but they take a back seat to the males. Ethnicity/race isn't an issue, as the characters are Lego figures (though the voice cast is fairly diverse).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent but intentionally unrealistic fighting/action. Blasters are fired. One character loses an arm, but it's played for laughs, and because the characters are Lego figures, it's not a permanent loss. The action comes in set pieces that resemble kids' play, with nonspecific hits in the kung fu-like scenes and human sound effects for blasters (\"Pew! Pew! Pew!\").\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Some rude humor. Use of \"oh my gosh\" and \"what the heck.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: It doesn't get more product-placement-y than this.

There's a lot of shooting and fighting, as well as tons of swearing (with every word you can imagine in almost every scene), some drinking, and drug use (both pot and crystal meth). The violence is pretty realistic, and when people get shot or punched, it really hurts.  Characters also make sexual references, flirt, and kiss; in one scene, a woman takes off her top (she's shown from the back), and in another, an officer trying to apprehend a naked man ends up in close proximity to the man's genitals.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the over-the-top action/humor is the idea that it's important to be who you are and not to pretend to be something you aren't, a lesson the main characters eventually learn. And also, if you believe in your work, then be prepared to advocate for it.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ryan and Justin start the film as meek and somewhat ashamed for their lack or career success. Over the course of the movie, they learn to become more assertive and more comfortable with who they are. Of course, they get there by impersonating police officers, which isn't the best example, but it's played for laughs. The main female character is a love interest in need of rescue.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes show policemen and criminals engaged in shoot-outs, with many people injured or dead. Other scenes feature violent fist fights that leave combatants unconscious. One character is threatened with torture by someone who's prone to explosive moments (he head-butts his minions and gets into battles at the drop of a hat). Some mobsters show their contempt for others by spitting in their faces.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man and woman flirt with each other and later kiss passionately. In one scene, she takes off her top and tries to kiss him -- she's shown partially nude from behind. Another sequence includes a woman who aggressively comes on to two men, making a variety of crude and suggestive comments, though she's also quite awkward, and the scene is played more for laughs than raciness. Four police officers try to apprehend a very large, naked man and must tackle him. The scene leaves one character quite close to the man's genitals; much is made of how the proximity made him uncomfortable.\n|Language|: Heavy swearing in almost every scene, including \"f--k,\" \"d--k,\" \"p---y,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass\" and many, many permutations and variations.

During a courtroom scene, a tape recording presented as evidence plays a man and a woman having loud and passionate sex. There is frequent profanity, including \"s--t,\" and a series of euphemisms for sex. In an elevator, Fletcher makes suggestive comments about a woman's large breasts.

Despite his son's birthday wish that he has to be completely honest for one whole day actually working and the lead character learning valuable and worthwhile lessons on the importance of honesty, the over-the-top performance overshadows any lessons, thus not making him much of a role model.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character beats himself up quite violently. While in jail, the woman who bails out the lead character makes reference to sexual molestation in jail. Reckless driving.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A seduction scene, though without any nudity or actual sex. Sexual advances. An ex-husband asks his ex-wife questions about her sex life. During a court case, a tape recording presented as evidence plays a man and a woman having passionate sex. During this same court case, Jim Carrey's character throws out a series of euphemisms for sex. In an elevator, he makes suggestive comments about a woman's large breasts. At work, a coworker asks \"How's it hangin'?,\" and Carrey's character says, \"Short, shriveled, and a little to the left.\"\n|Language|: Frequent profanity: \"S--t,\" \"prick,\" \"d--k,\" \"bastard,\" \"d--khead,\" \"a--hole,\" \"jerk off.\" Middle-finger gesture.

Although there's no graphic depiction of sex, there are lots of references to sexual relationships, and Duhamel's character has one-night stands and casually makes out with several different women. Another scene includes heavy kissing and then shows two bodies in bed. Grown-ups drink at dinners, parties, and holidays, and in one scene Heigl's character is shown finishing off a bottle of wine. Marijuana is shown twice and eventually baked in brownies. Language includes \"a--hole,\" \"s--t,\" and \"bitch,\" and there are a surprising number of product placements (particularly household goods and cars), though they're just shown rather than mentioned. On the bright side, teens may learn a valuable lesson about the meaning of family.\n|Positive Messages|: Overall, the movie has positive messages about family and career balance, the sacrifices you make for unconditional friendship, and the importance of teamwork among parents. That said, there are some iffier messages earlier in the film about the way you handle sexual relationships (Messer is a love-'em-and-leave-'em type) and what attributes make women attractive to men (Messer calls Holly boring and predictable).\n|Positive Role Models|: Holly pursues professional success by working hard at her bakery and catering business. She accepts help from others but doesn't allow the men in her life to tell her what to do. She's also a caring and thoughtful caretaker who loves Sophie like a mother. Messer is ultimately a positive role model as well, but for the first half of the movie, he's an unrelenting, superficial jerk.\n|Violence & Scariness|: References to the car accident that kills Sophie's parents. Holly accidentally lets go of Messer's motorcycle, and it crashes into a bus. A few baby pratfalls played for humor.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many references to sex and sexual relationships. Messer is a \"player\" who's shown after a couple of one-night stands (the women are bare-shouldered in bed) and making out on many occasions, mostly in flashbacks. Two characters are shown kissing passionately, bumping into furniture, and tumbling into bed (sex is implied, with them in bed together afterward).\n|Language|: A few uses of \"s--t\" and \"a--hole,\" plus \"bitch,\" \"d--k,\" \"damn,\" \"laid,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Product placements in several scenes include: SmartCar, the Atlanta Hawks, Volkswagen Routan, Cuisinart, BMW, The Wiggles, Wonder Pets, Adidas, Whole Foods, and Kitchen-Aid.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In several scenes, the main characters drink beer or wine at dinners and parties. Holly drinks nearly an entire bottle of wine by herself. In one scene, a dad confiscates marijuana from three teenagers; in another sequence, Holly and Messer decide not to smoke the weed but instead bake it in brownies (and then eat them).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776bb37a53e9001e72dae3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/lights-out", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Lights Out is a horror movie about a ghost/monster that only appears in darkness. It's a surprisingly simple, effective idea that works well. Expect strong horror violence; in addition to scary stuff and shocking jump-scare moments, there's murder and death, bloody wounds, suicide, guns fired, brutally attacks, arguments, and unsettling themes. A young couple has a suggested sexual relationship, with some spoken references, but only kissing is shown. Language is infrequent but includes a use of \"f--k\" and some uses of \"s--t.\" A bong is shown in one shot, suggesting that a character smokes pot.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid all the scary/horror content, the movie does reward those who stick by their loved ones and face grave danger in order to protect them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although Rebecca is flawed and rebellious and is shown to be a somewhat unfit guardian for her younger brother, she's also very brave and loving and protective of him.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of scary, shocking moments. Characters are killed, and blood is spilled. Guns are fired; suicide by gunshot. A bloody leg. A mangled corpse. Character thrown across a room and hits her head on furniture. Character thrown from height.

The movie centers on a close-knit central duo who appreciate each other and their other (mostly female) friends. They show integrity, communication, and teamwork in their fight to keep both their relationship and their business on the rails. But there's no shortage of mature comedy: Characters share joints (including in a room where a baby is sleeping), joke about casual sex, and participate in dangerous stunts -- like one scene in which two women jump off a roof and into a pool and another in which a character dangles from a high building. A lingerie-clad woman climbs on top of her shirtless boyfriend to give him his \"birthday present,\" a woman implies that she ignores her boyfriend's talking in order to fantasize about him sexually, and a woman rudely dismisses a man from her house after a night of casual sex. Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" and more, and women call each other \"bitch\" on many occasions (perhaps a result of the movie being almost entirely made by men, whose take on female friendship isn't always accurate). The cast is diverse racially, ethnically, and in terms of body type.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of communication, teamwork, integrity are illustrated by movie's focus on living authentically and running a business that agrees with personal ethics. But female friendship is portrayed in a manner that doesn't ring true.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mel and Mia are close, supportive best friends who show their love for each other openly and often: \"You're my family, you're my home,\" says Mel to Mia. They treat each other with the utmost kindness and respect for the most part; when they err, they resolve to make changes: \"I'm going to do better,\" Mia promises Mel. Cast is diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, body type.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mia shows aggression toward Claire, threatening her with bodily harm and smashing a pane of glass with a hammer. Claire is left dangling from a high-up spot (from which she'd surely die if she fell), and Mia and Mel jump into a pool from a rooftop -- they make it, but if they hadn't, they would have been killed or grievously injured.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Jokes are raunchy. Some images of sex: a scene in which a lingerie-clad Mia climbs on top of her shirtless boyfriend and tells him to be quiet so he can get his \"birthday present\" (sex) faster. A woman talks dismissively about her much younger boyfriend, basically saying that she ignores him talking in order to fantasize about him sexually. Both Mia and Mel have men hanging around their kitchen in the morning; Mel is dismissive with her friend, directs him sternly to leave immediately, refusing to let him have her phone number (implying a casual hookup).\n|Language|: Language is frequent and crude: \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"p---y,\" \"coochie,\" \"hell,\" \"damn\" \"bad ass,\" \"oh my God.\" Women call each other a bitch on many occasions, including one in which a character purrs \"Thank you\" afterward.\n|Products & Purchases|: A character is told in one scene to \"take a Lyft.\"\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In several scenes, Mia and Mel smoke joints together, including one in which they realize there's a baby asleep in the room where they're smoking and then drop the joint into the crib.

Stitch (voiced by Chris Sanders), a small but powerful intergalactic creature, is destructive and angry; he bares his sharp teeth and angry attitude frequently, causing chaos and mayhem wherever he goes. As in many Disney stories, Lilo (Daveigh Chase) and her sister Nani (Tia Carrere) are orphans, grieving and struggling to adapt to life without their parents, though the circumstance of their parents' death (a car accident) is referenced only once. In a break from Disney tradition, there are no unredeemable villains: everyone ultimately learns important life lessons, including the heroes, who are far from perfect when the movie begins. Characters demonstrate compassion, courage, and perseverance.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Family ties can be formed under the most strained and difficult situations and can unite even angry, desperate, and otherwise abandoned people (and creatures). Trauma and grief, as well as resilience, are at the center of this film. A close, loving family is a source of great strength, and caring about others is a way to experience true happiness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lilo and her sister Nani are portrayed as strong and resilient, as well as capable of great mischief. Key characters, including Lilo, learn to channel aggression and anger in productive ways.\n|Diverse Representations|: Lilo and her sister Nani are both Native Hawaiians. Nani and David are both voiced by Hawaiian actors -- Tia Carrere, who is multiracial, and Jason Scott Lee, who has Native Hawaiian ancestry -- who helped shape the script to better reflect their experiences. Unlike many young female cartoon characters, Nani is drawn with a healthy body weight and proportions. The only Black character, social worker Cobra Bubbles, is slightly villainized: Concerned about Nani's ability to care for her sister, he threatens to remove Lilo from her custody. A non-traditional family unit eventually proves to be safe, secure, and loving.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of non-lethal cartoon action. On a distant planet, aliens/monsters are always ready to do battle: There are explosions, falls, armed conflict in space, shooting with lasers, stabbing with a needle, creatures held in glass cages, and an unintentional capture and imprisonment of a little girl. On Earth, a child punches and bites a classmate (but apologizes immediately after), a house blows up and falls apart, there's gunfire (by alien lasers), characters are dragged underwater, and there are frequent appearances by a destructive little monster with gnashing teeth and vicious behavior. The main characters' parents died in a car accident (a fact that is referenced once).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: David, Nani's coworker, is smitten with Nani and asks her out a few times. He's respectful and supportive of their friendship when she says no, even though she's also interested in him.\n|Language|: \"Butt\" is used, along with the angry gibberish Stitch uses as a stand-in for cursing.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684685719b001f3a6db3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/lilo-and-stitch-2-stitch-has-a-glitch", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this film contains a few scenes of fighting and mild violence, and that Stitch, when in the throes of his Glitch, may be frightening to young children.

He becomes involved with gangsters and loan sharks, which leads to plenty of violence, including shooting, stabbing, and blood. He also sleeps with many women, and there's language (including one \"f--k\" and a few \"s--t\"s) and frequent drinking. Although the movie is rated PG-13, the message -- that drugs can help you overcome problems related to confidence and motivation -- and the lack of consequences for most of the main character's drug-fueled decisions and actions make Limitless a very iffy choice for teens.\n|Positive Messages|: The main character becomes addicted to a drug that enhances his mental powers and makes him capable of solving any problem (and thus overcoming his lack of confidence and motivation). While on the drug, he accomplishes many things, but most of them are self-serving and based on greed and lust. He engages in destructive behavior with few or no consequences. At one point, his girlfriend argues that he hasn't actually accomplished anything on his own. The ending doesn't solve this problem.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character isn't a positive role model. He becomes addicted to a drug that enhances his mental powers and begins to lust for power and money. He's selfish, willing to step on anyone who gets in his way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence increasingly enters the main character's life as a result of the drug. He deals with gangsters and loan sharks, and there's some shooting and stabbing, dead bodies, and lots of blood (including one particularly gruesome moment in which the main character drinks blood). He makes a suicide attempt but backs off. In one scene, a man is blinded with a hypodermic needle. In another scene, a good character fights off a bad one by picking up a little girl wearing ice skates, flinging her feet in the villain's face, and using the blades on her feet to cut his face open.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character sleeps with many women during the course of the story, sometimes while he's in a relationship with his girlfriend. Viewers see kissing, fondling, and suggestions of sex.\n|Language|: Language isn't frequent but includes one \"f--k\" and a few uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"prick,\" \"bitch,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drugs are the main issue here -- NZT is fictitious, but it drives the movie's entire plot. The main character is clearly physically addicted to the pills and gets to the point at which he could die if he stopped taking them. The movie shows the excitement of the high as well as the horror of the crash, the sickness, the side-effects, etc. The movie even has different lighting schemes for the two states: bright and colorful for the high, and gray and drab for the crash.

The most disturbing violence is the death of Simba's father, Mufasa, by a stampede of wildebeests. The bloodthirsty hyenas, who scavenge for food and threaten Simba and his friends, are also frightening. But despite a few sad sequences and a few evil characters, the overall message is one of hope, love, and family responsibility. Note: The movie was rereleased in 3D in 2011, which added to the intensity of the more frightening scenes.\n|Educational Value|: This isn't an educational film, but it does provide many lessons about family and responsibility.\n|Positive Messages|: The Lion King focuses on the idea of family, love, and sacrifice. Mufasa's willingness to save Simba exhibits unconditional love. As Simba grows up, he comes to understand that he has a responsibility to his father's kingdom to take his place.\n|Positive Role Models|: Simba learns to face his problems and how to be a good leader. He demonstrates courage, perseverance, and humility. His parents are selfless and loving. Some have remarked that the hyenas' characterization brings some negative stereotypes to mind.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are some seriously scary scenes and bloody fights between animals. In one harrowing sequence, a father lion is trampled to death by a stampede of wildebeest after saving his cub. That parental death is a pivotal point in the movie, and it haunts the son throughout the second half of the film. Another lion is responsible for his brother's death and later tries to get rid of his nephew. A group of hyenas terrorizes two cubs and eventually acts as a scavenger army. A character is killed by hyenas, but viewers don't see the actual murder.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting between Simba and Nala, who are eventual mates.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: While there's no consumerism in the movie itself, this is one of Disney's biggest blockbusters and has myriad merchandise tie-ins, including video games, toys, straight-to-DVD sequels and even a Broadway musical.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c7f594b2b001e6f534d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-lion-king", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Lion King is an extremely realistic computer-animated remake of Disney's beloved 1994 original. Because of the realism (you'll likely forget you're not watching real animals some of the time), the violence is definitely more intense and potentially upsetting here than in the more cartoony classic. The insatiably hungry and scavenging hyenas, the terrifying and tear-jerking wildebeest stampede sequence (which ends in a tragic death), and the claw- and teeth-filled fight scenes are undeniably scary, even for those who know what to expect. That said, there's plenty of humor, too, including potty jokes from Pumbaa and Timon (the original movie's implied \"farted\" is said loud and proud in this version of the pair's \"Hakuna Matata\"). And it has clearly positive themes and messages: Parents and kids can discuss issues regarding family, friendship, loss, responsibility, and community. The all-star voice cast includes Donald Glover (adult Simba), Beyonc\u00e9 (adult Nala), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Scar), Seth Rogen (Pumbaa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and the venerable James Earl Jones reprising his inimitable role as King Mufasa.\n|Educational Value|: This isn't an educational film, but it does have lessons about honesty, communication, responsibility, and the individual versus the greater good.\n|Positive Messages|: Focuses on ideas of family, love, duty, sacrifice. Mufasa's willingness to save Simba exhibits unconditional love. As Simba grows up, he comes to understand that he has a responsibility to his father's kingdom to take his place. All living things are connected to each other and rely on each other; you have to respect the balance of nature and all of its creatures. It's perfectly natural to be scared; what matters is how you handle your fear. Courage, humility, perseverance are clear themes; Mufasa tells Simba that \"a true king's power is his compassion.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Mufasa is a wise, loving father and a caring leader who does his best to keep the pridelands safe and teach Simba about his responsibilities as his heir. Simba makes mistakes and acts impulsively (sometimes disobeying his father) but also learns to face his fears, tell the truth, and assume his responsibilities as a leader. He demonstrates courage, perseverance, and humility. Sarabi, his mother, is also selfless and loving. Nala is caring and a courageous lioness. Timon and Pumbaa are loyal friends who rise to the occasion despite their laid-back philosophy; Pumbaa refuses to tolerate bullies or let them make him feel bad about how he looks. Zazu is loyal. Scar is clearly a villain; he's selfish, deceitful, and manipulative.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frightening scenes include very lifelike scenes of animals hunting and fighting fiercely; key characters die. Realistic animation intensifies the violence, even for viewers familiar with story. Claws and teeth. Animals snarl at, attack one another. Potential spoiler alert for anyone who isn't familiar: In one particularly upsetting sequence, Mufasa is pushed off a ledge and then trampled to death by stampede of wildebeest; Simba screams in fear and sadness (scene is later revisited in flashback), later curls up by Mufasa's body. Hyenas chase, terrorize, try to kill two lion cubs, later fight with Mufasa, who injures, if not overtly kills, several hyenas. A lion and a herd of hyenas keep trying to kill a bird. Hyenas are depicted as snarling scavengers always ready to pounce. Simba falls over a cliff while being chased; the hyenas think he's dead (he's not). Vultures circle around a young, tired cub. Two lions fight nearly to the death. The hyenas jump on and kill a lion. Fire starts and spreads during the climactic battle scenes. The elephant graveyard is creepy and ominous. Scar has some blood on his fur while eating a kill.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nala and Simba fall in love as young adult lions. They're shown hugging and rubbing against/petting each other.\n|Language|: \"Farted,\" \"pathetic,\" \"that's insane,\" \"stupid,\" \"chubby,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement in the movie itself, but, as with all Disney films, there are plenty of off-screen merchandise tie-ins, including apparel, toys, games, fast-food figurines, even a Broadway musical.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768378a7581001f12d916": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-lion-king-1-12", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this movie has a surprising amount of potty humor--everything from Pumbaa's gas problem to jokes about belching, nose-picking and toilet-training.

After she's injured by a bully, 13-year-old Jordan (Marsai Martin) twists her parents' words of encouragement to understand that when she's an adult/boss, then she can be the bully. Unfortunately, that's likely the message that kids will take from the film, as well as the fact that adult CEO Jordan's (Regina Hall) meanness yields results: success, a lavish lifestyle, and submissive behavior from underlings. Meanwhile, the movie plays for laughs the shock of seeing a young teen treat people (both adults and other kids) like dirt, try to drink, and make sexual advances toward adult men (including her teacher). That said, some of the iffy stuff is written to go over kids' heads. Profanity is common but mild (\"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"hell\"), with stronger language only implied; sexual innuendo is frequent but subtle; and alcohol and drug references are ever present, but kids may only notice adults drinking wine socially. And Jordan doesn't really experience any big consequences for her behavior, which is likely why the film's intended message of staying true to yourself lands with little impact.\n|Positive Messages|: Key takeaways are that we know who we are when we're children, before the world beats us up, and that you should be true to yourself/not let anyone else define you. But those positive messages may be muted to kids, while iffier line uttered in beginning of film is more likely to stick: When you're the boss, no one bullies you, because you can bully them first.\n|Positive Role Models|: Two lead characters are black women: One started a successful tech company, one is a doormat; they're not ideal role model material. Black men are depicted as kind, thoughtful, compassionate. A teen girl is a science whiz. School chums are multiethnic.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of pushing and shoving, including a bully pushing a type of wrecking ball into a child, which causes injury. Comic spanking accompanied by line, \"Start spanking your kids!\" Talk about getting a belt to \"whoop\" a child.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Various scenes signal to adults that something sexual is happening, but they may go over kids' heads: A shirtless man dances provocatively (but not too suggestively) as a sexual mating call; a man serves coffee in the morning (adults will know he slept with the woman the night before); a teen girl comes on to her teacher; a teen girl touches an adult man inappropriately (viewers only know that from his reaction, and he never says what she did). Story told about woman losing her virginity. Women gesture to their genitals. Adults kiss. Young teen sings sultrily on top of a bar.\n|Language|: Language includes \"ass,\" \"balls,\" \"bitch,\" \"crackhead,\" \"crackbaby,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), \"we're screwed,\" \"stupid,\" \"sucks.\" A girl stops herself before completing the phrase \"what the f--k.\" Also lots of mean/insulting language, including adult woman name-calling a child to her face -- all played for laughs. Adult repeatedly tears down a 4-year-old girl's appearance.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands mentioned and logos displayed include Apple, Christian Mingle, Easy-Bake Oven, Honda, Fiat, Lyft, Postmates, Target, Tinder, Xanax, and TV series Empire. Jordan says that she can do/get away with anything because she's rich and insults another by calling them \"broke-ass.\" Success is equated with aspirational materialism, including expensive sports car, high-fashion wardrobe, closet that looks like a Rodeo Drive boutique.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Women drink as a way to let off steam/for romance.

Ursula the sea witch grows into a giant and wields a trident in a climatic scene. A bloodthirsty French chef merrily chases after Sebastian the crab with a cleaver, hoping to make him the main course. Romance is central to the story, with Ariel sacrificing everything, from her family to her voice, to (hopefully) be with the man she falls in love with at first glance. That aspect has long troubled some viewers. Ariel is a very popular Disney princess with a brand that reaches far and wide.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can try to name all the sea creatures -- crabs, oysters, dolphins, etc. -- when Sebastian sings \"Under the Sea.\" They can also look up the original (much darker) story by Hans Christian Andersen and decide which version they like better.\n|Positive Messages|: This movie places high value on romance and the concept of true love -- Ariel is so enamored with Prince Eric that she sacrifices everything, from her family to her voice, in order to be part of his world. Many think this storyline is problematic because it reinforces the idea that a woman should give up her pursuits and opinions in deference to a man. But others can put this concept aside to enjoy the sweetness of the central character and the universal challenges of love. Other themes include curiosity and perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ariel is adventuresome, rebellious, and brave. She also gives up everything -- her family, her home, her voice -- for love, even though her trust in the sea witch puts everyone she loves in danger. Eric doesn't show much of a personality. Sebastian is loyal and tries hard to help Ariel even though he doesn't agree with what she's doing. Ariel's father is protective and will do anything to help save his daughter.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Ariel's father is imprisoned by the cruel sea witch, Ursula, who also grows larger than a ship and tries to crush it wielding a giant trident. Ursula brags about all the mermaids she's imprisoned and those \"poor unfortunate souls\" are shown shrunken down and sad. A French chef runs around the kitchen after Sebastian the crab with a cleaver and merrily chops up other fish. Eric almost drowns when his ship sinks in stormy waters. Ursula dies rather dramatically in the end.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The entire movie revolves around Ariel's crush on Prince Eric and her desire to be with him. One sweet-natured song is all about getting a kiss out of Prince Eric.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Ariel is a very popular Disney princess, whose brand reaches far and wide, with princess branding on consumer merchandise, food products, etc. as well as in books, websites, and other media.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters handle a pipe.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776835103a2d001f567dcc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-little-mermaid-ii-return-to-the-sea", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that kids will see some potentially scary scenes with mild peril, including a pair of sharks who attempt to eat people and animal characters.

The scene is emotional -- King Triton and his daughters are scared, and Triton in particular is anguished -- but the event isn't explicit; only a boat and ocean waves are shown. The rest of the movie is very kid-friendly.\n|Positive Messages|: Ariel disobeys her father, but she ultimately proves to be wiser than he is -- she doesn't want to erase the memory of her mother or banish happiness from her life. Triton himself comes to see the light after years of mourning, over-protectiveness, and uncompromising sternness. The sisters are typical teens, fighting over hairbrushes, etc., but eventually they all make peace.

Instead, it focuses on a young girl who befriends the old man next door, who's actually the Aviator from the story. He tells her about how he met the Little Prince many years ago. The animated film takes plenty of liberties, but the basic message is the same as the book's, and it's an important one: Take time to enjoy life. That's an important theme for people of all ages, though The Little Prince has always been a fable that has more resonance for adults than little kids. Plus, the latter part of the movie has some surprisingly dark moments that may be a bit much for younger viewers -- for instance, when the Girl is trapped in a factory and threatened by the machinery (part of another character's plan to shut down her yearning for independence). There are references to/implications of both death and suicide. And the Girl has a complicated relationship with her mother.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include compassion, empathy, and integrity. A key take-away is that sometimes you have to let go of your schedule and your plans so you can enjoy being in the moment. In this busy, modern world, where kids are hyperscheduled and pressured from a young age, they sometimes don't get the chance to just be a kid -- which isn't good.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Aviator doesn't always follow the rules, and some of his schemes are downright dangerous, but his heart is in the right place, and his instincts for helping teach the Girl to find joy are spot on. And while the Mother clearly loves her daughter and wants only the best for her, some of her plans are stifling the Girl's spirit.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some parts of the film are surprisingly dark, as when the Girl is trapped in a factory and threatened by the machinery (part of another character's plan to shut down her yearning for independence).

There's some war violence, including images of war with dead men strewn about trenches and explosions in the background. Her father is presumed dead, and much of the movie concerns Sara's struggles as a now-destitute orphan. Sara is a remarkable character, however. She always sticks up for herself and others and captivates all the schoolgirls with her imaginative stories, and encourages them to believe in themselves as she tells them that \"all girls are princesses.\" Sara's retellings of the stories of Prince Rama and Princess Sita contain some monstrous imagery that might be scary for younger and more sensitive viewers. Some moments of bad behavior from little girls, including a girl who throws loud temper tantrums, and a snotty girl who acts superior and is shown dipping the hair of an unpopular girl into her ink well.\n|Positive Messages|: Tolerance of individual differences. Sara is accepting of everyone, including the \"nerdy\" girl at school, and she befriends the young black maid before she begins working with her. Sara also believes that \"all girls are princesses\" and repeats this phrase throughout the movie. Major themes include communication, compassion, empathy, and gratitude.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sara is kind and imaginative. She tries to befriend everyone in her school, including the \"nerdy\" girl and the black servant who's shunned by everyone else. She uses her imagination to cope with tremendous difficulties, including the perceived death of her father on a World War I battlefield and her subsequent descent into poverty.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Difficult loss of Sara's father.

Set in Civil War-era Massachusetts, the tween-friendly period drama is a tribute to sisterhood, generosity, the creative spirit, and the importance of community. Although the film provides a nonstandard framing device for the story, it mostly stays true to the source material. There are some sad/tense moments, particularly when one sister falls through the ice and (spoiler alert) when another one gets ill and dies in a tearjerking sequence. Mr. March is injured during the Civil War. The romantic storylines don't always follow the predictable route, but you can expect some kisses and longing looks and a cleavage-enhancing dress. Some characters drink -- one far more than he should -- and minor/background characters smoke. There's a reference to a \"cathouse.\" Although the story is set in a time when gender roles were more narrowly defined, the March sisters are all worthy role models, and their journeys demonstrate the core values they were taught by their parents. This touching adaptation could become a classic for a new generation.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages include idea that you should accept help because \"no one makes their way on their own,\" importance of overcoming obstacles, providing charity, offering forgiveness, writing from the heart, embracing talents and gifts, accepting differences, and celebrating sisterhood. Themes include compassion, empathy, and curiosity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Marmee is a steadfast, loving, thoughtful mother who appreciates her daughters' differences, fosters their individuality, settles disagreements. She's a role model of community-minded altruism and kindness. The March sisters are generous, loving, kind -- even though they're all (well, maybe not Beth) flawed and can be temporarily self-serving or vain. Laurie and the other men in their lives are all supportive, encouraging, respectful friends, partners, and suitors.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The girls encounter and help the sick Hummel family. Beth becomes dangerously ill with scarlet fever but recovers. (Spoiler alert: Years later, she dies.) Amy falls through ice while skating but is rescued. Amy comes home from school crying and with a welt on her hand because she was struck by her teacher. Mr. March comes home from the Civil War injured. Amy cruelly burns Jo's papers; upon discovering this, Jo grabs her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses, several longing looks, two proposals. Meg agrees to wear a cleavage-enhancing dress (behind her mother's back) at a party.\n|Language|: Aunt March insinuates that \"going on stage\" is the same as \"running a cathouse\" and that both are the only options left to unmarried women who want to be independent. Amy calls Jo's hair her \"one beauty.\" Insults \"savage,\" \"foolish,\" and \"selfish\" are used.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Meg drinks champagne at a party, as do other young women.

Lizzie also has a younger brother who wants his videos of Lizzie's humiliations to go viral online. There is some tween kissing, hand-holding, and flirting. Lizzie wears some skimpy clothing, especially when she nearly becomes a famous pop star in Italy.

A young girl is involved in the fights, and there's disturbing footage of children being mistreated in a laboratory setting. Suicide is considered. Language is also really salty, with many uses of \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" and more. A woman is shown topless, and the main character drinks frequently -- the possibility that he's an alcoholic (or a \"junkie\") is discussed. Despite the mature material, the movie -- which explores the importance of family -- is quite powerful and is a high point in the superhero genre. Expect teens to be very eager to see it.\n|Positive Messages|: Celebrates the virtues of having family vs. being alone, although it also explores how fragile family can be -- and how sometimes sacrifice is required.\n|Positive Role Models|: Logan is a very complex superhero; he's often very selfish and prone to iffy habits (drinking, etc.), but he occasionally drops his guard, showing loyalty and love and sacrificing himself for others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely violent fighting; characters die.

Only in Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski's take, Tonto (Johnny Depp) isn't merely a secondary character -- he's the story's guide, catalyst, and narrator. There's a surprising amount of violence -- not just the body count, but also persistent references to cannibalism (including a scene of a man's heart being cut out and eaten, albeit partially in shadow) and rape. (Some of the scary scenes are interrupted by flash-forwards, relieving the intensity, but things still get tense.) The language is mild, as is the sexuality (although one scene does take place in a brothel, and a supporting player is a madam), and the drinking is done by adults. A kid holds a gun to a man who's threatening his mother's life, and the lesson that sometimes the law can't provide true justice takes a bit of discussion. On the plus side, Depp has said he is in fact of Native American heritage and had the support of several Native American groups in his portrayal of Tonto.\n|Positive Messages|: The message is rather dubious, because the law doesn't necessarily provide true justice, so ultimately the Lone Ranger decides to work outside law enforcement. Tonto and John do form a brotherhood of sorts and, despite all their bickering, have each other's back again and again.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Reid brothers are both upstanding, moral men who believe in what they do: Dan as a Texas Ranger and John as an attorney and man of the law. Tonto is dedicating to righting the wrong that led to the deaths of so many of his tribe. He helps the Lone Ranger again and again, though they do work outside of standard channels/procedures. Rebecca, Dan's wife, is the opposite of a damsel in distress. She displays courage and bravery throughout the film.\n|Violence & Scariness|: More violence than you might expect, and some of it is pretty close up. Villain Butch Cavendish not only shoots people, but he's also known for eating their body parts. Audiences watch as he slices a man's stomach open and then holds his victim's heart in his hands. In silhouette, he's then shown eating the heart. There are lots of explosions, and the body count is quite high. A group of white (and one Mexican) outlaws dresses up like Native Americans and terrorizes people using arrows, burning down homes, etc. Butch's crew kills people -- usually with guns. The Army fights Native Americans, sparing no one. A woman is kept as a hostage and slapped/pushed/threatened. Butch alludes to rape when threatening her. Men are scalped and blown to pieces and drowned; horses are shot and killed in battle. A young man lies and says that Tonto and the Ranger threatened to \"violate\" him. A boy holds a gun on a man who's threatening his mother, and a boy is slapped in the face by a man. There's also a very startling scene in which seemingly cute bunnies turn ferocious.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses and a passionate embrace. A scene takes place in a brothel, but nothing too risque is shown other than women dressed in cleavage-baring corsets.\n|Language|: Native Americans are referred to as \"savages,\" \"Injuns,\" and \"heathens\"; other insults and exclamations include \"hell,\" \"harlot,\" \"damn,\" \"drunks,\" \"ass,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"idiot.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the movie, but there are plenty of off-screen endorsement deals, from LEGO sets targeted at kids 9+ to promotions at Subway restaurants.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink from jugs and wine glasses.

The main character has suggested sex with two women; one is shown topless, and there's also kissing and groping. Language is strong but infrequent and includes uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" Drugs are an issue; the main character is shown to be addicted to fictitious drugs, but his habit grows worse, and he's shown going through painful withdrawals. Characters learn to be less selfish, and there's a strong female lead.\n|Positive Messages|: The main character -- at two different ages -- begins the story by thinking entirely about himself. But by the end, he's learned to put others first. In a secondary theme, the movie asserts that a child will avoid growing up into an angry criminal if he can be raised by a loving parent.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the main character eventually does something heroic, he's actually fairly selfish throughout most of the film.

The main issue here is really the movie's huge number of consumerist tie-ins -- at least 70 different marketing promotions. For an anti-materialism story to advertise so many products to kids and their parents sends a particularly confusing message. Still, the movie itself -- like the original story -- promotes conservation and protecting the environment. Kids will leave the film wanting to do more to help the natural world ... too bad that take-away will be diluted by the onslaught of available merchandise with the Lorax's bright-orange image on it.\n|Educational Value|: The Lorax teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the natural world and protecting natural resources. The idea of \"unless\" is pivotal to the story -- that Earth will continue to be polluted and destroyed \"unless\" people like Ted and Audrey stand up for it.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the book, the movie promotes an environmental message about conservation along with themes of courage and integrity. It also suggests the danger of giving into materialistic impulses that can damage the environment. The movie will make kids think about where their stuff comes from, whether having too much stuff is a good thing, and what the consequences of their actions might be. Unfortunately kids may be confused by these positive messages once they realize how many product tie-ins are associated with the movie (see \"Consumerism\" section).\n|Positive Role Models|: At first Ted is driven purely by his feelings for Audrey, but then he decides to learn the story of the Lorax and the Truffula trees for himself and to help his entire town; ultimately he turns out to be a brave guy who stands up for what's right. The Once-ler redeems the greedy acts of his past. Audrey and Grandma subvert the conventional idea that having plastic trees -- plastic everything -- is better than real nature. On the negative side, the Once-ler breaks his promise and allows his family to convince him to chop down all the trees to make a profit.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Once-ler employs a huge machine attached to axes to chop down the Truffula trees. At one point, the Once-ler and a baby Barbaloot are floating on a mattress toward a waterfall, but neither is injured. A few characters are hit in the face with various objects (marshmallows, a hammer), but there's no lasting harm.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Ted has a crush on Audrey; at the end of the movie, they share a brief kiss. He also imagines kissing her earlier in the film.\n|Language|: Language includes \"stupid\" and \"dumb.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although the film (and story) itself espouses the same ecologically friendly themes as Dr. Seuss' book, the studio has agreed to more than 70 merchandise tie-ins, from the standard stuffed animals and figurines to the more egregious IHOP pancake platter and Mazda SUV promotions (the latter has included school events in which kids are urged to ask their parents to test-drive the vehicle). Many social critics have slammed the studio for taking Seuss' anti-consumerist message and turning it into an opportunity for the Lorax to promote various products.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768248a7581001f12bc70": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a classic fantasy that's full of violence and danger, including death. Horrific medieval-esque creatures kill, mostly with arrows and swords. More often, though, they get impaled, decapitated, dismemebered themselves. Middle-Earth characters drink beverages that are akin to wine and beer and smoke something called \"pipeweed.\" There's some don't-try-this-at-home playing around with fireworks.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong theme of the meekest, smallest folk -- personified by Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit -- becoming greatest heroes in a perilous quest. Gandalf advises Frodo against killing wantonly. Evil forces of Mordor and Saruman are associated with industrialization (more so in the followup The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers), whereas the Hobbit and mystic Elf races have more reverence for nature. Major themes include teamwork, perseverance, and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: The very innocence of Frodo, Samwise, and the other peace-loving hobbits becomes their strength, as greed and the temptation contained in the One Ring tear apart the alliance, preying on the allegedly stronger characters. Hobbits are still shown as mischief-making and fun-loving (and weed-smoking). Lust for power is said to be a particular flaw in the race called \"Man,\" though the long-lost King Aragorn is one noble warrior who does not succumb. Strong female characters are not too prominent in the Tolkien novel but get represented here (even if they are Elves, not humans).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Death and attempted murder by arrows and swords, including the agonizing killing of one character in a pincushion of arrows. People fall from great heights. Wizards batter each other bloody with invisible forces. A toothy, squid-like creature tries to eat the heroes. Supernatural creatures set on fire, impaled, decapitated and dismembered. Lots of gnarled skeletons and bodies showing signs of violent death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Topless female nude statuary is a barely noticed background feature of the architecture of Rivendell, the village of Elves.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Hard to ignore the original Tolkien books, not to mention a plethora of video games, movie tie-in action figures, role-playing games, plus the movie sequels and other existing adaptations.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Gandalf and Hobbits smoke \"pipeweed,\" a clearly enjoyable experience that makes playful smoke rings and figures.

Horses as well as elephant-like beasts are killed violently (sure, sure, they're CGI). There is quite a lot of glorification of bladed weaponry, as well as nightmarish imagery of ghoulish creatures, including a zombie-like ghost army and a hideous giant spider. Heroic characters smoke, drink, and get drunk. The story starts right where the previous Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers left off. Viewers not familiar with the first film (or J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) will be very confused. Not only is this Oscar winner a long movie, the DVD \"Special edition\" is even longer.\n|Positive Messages|: Powerful message of friendship among the Hobbits and the other allies (including different species). The seemingly meek Hobbits earn Middle-Earth-wide respect through battle and heroism. Theme throughout of sacrifice made in an immense struggle, including fighting against presumably impossible odds and overwhelming numbers, and trying to be brave against inevitable death. Additional themes include courage, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroes are valiant types who combat evil even when everything looks hopeless. A sword-wielding princess is a strong female warrior, even though males (like her kingly father) try to discourage her from fighting. On the other hand, there's a subplot acknowledgment that not all royalty behaves royally; an aristocratic regent mistreats his younger son to the point of nearly causing the character's death. And just as in the Tolkien novels, a foreign army who are the only nonwhite, non-Celtic-type races are on the side of the bad guys.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence is savage and intense for a PG-13. Thousands of creatures and humans are speared, slashed, hit fatally with arrows, crushed, decapitated, impaled on large spikes, and in the opening scene, painfully strangled to death. There's a catapult-shower of severed human heads, venom-stings from a monster spider, and characters burning to death. A key character's finger is bitten off.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild romance.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Hard to ignore the original Tolkien books, not to mention a plethora of video games, movie tie-in action figures, role-playing games, plus the movie sequels and other existing adaptations.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Joyous drinking to the point of inebriation in a celebration.

For all the monster gore, pet-loving kids may be most disturbed when a hungry creature tears up fresh-killed rabbits to eat. There is nightmarish imagery of ghoulish things, dead and alive, that may be too much for some. Once-heroic character smokes. The story starts right where the previous Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring left off. Viewers not familiar with the first film (or J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) will be very confused.\n|Positive Messages|: Theme throughout of sacrifice made in an immense struggle against evil; a tormented king must send his people to likely death in battle, including kids; Frodo must continue carrying the ring despite the pain it inflicts on him. Talk of mercy and compassion for the grotesque Gollum, understanding the creature despite his treachery. An immortal Elf princess considers choosing love over living forever. Evil forces of the dark wizards equated with industrialization, forest clear-cutting and mechanized development.\n|Positive Role Models|: The valor of kings, princes, and warriors are exalted, even little children who go to battle. Negotiating a peace, it's suggested, is for traitors and cowards, though this is an utterly evil, all-or-nothing enemy. The ring-obsessed, degraded creature Gollum is described as not beyond redemption (no other bad guys are given this courtesy). Characters demonstrate teamwork, perseverance, and courage.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Thousands of battle casualties in death by arrows, spears, and swords and one gigantic explosion. Threats of cannibalism. Orcs are dismembered and decapitated and, in once case, apparently devoured by other Orcs (with some gore). Gollum tears up freshly killed rabbits to eat.

With a theme of moving on after loss, it has strong messages about being the author of your own story and that life is \"sweeter after difficulty.\" While most of the violence is typical big-budget action fare, there's plenty of peril and one gruesome moment involving a shooting that appears to have been added for shock value (but ultimately has a reassuring resolution). Tatum's bare backside is seen extensively in a nonsexual scene that also has a lot of references to his penis (which isn't shown). Bullock's character writes steamy novels, so expect innuendo and racy language (\"d--k,\" \"s--t,\" etc.), as well as some creative writing tips -- e.g., a humorous dissertation on when the word \"throbbing\" can and can't be used. There's lots of product placement, particularly alcoholic beverages, which are poured and consumed throughout (villains also smoke cigars). Non-stereotypical portrayals include an intelligent romance novelist, a muscular model who's emotionally vulnerable, and a philosophical Navy SEAL who's into yoga. Although most characters of color are unfortunately portrayed as corrupt or unbalanced, supporting character Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) is a great role model: She's a successful Black businessperson who works hard, cares about profits and people, and establishes and maintains boundaries.\n|Positive Messages|: You are the author of your life story, so live life to the fullest. With a theme of moving on after loss, the message delivered several times is that life is \"sweeter after difficulty.\" Themes include courage, curiosity, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Loretta is a smart woman who incorporates her research on ancient cultures into her work. Alan is honest, courageous, and loyal and steps out of his comfort zone to help Loretta. While both Loretta and Alan are ill-equipped to survive a jungle, they work together to overcome obstacles. Beth is a successful boss who prioritizes people over profits.\n|Diverse Representations|: Non-stereotypical gender representation. Loretta is smart and values substance over surface. Alan is emotionally vulnerable, sensitive, humble. Less positively, his beauty routine is a source of humor; there are a couple of laughs based on his supposed lack of intelligence. But his overall depiction is meant to show that a person's relative braininess is just one characteristic in what makes them unique. Eloquent words are used to describe something some see as \"ugly\" (a skin condition that leads to insecurity) as beautiful. A tough Navy SEAL is also a Buddhist yoga practitioner who quotes Taoist philosophy. Successful Black female publisher Beth is a fully expressed supporting character who brings (a little) body diversity to the film. Most other characters of color are depicted as villains, corrupt, unbalanced, or smarmy.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One shocking, gruesome shooting with intense blood splatter (but no body shown on camera, and there's a positive resolution). Additional action violence is clearly choreographed to the point of hilarity, with punches, kicks, and knocking people out with hard objects. Villains are armed and shoot guns but mostly miss. Falls that likely result in death. Positive characters are constantly in deep peril, including trapped under water or in a fiery enclosure. Lots of talk about those who potentially die, acknowledging respect for the sanctity of life, even for those with evil intent.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kiss. A character is naked during a long, comical scene that shows his bare backside, with another character commenting extensively about the size of his penis (it's not shown). The main character is a romance novelist, and there's some innuendo and suggestiveness in regard to her writing. Some low-cut shirts. Romantic feelings.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"d--k,\" and \"s--t.\" \"Slut\" is used as a comical, misguided woman-to-woman term of endearment. \"Jesus Christ!\" said as an exclamation.\n|Products & Purchases|: Quite a few brands are notably displayed or mentioned, indicating product placement, including Fiji water, Jamba Juice, and a Ram truck. Positive characters drink alcohol with the label of the beverage clearly seen, including Don Julio and Stella Artois.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Villains smoke cigars. Drinking throughout, including tequila, whiskey, champagne, wine, and beer.

The film is not recommended for very young or sensitive kids. Dinosaurs, clearly motivated by a desire to protect their young and their environment, attack and often kill the humans whom they perceive as predators. Lengthy sequences of heroes in peril and animal brutality alternate with scenes that attempt to build character and relationships. Steven Spielberg shows some of the mayhem on camera (i.e., a heroic character is pulled apart by two dinos, then eaten); at other times, the director chooses to suggest the animals' savagery and plays it off camera (blood flows in water after a man is attacked). There are a few instances of mild swearing (\"bastards,\" \"s--t,\" \"goddamn\").\n|Positive Messages|: Primarily promotes the notion that man's interference with the natural order of the universe leads to destruction. Represented by corporate types, it's clear that men who are greedy, power-seeking, and have a desire to reign supreme over the earth will not survive. It's far more desirable to be compassionate, respectful, and nurturing to all species.\n|Positive Role Models|: The heroic characters (four men and one woman) are unfailingly courageous, smart, and diligent. They constantly put themselves at risk in order to save others. The female scientist (who is in danger almost continuously) rises to the occasion and proves as resourceful and brave as the others. Ethnic diversity is strong without comment. Bad guys fit the usual template of money-hungry corporate types who want to lay waste to the planet.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of thrills and animal savagery. The big game hunting and abuse of the dinosaurs is traumatic -- a baby dinosaur's leg is broken. Small dinosaurs (compies) swarm a little girl. Particularly gruesome scenes include: compies chewing at a villain's face before he is eventually killed; a raptor impaled on a spike; a severed hand hangs from a ship's wheel and an arm is seen holding a phone; a man is ripped in two by two T-Rexes. Dinosaurs chase, stomp, attack, and often eat their prey. Many long, suspenseful scenes in which the heroes, including a young girl, are in danger of being eaten, falling to their deaths, or crushed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Infrequent swearing (\"goddamn,\" \"bastard,\" \"s--t,\" \"son of-a bitch.\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Nikon.

It's a sweet coming-of-age story about courage, curiosity, and friendship -- specifically, that of Luca (voiced by Wonder's Jacob Tremblay) and Alberto (It's Jack Dylan Grazer). There's a bit of silly body humor (nose- and ear-picking) as well as occasional insults in both English and easily understandable Italian, like \"trash,\" \"stupido,\" \"idioti,\" and \"jerk.\" Physical comedy includes injuries from stunts like jumping off of cliffs and trees, riding a bike, and even getting in a tussle with another teen. Scared villagers wield spears and harpoons, and one even throws his at the main characters. Another character likes to use his big knife to chop up fish, much to Luca and Alberto's dismay. Parents and kids who watch together will be able to discuss the movie's appealing setting and its themes, particularly the importance of evaluating others for who they are, not because of their background or heritage.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn a bit about the deep, dark bottom of the ocean, as well as different astronomical facts.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages curiosity, empathy, perseverance, teamwork. Stresses importance of having dreams and goals, as well as a plan to make those dreams come true. Friendships and working together are major themes, as are being intellectually curious and wanting to learn as much as possible about the world. Another important message: not judging others for their background or heritage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Luca is curious, intelligent, kind. He wants to learn as much as he can about the surface and beyond. He makes some mistakes but atones for them. Alberto is courageous, as well as a bit reckless, but he's loyal to Luca. Giulia is clever, committed, smart. All the parents are loving. All characters are White/Italian; movie is set on Italian Riviera.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Physical comedy throughout includes characters lightly hurting themselves as they jump off cliffs, fall off bicycles, get attacked by a suspicious cat. One character pushes and punches another. In one sequence, a villager repeatedly throws a spear at Alberto and Luca; others threaten them, and they're the target of mean behavior.

Expect some gauzy love scenes (mostly kissing and early stage undressing -- no private parts are seen, though the top of a male backside is visible); infrequent swearing (\"s--t,\" etc.), some drinking by adults, some tense scenes of peril and confrontation, and jarring-but-not-graphic wartime scenes in which grenades explode and soldiers are shot dead. Although the movie means well overall, it does suggest that women need the love of a good man to be able to love themselves.\n|Positive Messages|: The Lucky One promotes the ideas that struggles don't have to define you and that you must learn to stand up for yourself. Also, that love heals,  that family bonds are very powerful, and that loyalty matters. But it also perpetuates the notion that women, no matter how capable, need the love of a good man to be able to love themselves.\n|Positive Role Models|: Almost all of the characters, even the one obviously pitched as the \"bad guy,\" have a soft side. Logan is kind, earnest, and principled, and -- despite some nightmares and sadness -- appears generally intact after the war. Beth is a caring mother and daughter.

A harrowing scene shows people about to fall into a raging river during a storm.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couples kiss passionately in the shower and in a bedroom while they remove each other's clothing (shot in close-ups that don't show private parts); sex is implied on more than one occasion.

The violence gets fairly graphic, with lots of shoot outs and blood splattering everywhere. The main female character is manhandled, punched, and kicked, and she also kills some bad guys without consequence. The plot concerns fictitious drugs and using drug mules to smuggle them, which requires some bloody operations to get them in and out of people's bellies. There are some quick documentary-like flashback scenes of sex between animals as well as between humans, and the main character sometimes wears sexy, objectifying outfits. Language isn't frequent but does contain at least two uses of \"s--t.\" Characters sometimes drink alcohol. It's all pretty intense, but the movie is so slick and thoughtful that teens may come away thinking about the ideas more than the iffy content.\n|Positive Messages|: Through its sci-fi concept (and in between fights, shoot outs, and chases), the movie makes several interesting, thoughtful pronouncements: that humans are currently more concerned with having than with being, that nothing ever truly dies, that ignorance creates chaos but knowledge does not, and that we as humans have the capability to change things.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lucy engages in brutal violence with no consequences, and no one in real life could emulate her. But she also has a strength and dedication that's inspiring in a female movie hero. And after she solves the immediate problem of her survival, she genuinely wishes to use her powers for good and for the future of mankind.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Strong fantasy violence, with lots of blood. Many characters are shot and killed, with blood splattering all over. Characters' hands and faces are covered in blood. Characters are used as drug mules, and the drugs are sewn up inside their intestines, requiring several bloody surgeries throughout the movie. Many chases and shoot outs with random death and destruction throughout. The main female character is grabbed, manhandled, punched, and kicked in several early scenes. She shoots and kills several bad guys without consequence. A character is stabbed in the hands with knives.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A documentary-type flashback shows animals having sex, followed by a woman having sex with a man in a car; nothing sensitive is shown, but what they're doing is clear enough. This is followed by images of birth, both animals and humans. The main character is sometimes sexualized through her outfits. In two instances, male characters place their hands down the front of her top. In one scene, Lucy, while fully clothed, spreads her legs apart to seduce a guard, though she quickly defeats him. Lucy kisses a helpful cop.\n|Language|: \"S--t\" is used twice. \"Ass,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"hell\" are also heard.\n|Products & Purchases|: A bottle of Evian water is used to clean a character's bloody hands. A Peugeot is driven during a car chase. Samsung products appear a few times.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Fictitious drugs and drug smuggling are a major part of the plot.

During the transition to the big screen, the creators have added tons of foul language (everything from \"f--k\" to plays on the word \"c--t\"), extreme violence (including blood splatter and throats ripped out by hand) played for laughs, and sexual behavior that include some nude male bottoms and some graphic sexual noises. The movie also includes a good deal of gay humor, such as a brief kissing scene between two men played for laughs, and a couple scenes where MacGruber graphically propositions other men as a misguided bargaining tool. It's one of those movies whose goal is to make the audience laugh through increasing levels of shock, rather than actual jokes.\n|Positive Messages|: MacGruber is not meant to be a message movie -- it's filled with crass humor, sex jokes, constant profanity, and non-stop violence. But it's all a big joke, so viewers are not meant to take it seriously. Also, MacGruber is on the side of the good guys, even if his motives are mostly personal.\n|Positive Role Models|: MacGruber is a flat-out terrible role model (though viewers would be hard-pressed to look to him as one). He exhibits endlessly stupid behavior, which is all part of his odd charm. He's not a team player, and often risks the lives of his teammates ahead of his own.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie is filled with gory violence, all played for humor. For example, MacGruber is an expert at ripping people's throats out, which he does, several times, with nothing left to the imagination. There are innumerable guns, bullets fired, and dead bodies. Blood is sprayed and smeared. There are explosions, with characters caught inside and burned. Vicki graphically digs a bullet out of MacGruber's thigh. A nuclear warhead is at the center of the plot.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The bottoms of two male characters are occasionally on display, and more than once with celery stalks sticking out. (The men are naked, but their genitals are not visible.) There are also two loud sex scenes, with no nudity (other than male hindquarters), but very graphic all the same. They involve graphic thrusting and language. Additionally, strong sexual language is heard throughout the movie, including a gay joke, reference to \"date rape,\" and MacGruber telling an explicit story about a college girlfriend. An older woman who is posing as an artist's model is seen partly naked (one breast exposed), and some sexy pictures are seen on a wall.\n|Language|: Extremely strong language is used throughout, starting with dozens of uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" as well as \"asshole,\" \"dick,\" \"vagina,\" \"God,\" \"Goddamn,\" \"bastard,\" \"retard,\" and \"butt.\" Characters are seen extending the middle finger. Additionally, the villain played by Val Kilmer is named \"Dieter Von Cunth,\" and characters get no end of enjoyment saying his last name again and again.\n|Products & Purchases|: Stuck in the 1980s, MacGruber drives a Mazda Miata and listens to a Blaupunkt stereo (the latter of which is mentioned by name several times). Several mentions of Molsen beer, Coors Light appears in one shot, as does Tazo tea.

It's extremely violent, with nonstop chase scenes, explosions, deaths, blood, shooting, and stabbing, as well as violence against women (including a bloody scene involving a pregnant woman), nightmarish flashbacks, diseased flesh, and other disturbing imagery. Several imprisoned women are attached to machines that pump their breast milk, and some of the female characters (some of whom are played by supermodels) are treated as sexual objects, shown wearing skimpy clothing while washing. One woman is naked, but viewers only see her behind. No strong language is clearly heard, but much of the dialogue is obscured by the thundering sound effects. Drinking, drugs, and smoking aren't issues. Even though this franchise hasn't had a new entry in more than a generation, it's likely that strong buzz will attract all kinds of teen moviegoers.\n|Positive Messages|: Selfishness and resource hoarding are clearly seen as \"bad guy\" behavior, while sharing and altruism are valued. Amid the violent action chaos, very different people learn to work together to achieve a common goal.\n|Positive Role Models|: Heroic characters learn to work together toward a common good, but their methods are questionable, and there's a lot of violence without consequences. Furiosa is a strong, independent, driven female character who hopes to free her fellow females from breeding slavery.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense, constant violence of all kinds, including against women. Characters die in explosions and car crashes and are shot and stabbed with arrows. A pregnant woman dies; the dead baby is cut from her womb (mostly off screen). Fighting, chasing. Nightmare sequences/flashbacks. Disturbing images. Diseased flesh. Blood transfusions.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several young \"wives\" are seen as sex symbols, wearing skimpy clothing and shown washing. A naked woman is used as bait; her bottom is shown.

The animals confront assorted dangerous situations, including an encounter with police, containment in crates (dark, closed spaces), a stormy sea and shipwreck, and, most alarmingly, a startling personality change in Alex, the lion, when he wants to eat his friends. There's a shooting with tranquilizer darts in which a character hallucinates to the tune of Sammy Davis Jr.'s song \"Candyman\" (younger viewers won't know this is about drugs, but the allusion is there). Gloria the hippo briefly appears with seaweed on her body, simulating \"pasties\" on breasts and crotch area. The lemurs are hunted by scary hyena-like creatures. A secondary plot has a crew of penguins acting like spies, which has them tunneling out of the zoo, knocking out a ship's captain, and stealing an ocean liner.\n|Educational Value|: Intended for entertainment, not education, but kids might pick up a bit about what kinds of animals live in Madagascar.\n|Positive Messages|: Overall the movie is about friendship and overcoming individual desires for the greater good. It's all very lighthearted, so the messages aren't going to make a huge impact here. Some conflicts and selfishness.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main characters are generally positive with exaggerated personalities for comic effect. Some of the humor relies of stereotypes -- a whiny hypochondriac, the fey king -- and soem characters are particularly sneaky and mischevious.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Fossas attack lemurs; lion attacks his friends, no explicit violence, but some startling imagery.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief shot of girl hippo pretending to wear \"pasties.\"\n|Language|: Words are suggested (\"dam\" used with \"Hoover,\" \"shh\" leading to \"sugar,\" etc.).

There's little questionable material here, although some parents may notice a couple of innuendos, some threats and dart-gun attacks, and one almost-curse word (\"Bolshevik\" is made to sound like \"bull---t\"). On the plus side, kids might learn a thing or two about the circus and European destinations like Paris, Rome, and Monte Carlo. As always, Madagascar 3 boils down to the central relationship between the four main zoo animals, and, like the others, the third movie makes sure kids know how important it is to have unconditional friends.\n|Educational Value|: Kids might pick up on some circus terminology, as well as well as familiarize themselves with the movie's locales in France, Monaco, and Rome. They'll also discover that Russians like borscht (although technically it's a Ukrainian dish) and that people go to Monte Carlo to gamble.\n|Positive Messages|: Several lessons about loyalty, friendship, what it means to be free, and not allowing past mistakes to get in the way of being bold and trying again.\n|Positive Role Models|: All of the animals (except for perhaps those pesky penguins) are positive role models, even with their (usually comic) flaws. They're incredibly dedicated to each other and overcome countless challenges to stay together.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mostly physical comedy and sight gags with the animals -- particularly King Julien and Sonya. The brawling dogs threaten people. The nefarious Captain Du Bois (who's bent on killing Alex as a trophy) isn't afraid of using her trusted dart gun or single-handedly putting three officers in the hospital. Several characters are hit with the dart tranquilizers, and eventually Captain Du Bois gets her comeuppance.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: King Julien falls in love with a bear whom he calls his \"big hairy beast\" and compliments on her fur. They're shown snuggling together, and there are a couple of innuendo-laden jokes that will go over kids' head. Gloria and Melman are together and hug a couple of times, and Alex and Gia flirt and eventually embrace.\n|Language|: Nothing inappropriate, but in one scene Vitaly says that's \"BULLshevik\" in a way that obviously mirrors how you'd say \"bulls--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: In the movie, a Ducati motorcycle receives a good bit of screen time.

There's also come crude/potty humor to watch out for, and an upsetting scene early on in which a young Alex is separated from his father against his will.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Lessons in being loyal to your friends dominate the plot. There's some crude/potty humor along the way (spitting, nose picking, etc.).\n|Positive Role Models|: Four friends drift apart after crash landing in Africa and must face -- and accept -- their own weaknesses. There are some challenging moments, as when Alex can't tell the difference between Marty and other zebras, but in the end, the characters do seem to find peace within themselves and in turn be better friends to others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few scenes may be a little disturbing for younger kids. There's a jarring plane crash that puts characters in peril, but no one is seriously hurt. An old lady gets into a physical fight with a lion, and the lion has no compunctions about hitting her back (both take some hard hits but come out OK). The same woman fights with other lions later. Guns are trained on animals, and there's a power struggle between two leaders on the savannah. A lion rite of passage involves a fight for dominance. Animals, including a main character, are shown in what are called \"dying holes\" when they are sick. One main character almost ends up in a volcanoful of hot lava (and another minor one eventually takes the plunge). A young Alex is separated from his father against his will in a scene that could be upsetting for some kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A hippo flirts strongly with another hippo, who tells her several times how much he likes her body. Some additional mild romance.\n|Language|: \"Stupid\" and \"butt\" are as salty as it gets.\n|Products & Purchases|: Mentions of an iPod and the New York Zoo, as well as references to being famous and catering to one's audience.

Although there's no complete \"full monty,\" every dance sequence includes the guys stripping down to tiny thongs that show their butts and highlight their genitals. In one scene, a penis is briefly pumped before a man goes on stage, and several sex scenes feature topless women. Language is also quite strong, with \"f--k\" used in almost every scene. There's also lots of drinking and some drug use; an underage character nearly dies from an overdose. And two henchmen rough up someone they're trying to intimidate. Bottom line? The amount of nudity, language, and substance use make this drama too mature for anyone under 17.\n|Positive Messages|: For a movie about strippers, there are plenty of messages about the nature of unconditional friendship and ambition, the importance of family, and the difference between who you are what you do for a living.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite his flaws, Mike looks out for his friends, works hard, and tries his best to make the most of his situation. He's also selfless and willing to bail out Adam, even though Adam definitely doesn't \"deserve\" the sacrifice. All of the Xquisite strippers are brotherly toward each other and help each other out when necessary. Brooke is the voice of reason who tries to convince Adam to get a normal day job and encourages Mike to take a close look at his dreams and whether he's actually going to achieve them by being a stripper.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A drug dealer's two henchmen ransack Mike's house and rough him up a bit. There's a disturbing scene when a guy looks like he might be dead (but he's just unconscious).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many scenes of nearly naked men performing stripteases. Most of the strip routines involve the men shedding down to a thong that shows off their butt and cups their penis. Several sex scenes feature topless women and men naked from behind. In one brief scene, part of a penis is shown in the foreground being \"pumped\" under the table before the character hits the stage (full \"side\" nudity rather than full \"frontal,\" basically).\n|Language|: Constant swearing -- the word \"f--k\" and its derivatives are used in nearly every scene.

All of the characters are over 21 except for Adam, who's 19. They drink cocktails, beer, and hard liquor and take (and sell) pills of Ecstasy and drink G (liquid Ecstasy).

Audiences will learn the reasons why the \"evil fairy\" (played by Angelina Jolie) is so bitter and resentful at not being invited to baby Aurora's welcoming party that she curses the infant princess. Far more so than the animated original (which itself is often too scary for younger kids in the preschool age bracket), this live-action version can get quite dark and may frighten younger kids, particularly during violent action sequences between the kingdom and the magical creatures of the moors. Characters die (or look dead) or are injured, and Maleficient is an intimidating figure. It's also very upsetting when her wings are cut off. But the movie's overall message -- about redemption and love -- is positive, and giving Maleficient more depth and context will help kids sympathize with her. As long as your kids can handle the battles, they'll probably enjoy this new take on a classic Disney villain.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the value of looking at a situation from more than one perspective, as well as the important lesson that people are often more than what they seem.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's over-arching message is to not allow greed and hatred to blind you from love and generosity. If Maleficent had let go of her anger at being jilted, she wouldn't have cursed Aurora, and if Stefan hadn't been so greedy and hurtful, the kingdom and the moors could have lived in peace. Aurora's journey is about staying in the light, even when surrounded by darkness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aurora is a sweet, kind girl who's curious and loves the creatures of the moors, just like young Maleficent, who was brave and protective of her fellow fairies and creatures. Maleficent is both a villain and a hero, because she had reasons to be bitter and unkind and is eventually remorseful for the hateful way she cursed baby Aurora. Against all odds, Maleficent is able to love again when she sees what a smart and generous young woman Aurora has become. Diaval is a loyal and truth-telling servant/helper to Maleficent.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie's tone becomes quite dark, and there are some genuinely jump-worthy/scary scenes -- like when Maleficent realizes that her wings have been cut off (a brutal scene that's reminiscent of sexual assault in some ways), as well as the various battles between the kingdom and the creatures of the moors, including the climactic fight between Maleficent, the king's guards, and the king himself. The three fairies can be physical with each other -- pulling one another's hair, hitting, and slapping -- but it's usually portrayed in a humorous manner. People die on and off camera, including one key character who plunges to his death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of kisses, including a romantic kiss between Aurora and a prince.\n|Language|: Rare uses of insult language like \"imbecile\" and \"idiot.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: While there are no product placements in the movie, there are promotional tie-ins to merchandise including apparel, toys, accessories, and games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c7ffb0d55001f5892d4": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/maleficent-mistress-of-evil", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is the even darker sequel to Maleficent, Disney's live-action retelling of Sleeping Beauty. After Aurora (Elle Fanning) becomes engaged to Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson), his mother, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), threatens not only Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) but all of the Moorfolk. The fantasy violence is more intense here than in the first film: Frightening sequences include war, mass destruction, and a near-genocide of the fae/fairy folk (think Avengers: Infinity War-like deaths). Characters are seriously injured, and one beloved character sacrifices herself. At one point it seems like no one will get to live, much less find a \"happily ever after.\" Characters drink wine, and romance includes a few kisses, embraces, and some longing looks -- but it's the love between mother and daughter that's really at the core of this story. Themes also include empathy, collaboration, and teamwork, as well as the possibility of reinvention and rediscovery.\n|Positive Messages|: Everyone is capable of change, and individuals don't have to play into their reputations or their darker natures. Reinvention and rediscovery are possible. On the other hand, Queen Ingrith's take on letting lies take hold until they're believed by a critical mass is negative -- but important. Empathy, collaboration, and teamwork are promoted.\n|Positive Role Models|: Maleficent loves Aurora and raises her to be queen of the Moors. Aurora is guileless and loves her godmother, her Moorfolk subjects, and her fianc\u00e9, who is a kind and generous young prince. Conall, like King John, believes in peace and in striving for coexistence, not war.\n|Violence & Scariness|: War between the fae and humans leads to mass destruction and near-genocide of fae via poisonous concoction that turns fae into dust (think Avengers: Infinity War) or lifeless plants. Humans also kill fae with iron-based weapons/arrows. Humans are captured in the faerie forest. Screams. One beloved character sacrifices herself for the good of the fae. Someone curses the king. Maleficent is grievously injured twice; once, she technically dies. Aurora is injured and hurt.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Aurora and Philip kiss and embrace several times. A powerful warrior fae smells Maleficent in what seems like a sensual way but it's repulsion at her scent of humans. Another dark fae saves Maleficent, carries her, looks at her lovingly, protects her. Two little fairy creatures hold hands, kiss on the cheek.\n|Language|: Snarky insults: \"You reek of humans,\" \"humans are hilarious,\" \"show them no mercy,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement in the movie, but there are off-screen promotional tie-ins to Maleficent-themed merchandise, including apparel, toys, accessories, and games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink wine in goblets at a meal.

It's extremely violent, with lots of blood, gore, carnage, fighting, spousal abuse, violence against women, and more. There's also guns and shooting, a murderous monster, twisted corpses, broken limbs, scenes of surgery, stabbing, blood spatters, jump scares, and references to rape and miscarriage. Strong language includes several uses of \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and more. Characters flirt a little, and a man says he's quit drinking. It all feels a little too familiar and often silly, but it's also over-the-top and has lots of style, as well as a fresh idea.\n|Positive Messages|: Though message doesn't manifest itself until the end, movie is essentially about standing up to a bully. This occurs in supernatural terms rather than real-world circumstances, but it's still satisfying.\n|Positive Role Models|: Two main characters are strong women: Madison is put in position of being a victim until the end, when she discovers her strength. Sydney is a selfless sister who goes out of her way (even snooping through creepy abandoned hospital) to help Madison. Police detectives are even fairly decent characters, despite occasional cynicism; they're shown as hard-working, sympathetic.\n|Diverse Representations|: The two main characters are White women. Sydney is a well-rounded character. Madison comes across as a victim for much of the movie but eventually finds her strength. The fourth major character, Detective Regina Moss, is a Black woman; she's a little cynical, but she's also decent, dedicated, has agency. A scene in prison is drawn from reductive \"women in prison\" stereotypes, with a butch lesbian, a Black woman with a giant Afro, etc.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely strong gore, with brutal murders, slashing and stabbing, huge blood spatters, bloody wounds, etc. Creepy stuff. Scenes of massive carnage. Murderous monster. A man smashes his wife's head up against a wall, cracking drywall and drawing blood. Characters are slammed against walls, floors.

It's very light on blood and gore, but there are lots of powerfully scary, spooky images, as well as scenes of young children in danger. Language is light (with one use of \"f--k\" and about three uses of \"s--t\"), and there's one brief scene of adult kissing and sensuality. Mama is a bit more ambitious than other horror films, and many horror-crazy teens will be able and eager to see it. But some of the movie's themes around motherhood and caring for children are a better fit for adult viewers.\n|Positive Messages|: Mama brings up some heavy, complex ideas about motherhood, fear, love, devotion, protectiveness, and selflessness. Some of the characters learn to change, opening their hearts and accepting new kinds of relationships.\n|Positive Role Models|: The girls' uncle is a selfless character who doesn't have much money but still wants to take care of his nieces. Annabel learns a great deal over the course of the movie, moving from being a very selfish person to a more giving and caring one.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many very spooky, creepy, and outright scary images, but very little actual blood. Children appear to be in danger in many scenes, especially a few early ones in which 1- and 3-year-old girls are with their panicked, unhinged father. (They survive a car wreck.) Secondary characters are killed, but only offscreen. A few semi-gory drawings are glimpsed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character and her boyfriend kiss and start to undress each other, but they're interrupted.

There's definitely a lot of violence (including a destroyed planet, necks being broken, hand-to-hand combat that results in deaths, and -- possible spoiler alert -- Superman actually killing an enemy), but it's more macro than micro in scale: buildings topple, the sea crashes down, planes plummet, etc. Language is infrequent but includes occasional use of \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" and \"ass.\" The romance even tamer: Lois Lane and Superman hold hands and kiss twice in one scene. Product placements are limited to IHOP, which is shown a few times, and Nikon (but there are more than 100 off-screen licensing deals/promotions in place globally for the movie). Expect plenty of messages about good and evil and identity and what it means to be a hero; ultimately this is a story about the duality of Superman's life (part Clark Kent, part Kal-El), as symbolized by his two fathers.\n|Positive Messages|: As is the case with most superhero movies, the underlying message is one of good versus evil, with Superman caught in the middle trying to decide how to navigate between his people by blood (the Kryptonians) and his people by circumstance (humans). The other main message is Superman's hero's journey of self discovery and acceptance of his power, his role and his responsibility to help and protect others. Another theme is preservation, whether it's self-preservation (Jonathan Kent thinks it's important for Clark to hide his powers lest he be manipulated by people and the government) or preservation of an entire race (Jor-El sends his baby son to Earth so he can be the best of both Krypton and his new home planet, and Zod is willing to eradicate humanity to see a new Krypton flourish).\n|Positive Role Models|: Clark/Kal-El/Superman is always selflessly willing to use his strength to save others, whether it's kids drowning on his school bus, strangers working on a burning oil rig, or Lois Lane being hurt by a Kryptonian robot. Even younger viewers will understand that this Superman is what his father Jor-El called the best of both Krypton and Earth. (That said -- possible spoiler alert! -- Superman does kill an enemy in this movie, which isn't typical for the character.) Both of Superman's fathers are wise and selfless. Jor-El guides his beloved Kal-El, even from beyond the grave. He encourages his son to use his superhuman gifts and strength to help humanity, not destroy it. Jonathan Kent reminds Clark to protect himself and not show off his strength until he feels the world is ready for him. Martha is a loving, unconditional mother who just wants whatever will keep Clark safe. Lois is a courageous investigative journalist who's willing to kill a story if it means helping Superman.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The mass destruction and collateral damage caused in the movie aren't shown in a close-up or bloody manner, but buildings collapse or burn down, cars are flattened, and helicopters and planes are downed. Both adults and children are frequently in peril. An entire planet is destroyed. General Zod and his army have no regard for human life and plan to kill off the entire species and repopulate earth with Kryptonians. Lots of almost too-fast-to-process hand-to-hand combat between Superman and Zod and his warriors -- necks are broken, and people are killed so quickly that it's hard to keep a body count. At one point, Martha Kent is nearly choked to death for information about Clark, which infuriates Superman. A final confrontation ends with Superman reluctantly breaking someone's neck.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lois and Clark hold hands, look longingly at each other, and share a couple of kisses.\n|Language|: Occasional language and insults include \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"d--k,\" \"a--wipe,\" \"d--ksplash,\" \"oh my God,\" \"damn,\" and \"crap.\" \"F-ing\" is said once, without the other letters filled in.\n|Products & Purchases|: IHOP restaurant is displayed prominently a few times: A character works there, the logo is shown (exterior and interior), and scenes are shot in the Smallville IHOP. Sears is also shown. Lois's DSLR camera, a Nikon D3 (a $10,000+ camera), is shown close-up in one sequence.

A few scenes involving mild peril -- like when a swarm of bees chase Pooh or when Rabbit is lost in the woods alone -- might frighten very sensitive children. A dream sequence involves Pooh getting pushed around a little bit and shot in the rear with a toy pop gun. Eeyore is famously depressed and self-critical. The movie provides opportunities to discuss different personality types and some iffy decisions that people (or imaginary animals) make.\n|Educational Value|: Unlike more recent Pooh spin-offs, this has a strong connection to the A.

The movie also shows a range of emotions that kids can relate to, like anxiety, fear, frustration, and pride. Additional themes include compassion, empathy, and integrity. On the down side, the movie does not encourage direct communication.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pooh is the central character and his joyfulness and simplicity is a rather realistic depiction of a young child, including the faults of overestimating oneself and going along with others on a not-so-good idea. The other characters are more complex -- grumpy, depressed, nervous, gregarious -- and provide good foils for Pooh.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tigger bounces on his friends and they don't usually like it. Pooh gets chased by bees. Several scenes show the animals in minor peril -- lost in the woods, stuck in a tree, etc. -- though the problem is always resolved. In one scene Pooh carries a pop-gun, and in another an elephant in Pooh's dream shoots him with a toy gun.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Pooh merchandise is everywhere.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e4d254aedf865003f94dfac": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-map-of-tiny-perfect-things", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Map of Tiny Perfect Things (based on a short story by Lev Grossman) takes on the now familiar idea of being stuck in time as the basis for a story about two teens falling in love. The bond that Mark (Kyle Allen) and Margaret (Kathryn Newton) share by being trapped in a time loop nurtures the development of a friendship and eventually deeper feelings. They eventually kiss, and a male friend talks about getting \"laid,\" but there's nothing more graphic in the film. In fact, Mark and Margaret come across as quite innocent and comfortable self-identifying as \"nerds,\" though they do drink a couple of beers in one scene, and she seems to have alcohol around in others. They model perseverance in trying to find meaning in their repeated day, and they learn the joys of being unselfish in loving others, especially their family members. Language includes \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"suck,\" \"loser,\" \"stupid,\" and \"crap.\" Mark dives off the roof of his house, knowing nothing will happen to him, and he and Margaret trash a show house just for fun, knowing it will all go back to normal the next day. A parent is dying of cancer.\n|Positive Messages|: Life is worth living, even it means we're moving closer to its end. Teens worry about their own futures as well as larger issues like climate change. We have to face losing our loved ones, or we risk losing ourselves too. It's important to think about others and try to understand what motivates them, rather than just judging them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mark valiantly faces being stuck in time; he does good deeds but also eventually sees what he's missing out on. Margaret doesn't want their endless day to end because she's avoiding what she knows will happen the next day. Both demonstrate perseverance in making the most of their repeated day and searching for meaning in it. Mark is inspired to make a map of all the perfect things that happen in the day. He learns to think of others. Margaret bravely faces letting go of a loved one. Girls excel at math, science, sports. No racial diversity within primary cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Margaret is learning to drive and crashes into things regularly. Mark dives off the roof of his house, knowing nothing will happen to him. The two trash a show house just for fun, knowing it will all go back to normal the next day. Mark falls off a skateboard and is taken to the hospital, where he gets a cast on his wrist. A parent is dying of cancer.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teens kiss.

While Marley's rambunctious antics will certainly amuse kids, there's some emotionally challenging material here. On the up side, there's not a lot of other problematic content; language is mild (\"ass\" and \"damn\") and sexuality is more implied than shown, though the characters do discuss topics like getting pregnant, and there's one nude swimming scene (but nothing much is on display).\n|Positive Messages|: Shows the challenges of caring for and training a high-maintenance pet and how it can bring out the worst in some people, but also how difficult situations can bring families together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sebastian is a womanizer, and he uses props to entice women whenever he can -- including using Marley as babe bait and even pushing a stroller over to a comely woman for attention. Marley can bring out less-than-honorable behavior in people. His misbehavior prompts John to call him \"the worst dog in the world\" and causes Jenny to demand that he be taken from the house and put in a shelter.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Marley's out-of-control behavior isn't violent, per se, but he wreaks havoc wherever he goes. A neighbor has been attacked in one scene -- viewers don't see the violence, but she suffers a knife wound, implying the violence that befell her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Though no sexual activity is explicitly shown, it's implied, especially in a creaky bed at an Irish inn. Content relating to reproduction (getting pregnant, miscarriage, birth control) might be too mature for younger viewers. Some shots of women in bikinis on the beach; a supporting character has lots of lecherous maneuverings. Jenny swims seductively in the nude, enticing John to collect his \"birthday present.\" Marley humps the dog trainer's leg.\n|Language|: Predictable for a dog-centric movie: \"crap\" and \"poop.\" Other language includes \"ass,\" \"damn,\" and \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Jenny and John pursue the American dream: a nice house in a good neighborhood, a nice car, a big trip, etc. But the pursuit is also a struggle, and viewers see how John and Jenny sacrifice to gain the material pleasure that they eventually achieve. Specific products/brands shown/mentioned include Volvo, the Philadelphia Enquirer and the New York Times.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: John mentions having taken bong hits in his youth.

Based on Bobby Crosby's graphic novel about a young, bubbly Britney Spears type, the story is transformed into a multicultural musical experience. Kat is engaged to Latino superstar Bastian (played by Latin music megastar Maluma), and the two often sing and speak Spanish. There are other non-lead characters of color, as well as LGBTQ+ and disability representation in supporting and background roles. Iffy content includes a few curses (\"ass,\" \"s--t\") and a non-detailed reference to the fact that Kat's previous marriage ended when her husband sold a sex tape. Characters kiss, and after six weeks of marriage, it's implied that a couple consummates their marriage, but nothing happens on camera. What may take viewers aback is the movie's enthusiastic embrace of consumerism; the film often feels like an advertising platform. Kat is a material girl living in a material world, and the product placement is blatant. Brands are everywhere: fashion, beer, iPhones, even a Vitamix blender that practically becomes a character. Producer/distributor NBCUniversal's shows and networks are featured to the point of obnoxiousness. And with Lopez only being shown in a glamorous and flattering light (other than Kat's preposterous decision being roundly mocked), it's clear that viewers are being sold on the star herself.\n|Positive Messages|: Several positive messages; the most repeated one is \"If you sit in the question long enough, the answer finds you\" (i.e., take your time and look inside yourself). Love is about sacrifice. If you want something different, you've got to do something different. Family is important; communication is key for healthy relationships. Social media is both a blessing and a curse.\n|Positive Role Models|: Charlie is humble, caring, invested in his daughter and students, not driven by fame/money. He's willing to sacrifice so that those he loves will thrive. Kat is a hardworking, successful, kind pop superstar who is reminded of what's really important through her experiences with Charlie. People around Kat aren't always sincere or honest.\n|Diverse Representations|: Two main characters are successful, aspirational Latino pop stars who frequently speak and sing in unsubtitled Spanish. Male lead is White; he has a biracial daughter from a previous relationship. Key supporting character is a lesbian, and a gay couple attends a school dance. Other supporting roles include people of color and someone who uses a wheelchair.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plot revolves around romance. It's implied that a married couple has sex; film cuts away from them kissing passionately to the next morning, with one partially clothed. Innuendo. References to infidelity. Music artist and dancers perform in tight clothes that suggest they're showing a lot of skin, but they really aren't. Reference to a sex tape without any details or images.\n|Language|: Language includes \"ass,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"s--t,\" and a couple of exclamations of \"Jesus!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Extremely obvious product placement, worked into the storyline, including fashion brands (Guess, Coach), jewelry (Pasquale Bruni), iPhone, Vitamix blender, web building service Wix.com (said with the \"dot-com\" so you don't miss it), and beer (Michelob Ultra). Most egregious is distributor NBCUniversal, which blatantly promotes its networks, shows, and studio. Central character is extremely wealthy, lives in luxury, and loves it; assistants do everything for her, and she gets whatever she needs by paying for it.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults are seen drinking and/or buying wine, champagne, and beer.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b0c9ab544002150686d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-martian", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Martian is a sci-fi space thriller based on Andy Weir's best-selling novel, a popular book among both adult and teen readers. Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut accidentally left behind on Mars when his crew thinks he died during an emergency evacuation. Expect some salty language (including \"f--k,\" which is somewhat understandable given Watney's dire circumstances), a quick glimpse of Damon's rail-thin naked body from behind, a gory moment when Watney has to deal with a serious wound, and tense moments of peril, including the initial wind storm that results in Watney getting knocked out and impaled, subsequent explosions, and other life-and-death situations. Despite the strong language, this is a compelling, diversely cast thriller for middle schoolers and up who are interested in space travel, science, technology, and, of course, science-fiction.\n|Positive Messages|: A tribute to the triumphs of science, teamwork, and the human spirit. Watney believes in his mind and what he knows about science to get him through each day and to keep him alive until NASA can send help. The NASA and JPL scientists and Chinese space program work together to help Watney. Courage and perseverance are important themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Watney is a stellar role model of perseverance and intelligence under unthinkable conditions. He never gives up, even when things look bleak; he always brainstorms until he finds a possible solution. Almost all of the astronauts and scientists are willing to put in extra hours, travel the globe, collaborate with others, and do whatever it takes to ensure Watney's survival. The characters are racially diverse and include strong women, although the gender split is less even than the ethnic/racial diversity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Perilous scenes of the Ares 3 crew's evacuation and when Watney is struck and vanishes. Later he has to remove a part that impaled him in the chest and staple the bloody wound shut. He survives again and again as things blow up and injure but don't kill him. His weight loss becomes startling by the end of the movie. Rescue scenes are scary and tense.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: It's not sexual, but there's one shot of Watney rail-thin and naked from behind.

Though the pace is rollicking and sometimes chaotic, there are no dangerous or dark elements. Melodic music, fancy dancing, and cartoon segments will engage even the youngest viewers. The father of the family is shown drinking brandy, but isn't drunk; minor characters smoke cigars.\n|Educational Value|: Some of the songs have phrases that have become mainstream lore, such as \"A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Themes include empathy and gratitude. Kindness to all people, whether rich or poor, is advocated. Also, the value of play, fun, and hard work is underscored by Poppins, as is the dignity and importance of children. A minor quibble: The fight for women's right to vote is shown in a somewhat frivolous light.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mary Poppins is mysterious, firm, kind, and caring. She's the very picture of an independent woman. She demonstrates compassion, communication skills, and integrity. Even without her magical ways, she's the perfect nanny.

As she did before, the flying, singing, lesson-imparting Mary arrives to help the Banks children -- this time, the three kids of a now grown-up Michael, whose wife died a year before the movie starts (he and the children speak and sing about missing her) and whose family home is in danger of repossession. The sequel departs from the original by adding a clear villain and a few scenes of peril/suspense (including a mostly animated but still tense chase through a dark wood), though nothing ever gets too scary. But it follows in the original's footsteps with its catchy songs and strong messages about imagination, gratitude, empathy, kindness, looking past the surface, and -- of course -- being close to your family and believing in yourself.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn a tiny bit about the impact of the Great Depression in the U.K. and how tough economic times can affect folks, as well as a little bit about why Aunt Jane advocates for the labor movement.\n|Positive Messages|: Mary uses daily obstacles and circumstances to teach the Banks children lessons about not judging a book by its cover -- whether it's an actual book or a person. Like original, it encourages empathy, gratitude, the value of imaginative play, fun, hard work. Mary Poppins underscores importance of children being children, adults embracing their childlike qualities. The songs' messages all build character -- e.g., embracing your imagination, looking at things from a different perspective, knowing that even in tough times, there's nowhere to go but up. Encourages strong family bonds, believing in your abilities.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mary Poppins is a woman of mystery, magic. She's loving, caring but also firm, with a dry sense of humor. She reaches each kid where that kid is. She's the very picture of an independent woman. She demonstrates compassion, communication skills,  integrity. Jack is positive, helpful, resourceful. Banks children are impulsive but want to help their father. Michael is overwhelmed by circumstances of his life but loves his kids, tries hard. Main bad guy is greedy, selfish but does seem to partially see the error of his ways. Diverse supporting cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The children's mother is dead; it happened a year before the movie begins, but they (and Michael) talk and sing about missing her. Potentially frightening scene in which young Georgie is taken captive by some ill-meaning animated animals; there's a tense carriage chase through a dark, creepy wood as his siblings try to rescue him. The kids go flying off \"the edge of the bowl\" and have to be rescued. Suspense when Jack climbs up Big Ben and briefly dangles high above the ground. A greedy man is mean to children, threatens them. Some yelling/harsh words between Michael and his kids. The Banks' neighbor regularly fires a cannon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of wink-wink double-meaning jokes/lyrics in a Vaudeville-like song-and-dance number (\"she only wore a smile -- plus two feathers and a leaf\") and a little hip-thrust dance move by Mary.

The movie has relatively mild levels of sex, drinking, and language, but the violence played for laughs could concern parents. A hit man threatens several people; in funny but still scary scenes, he chases after a character, then imprisons him in a bathroom and says he'll slit his throat. In other scenes, a severed human ear drops from a handkerchief the hit man holds, and he shows off a bag of bloody human teeth. Guns are pulled and fired. No one gets shot, but in one scene a man is afraid he's shot himself in the behind (a woman examines him and references his \"crack\"). Characters fight, and a woman defeats a rival by pouring vaginal itch cream in her mouth. Language includes \"ass,\" hell,\" \"t-ts,\" \"booty call,\" and more. One character is the butt of jokes based on her size, and a woman uses her sexual wiles to get a man to commit a crime. Characters who steal money get prison sentences, but one manages to hide some of his loot and isn't punished for it. Adults drink beer and cocktails; one character refers to being \"buzzed, not drunk.\"\n|Positive Messages|: There's a bit of a message about learning to be better friends, but there's also lots of irresponsible, over-the-top behavior. Crimes are punished with fair prison sentences, though it's implied that a criminal at least partially gets away with his crime. One character is the butt of jokes that focus on her size.\n|Positive Role Models|: David means well, but he ultimately makes poor decisions due to greed and lust; the fact that he hides some of his loot shows viewers that he's not sorry for his crime. Kelly and David learn how to be better friends to each other, but Kelly is also put in the cliched role of a temptress using her feminine wiles to lead a man astray.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence is mostly played for laughs, but there's a dark subplot about a hit man who goes after first David, then Kelly. He speaks about the thrill of killing others. A human ear drops from a handkerchief he holds, and he threatens to slit David's throat in a scary scene. Later, he shows a bloody bag of teeth from another victim. Men and women wrestle and scuffle. Guns are shown and fired, including one scene in which David almost shoots himself in the butt.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing, dating, flirting. A woman uses the promise of sex to get a man to do what she wants. A man about to go on what he thinks is a date uses talcum powder on his privates (a towel shields them from view). Crude references (to things like vaginal itch cream, etc.) and jokes about body parts: \"t-ts,\" \"crack.\" Prostitutes in skimpy clothing are seen briefly.\n|Language|: Infrequent strong language includes \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"t-ts,\" \"butthole,\" \"booty call.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A character buys a BMW, which is prominent in some scenes.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink beer and cocktails at parties and gatherings. \"I'm not drunk, I'm buzzed,\" one character says, to show he's in control.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f34f9d74e67002001fefc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/material-girls", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Material Girls makes some strange editorial choices, such as having one of the lead characters dress like a prostitute to get information, which lands her in jail with real prostitutes.

When Matilda's parents aren't neglecting her, they're berating her -- so she decides to punish them. But she also stands up for the principal's victims. The film explores themes of youthful independence and personal identity.\n|Positive Messages|: Though Matilda's decision to stand up for those who can't or won't stand up for themselves is admirable (as is her positive attitude), there's plenty of iffy stuff here. The movie is relatable for kids going through their own growing pains, but the fantasy-based nature of the way Matilda copes with her problems doesn't offer many realistic solutions for young viewers.

There are also gross elements, including an icky bug that enters the hero's body through his belly button and strong language (\"s--t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"crap,\" etc.).

It has intense and prolonged sci-fi violence and peril, including fights, car chases/crashes, guns, and martial arts. Characters are killed (sometimes more than once). There's some swearing (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"prick,\" \"damn,\" \"hell\") and a deeply romantic sexual encounter (briefly graphic, with breasts/butt exposed). Many characters are strong, brave, loyal, and intelligent.\n|Positive Messages|: The Matrix Reloaded explores the difference between destiny and choice and whether choice is \"an illusion created by those with power.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Morpheus is wise, and Neo is strong, brave, and caring, as is Trinity. Characters display great loyalty to their group and are highly motivated to save humanity from the machines.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Matrix Reloaded has many huge fight scenes-- especially ones with clones (Neo must fight 100 Smiths) -- zillions of explosions, and a 14-minute car chase and crash scene on a freeway, with bad guys who can turn themselves into ghost-like wraiths. The characters are constantly in extreme peril, some die, and one wounded character dies but is brought back to life.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some passionate kissing, one sexual encounter (not graphic) with partial nudity (her bare breasts, his butt).\n|Language|: Relatively infrequent use of words including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"prick,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" used as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: One adult character drinks wine.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e833ef0ec007c00413115b6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-matrix-resurrections", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Matrix Resurrections is the long-awaited (but underwhelming) fourth Matrix movie, the first since 2003's The Matrix Revolutions. Expect effects-heavy action violence, including lots of guns and shooting; fighting, kicking, and punching; bloody wounds (a throat is sliced, and a character spits blood); and explosions, chases, and unsettling \"dreamy\" visual effects (a man's mouth vanishes, etc.). Characters jump from high buildings, becoming \"human bombs\" and smashing into things below. People wake up partly naked in goop-filled chambers, but nothing explicit is shown. Language includes two uses of \"f--k,\" plus several uses of \"s--t\" and sporadic uses of other words. Main character Neo/Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) drinks clear liquor from a bottle, and other characters sip a martini or smoke cigarettes.\n|Positive Messages|: The Matrix movies offer plenty to think about, even if no conclusions are really drawn. The idea of some people being asleep inside an artificial reality while others are \"awake\" speaks to our turbulent times and can be interpreted many ways. The idea of choice is also important; each person must make their own choices. On the other hand, the characters choose to risk the lives of a civilization to save one person.\n|Positive Role Models|: Neo and Trinity are a little like superheroes, risking their lives and facing tough enemies to try to make the world a better place. They do cause quite a bit of chaos, but a lot of it is in the \"fake\" world, so it doesn't really matter much.\n|Diverse Representations|: While Neo's ethnicity isn't specificed, star Keanu Reeves is of English, Native Hawaiian, Chinese, Portugese, and Irish descent. He's surrounded by a diverse group of actors, including Morpheus, who's Black; Sati, who's Indian; and Bugs, who's of mixed Chinese and Zambian descent.

It has graphic torture-related violence, including a scene involving a masked woman trying to force a male prisoner to have sex with her. It also has punching, kicking, blood, bloody wounds, sleep deprivation, stress positions, and water torture. Language is strong and fairly frequent, with many uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. Characters smoke cigarettes and drink beer in social situations. It's a bit lifeless, but it gets its point across thanks to fine performances from the stars, including Rahim, Foster, and Benedict Cumberbatch.\n|Positive Messages|: Makes point that, in a huge, emotionally charged environment such as post-9/11 United States, it's difficult to know what the right thing is. At core of story are messages about dangers of revenge and mob mentality.\n|Positive Role Models|: Nancy Hollander is tough and serious; she pursues what she believes is right, even though she meets with resistance, challenges. Lt. Col. Stuart Couch turns out to be a decent person once he gives up on idea of revenge, starts to realize that there are other wrongs to be righted. After 9/11 attacks, members of U.S. government locked people up without fair trial or even humane treatment, mainly due to anger and emotion.

The movie, like the book, is a cross between Lord of the Flies, Ender's Game, and The Hunger Games and should appeal to fans of the books and of star Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf). There's more strong language (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch\") in the movie than in the book, which featured mostly made up curse words like \"shuck\" and \"klunk.\" Unlike many other popular teen movies, The Maze Runner doesn't highlight a central romance (at least in this installment), but it definitely includes the same amount of intense violence -- some of it teen on teen, some of it creature on teen, and much of it weapons based. Characters die, and the scenes in which the mechanized Grievers kill the boys are particularly disturbing. Main character Thomas is a strong role model, helping his friends and standing up to authority when necessary. And there are clear themes of teamwork, courage, and friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie encourages challenging authority and questioning complacency -- to take risks when necessary and to defend the powerless. Themes include courage, friendship, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Thomas is an exemplary role model because he's willing to risk his position in the group, his safety, and even his life to help lead the others out of the Maze. He makes friends and alliances easily and is able to stand up against authority, voice his doubts, and question why the boys have complacently remained in the Glade when they should have been searching for a way out of their imprisonment. Alby is a kind and generous leader who wants to do what's best for the members of the Glade, and Min-ho and Newt are both courageous and curious members of the group.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence is on par with the source books and similar YA-based dystopian thrillers. Teens rally together to kill huge, mechanized, spider-like monsters called Grievers. Characters die from being stung or otherwise killed by the Grievers; others die after being shot or speared, and a whole roomful of adults is found dead. The scenes of the Grievers killing the boys are particularly frightening and horrific.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Occasional language includes \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"bastards,\"  \"damn,\" and \"oh my God!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The guys in the Glade drink an unspecified drink that's strong and makes Thomas scrunch up his face, but it's unclear whether it's alcohol or not.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b9851dd69001fe31f5b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/maze-runner-the-death-cure", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Maze Runner: The Death Cure is the finale in the popular Maze Runner trilogy based on James Dashner's best-selling dystopian books. The movie centers on charming, loyal Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), who in this last film must rally the remaining Gladers to again rescue one of their own from WCKD's clutches. There's considerably more strong language in the movies than in the books: Expect to hear \"s--t,\" \"bull s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" etc. And the body count is high, with big explosions and shoot-outs responsible for lots of fatalities. But it's the up-close deaths (via stabbing, shooting, and falling from a great height) that are the most disturbing. Romance isn't a focus here, as it is in many other YA-based adaptations -- instead, the Maze Runner stories deal with friendship, teamwork, courage, and trust -- but there's a hint of a love triangle and a quick kiss or two.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the previous two, this is a story about teamwork, courage, friendship, and identity. The teen characters may not know their past, but they know they can trust one another and work together toward securing a better, safer future. The idea that even those without power and control can unite and resist those who are oppressing them is a key theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Thomas, Newt, Minho, Frypan, and the rest of the remaining Gladers are brave, clever, and selfless. They're willing to put themselves in dangerous situations and make sacrifices to defend and protect one another. While girls and women are somewhat scarce in this franchise, Brenda is a strong female character who isn't afraid to defend herself or protect her friends. Teresa atones for her past betrayals and does her best to make sure no one else is hurt. Jorge and Vince are older protectors and role models to the teens.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's a high body count: People die or are injured as the result of shoot-outs, assassination, and/or mass destruction, including explosions (one created by a suicide mission) and entire buildings falling. One character who's succumbing to a deadly virus asks to be killed and then has a knife fight with someone and ends up fatally wounded. A man with part of his face missing is shown several times. A couple of people who've been infested are shown transforming into zombie-like creatures. Someone plunges to their death after failing to hold on to an escape vehicle.

Based on James Dashner's best-selling dystopian young adult novel, the film should attract teens (and adults) who are familiar with book series, as well as fans of star Dylan O'Brien (MTV's Teen Wolf). As in the first film, violence is the main issue, with characters being chased, shot at, bitten by gruesome zombie-like creatures, and more. There's a high body count as the result of shoot-outs, explosions, and even a self-inflicted wound (the suicide happens off screen, but the shot is heard). This installment has more strong language (less \"shank\" and more \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"dumbass,\" etc.) than the previous movie, and there's also slightly more romance -- two characters even kiss (they're slightly drunk at the time) -- though it's not as prominent here as in the Divergent or The Hunger Games movies. Like the first movie, themes here include friendship, courage, and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a story about teamwork, friendship, courage, and identity. The teens may not know their past, but they work together toward a better future.\n|Positive Role Models|: Thomas, Newt, Minho, and the rest of the surviving Gladers are courageous, intelligent, and willing to make sacrifices to defend and protect one another. Brenda is a strong female character who isn't afraid to defend herself or her friends. Jorge seems selfish and morally ambiguous at first, but he saves the day when the chips are down.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The survivors face new enemies who use guns and tasers to subdue them. There's a high body count; people die or are injured as the result of shoot-outs (one person is brutally murdered at close range), explosions, and, in one case, a self-inflicted wound. The person who commits suicide does so off camera (the shot is heard but not seen), because they're succumbing to a deadly virus. A man is beaten so severely that his eye is bulged shut; he's bleeding and bruised. Characters are tortured (tied from their ankles and hung upside down). Gruesome, zombie-like creatures eat a rat, pursue anyone in their vicinity, and bite a couple of characters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A character turns another character's head away from watching someone who's changing clothes (viewers only see her arms in the air as she adds a layer). At a club, teens and young adults dance close together, and two slightly inebriated teens kiss.\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"bastard,\" \"dumbass,\" \"damn,\" \"what the hell,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), and \"oh my God!\" Also, one use of the middle finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene, two teens are forced to drink an Absinthe-looking liquor at a club where everyone is drinking; the drink makes them woozy and uninhibited.

Expect some swearing (including \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" and more, though not constantly), some drinking (sometimes to tipsiness), and racy content -- although there's nothing graphic, certain scenes feel very intimate, and there are some passionate kisses and references to sex and a woman's breasts/cleavage. While there are moments of levity and sweetness, the film's tone is a somber overall and sometimes downright tragic. The two main characters learn a lot from each other, especially about opening yourself up to different ways of thinking, but some viewers may find Will and his point of view problematic, since (spoiler alert) he feels that life isn't worth living if you're disabled.\n|Positive Messages|: You can't control what someone else does, thinks, or feels; you can simply love them and have compassion for them. Also: Make the most of your life, because it's the only one you've got.  Always be open to new experiences, and keep an open mind when dealing with difficult people. (Possible spoiler!) Will represents a view that life isn't worth living if you're disabled, which many find problematic and/or offensive. But Lou fights hard to promote the opposite message.\n|Positive Role Models|: Louisa is deeply empathetic and optimistic; she prefers to look on the bright side of life, even when it's actually dreary and tragic. Will, despite his melancholy and frequent rudeness, eventually opens himself up to friendship and love, though some viewers may (possible spoiler!) take issue with the fact that he believes that life isn't worth living if you're disabled. Lou and Will's parents' want what's best for their kids, and their love for them is clear. Patrick means well and comes off more sympathetically here than he did in the book.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man is hit by a motorcycle (the accident isn't shown but is heard). A glimpse of wrist scars hints at a suicide attempt. A main character frequently suffers illness and painful episodes. Some arguing/confrontation.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The movie opens with a couple in bed, kissing; his naked chest and her naked side are shown. A couple of other kisses, and a few allusions to sex (including non-disabled characters pondering the logistics of quadriplegic sex) and brief references to porn and a lap dance. Talk of a woman's form-fitting dress being \"too booby\"; a couple of other shots of/references to cleavage.

Mature humor includes crude jokes, sexual references, mentions of venereal disease, underage drinking, and comic violence. Teen girls call one another names like \"slut-faced ho bag,\" \"fugly slut,\" and \"nastiest skank bitch.\" The mother of one of the \"mean girls\" offers alcohol to her daughter and her friends, acts drunk, and offers condoms to her daughter when she walks in on her making out with a boy on her bed. The sex-ed teacher is revealed to be committing statutory rape with two students and is shown making out with a teen girl. Gay slurs are used. There's a prank involving a pregnancy test. Cady's home is taken over by partying teens while her parents are out of town. At the party, she gets drunk and throws up. A child watches Girls Gone Wild and imitates it. A girl refers to herself as \"half a virgin,\" and there's a joke about girl-girl kissing. A strength of the movie is its realistic portrayal of teen characters, including disabled, gay, and racially diverse students. Overall, it's a biting satire that doesn't shy away from some adults' hypocrisy and doesn't sugarcoat the language and behavior of teens when, mired in insecurity and feelings of inferiority, they spread terrible rumors and hurl insults, and it tries to use the story to combat and address this issue.\n|Positive Messages|: After rumors, name-calling, and the viciousness of the insults chronicled in a secret \"burn book\" culminate in high school hallways packed with students fighting, one of the teachers attempts to find ways to address the ugliness of cliques and name-calling among female students. After her role in the \"burn book,\" the lead character helps to make her school less cliquish, and has clearly learned from the mistakes she has made.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lead character learns to move beyond high school cliques and vicious name-calling, as well as her \"mean girl\" friends. Gay teen character presented as three-dimensional, not a stereotype or punchline. Nearly all of the adults aren't good role models: The mother of one teen girl offers her daughter and her friends alcohol, and offers her daughter condoms when she walks in on her about to have sex. The sex education teacher, a coach, commits statutory rape with two of his students. Other adults are clueless. One of the teachers initiates a discussion about name-calling and bullying among teen girls, clearly an attempt to convey a clear positive message amidst the comedy.\n|Diverse Representations|: One main character is queer and is depicted beyond simple stereotypes; someone mistakenly calls her \"Lebanese.\" The student body shows more diversity than most other teen comedies of its era, including nuanced portrayals of students of different races, body types, disabilities -- e.g., Asian students, both East and South Asian, are not limited to being quiet and nerdy. But there's some awkward sexualization of two female Asian students. In ending scenes, one popular girl, who is White, ends up in the \"Cool Asians\" clique and is seen speaking Vietnamese.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Character shown getting hit by a bus; wears a halo brace for the rest of the movie. Exaggerated fistfights break out in high school hallways after it's revealed which insults students have thrown at each other. Statutory rape: Sex education teacher revealed to be having consensual sex with two of his students and is shown making out with one of them.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Crude humor and references intended for comedic effect. Girls call one another names like \"slut\" and \"skank.\" When the mother of one of the \"mean girls\" walks in on her daughter and a boy kissing on a bed, she asks her whether she needs any condoms. The same mother has fake breasts; sight gags and verbal jokes are made about them. Humor in the misspelling of venereal diseases by the sex education teacher, who's later revealed to be having sex with two of his students and is shown making out with one of the students. A teen boy student asks a teen girl, \"Is your muffin buttered?\" Joke made referencing \"sexually active band geeks.\" A little girl is shown watching Girls Gone Wild on TV and imitates it.\n|Language|: Frequent profanity and name-calling. \"F---ing\" used once, \"f--k\" used in a soundtrack song. \"Motherf-----r\" almost said, but clearly implied. Gay slurs used. Put-downs on the order of \"slut-faced ho bag, nastiest skank bitch,\" \"fugly slut\" often used. \"Bitch\" used many times. \"Retarded\" used as an insult. \"A--hole.\" \"Damn.\" Character spoken of as being \"half a virgin.\" Teen boy asks teen girl, \"Is your muffin buttered?\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A lead character comes from a wealthy home because her father invented Toaster Strudel. Box of Dunkin' Donuts prominently featured in one scene.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Underage drinking: Teen throws a party that turns into a blowout; she drinks from a bowl of spiked punch and takes shots, acts very drunk, eventually throws up as a result. The mother of one of the teens enters with a tray of what looks like tropical cocktails, then offers to put booze in them for her daughter and her friends.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c0d7a53e9001e73819d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/meet-the-blacks", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Meet the Blacks is a spoof of The Purge horror series.

There are also scatological jokes, crass sexual references (including allusions to masturbation, premarital sex, adultery, stalking, and more), and pot smoking.\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of iffy stuff here, but there is the message that family should come first and that stepparents should get to know their stepchildren and vice-versa.

The cartoon violence is owed mostly to the movie's villains -- a robotic bowler hat and the mysterious mustachioed man who wears it. The Bowler Hat Guy suffers from severe jealousy and bitterness, which is why he wants to ruin Lewis' future. But the future, as it turns out, is bright for all, even Lewis' nemesis. Parents of adopted children may be especially concerned with the way the orphans and the adoption process are depicted.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn that they shouldn't give up on their dreams or let setbacks get them down. If you learn from your mistakes and keep trying, eventually your experiments will succeed.\n|Positive Messages|: On a positive note, a boy with every reason to be upset with the world learns to overcome challenges. The central family nurtures creativity and taking risks to follow your dreams. Some parents my be concerned with the sensitive themes of orphans/orphanages, adoption, loneliness and revenge, all of which are explored in the movie. Parents with adopted children may be especially put off with the way the orphans like Lewis are treated by prospective parents, and his thoughts that his biological mother did not love him.\n|Positive Role Models|: An orphan boy perseveres in the face of continued adversity. He also doesn't hold a grudge against a bitter former friend and invites him to join his family. An adversary discovers the meaning of friendship. A family is welcoming and encouraging, even when their relatives make mistakes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An ominous, robotic bowler hat wreaks havoc in the future, forcing humankind into subservience. Bowler Hat Guy creeps around trying to foil Lewis' plans. A T-rex attacks a family in a house, chases children and at one point picks up a boy with his mouth but eventually has to put him down. Various inventions explode, and a family has a big (humorous) food fight.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Young Lewis and Franny smile flirtatiously at each other.\n|Language|: Several mild taunts like \"booger breath,\" \"pukeface,\" \"butterfingers,\" \"stupid,\" \"geek,\" \"dumb\" and the like.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A boy drinks coffee to stay up, while an adult wears patches (reminiscent of nicotine patches) that make her act overly caffeinated.

Overall, the movie is age-appropriate for young grade-schoolers and up. There's one scene in which a character's supposed skeleton is shown and his death alleged, but other than that, the violence is all quite cartoonish and not particularly realistic or scary, and the 3-D isn't as intense as it is in some other animated movies. The language is also quite tame (\"butt\" and that sort of thing), but there's some romantic tension, and a couple holds hands, flirts, and eventually kisses. Most little kids won't understand the movie's general theme that good can't exist without evil and vice versa, but it's a fascinating concept to introduce to older children. Special note: Parents of younger kids should know that characters in the movie state that the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny don't exist.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the concept that where there is evil, \"good\" will rise up to face it and (hopefully) defeat it. Roxanne also asserts that it's not how someone looks that matters but the content of their character and their actions.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's primary message is that we all have a choice about how we act, and it is our actions, not our past, that determine what kind of person we are. The \"duality of man\" is also a major theme, as Megamind is both a hero and a villain throughout the film. The idea that good needs evil and vice versa is a sophisticated philosophical one, but it's handled in a child-friendly way throughout the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Roxanne is a positive role model -- she's brave, kind, funny, and willing to see Megamind's potential and not just all the awful things he's done in the past. (That said, he is a villain ...)\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence including explosions, the apparent death of a superhero, a glimpse of a skeleton, and several aerial battles.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Roxanne flirts with Metro Man and later both Megamind and his alter ego. They hold hands and hug, he carries her, and they eventually kiss. Before they get to know each other, Megamind calls Roxanne a \"temptress.\"\n|Language|: Some use of rude words/insults like \"butt,\" \"loser,\" and the like, plus \"oh God\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing notable in the movie, but there are off-screen tie-ins to fast food, candy, and other products.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f3504dfd128002089fe53": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/melody-time", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Melody Time is a 1948 Disney movie. The artistry and innovation of the Disney hand-drawn animation is on full display in the seven visual feasts that make up Melody Time, but they come with a warning from the streaming app Disney+ itself. It cautions that the 75-minute program \"may contain outdated cultural depictions.\" Those depictions include unprovoked violent mistreatment of Native Americans, referred to as war-paint-covered \"Indians\" and \"redskins\" here. For fun, a cowboy enjoys gleefully knocking into buffalo like they're football players on the opposing team. Mindless gun-slinging is applauded.

Scary creatures and life-threatening situations are frequent. The film, however, is as clever as it is exaggerated; some of the most destructive violence is implied, happening just off-camera. Still, young or sensitive kids who can't readily distinguish fantasy from reality may be disturbed by the barrage of exploding insects, grotesque morphing from human to alien life form, and cartoon violence (characters blow up, are vaporized, stabbed, shot with ray guns, and more).

Nothing is meant to be taken seriously, but rather to shock and awe the viewer with comic horror and laughter. Heads roll (literally), and there are explosions, crashes, stabbings, shootings, futuristic weapons. The \"ewww\" factor is high, as insects with massive tentacles capture humans; slimy creatures erupt into blue goo; a giant bug swallows one of the leads and spits him up later; a woman gives birth to a squid; a vacuum-hose is forced down a man's throat; bizarre-looking humans morph into all manner of even more bizarre creatures.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some mild innuendo and flirting between one of the heroes and the very attractive (and sexy) female coroner.\n|Language|: Frequent swearing and mild profanity: \"goddamn,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bastard,\" hell,\" \"butt,\" \"pissed off.\"  \"D--k\" and \"pr--k\" are used as insults.\n|Products & Purchases|: Marlboro cigarettes, Gold's Gym, Bloomingdale's, Ford.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A running joke shows a species of small, slimy, highly literate insects as heavy smokers.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d1851dd69001fe3fe4e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/men-in-black-ii", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this sequel to Men in Black is filled with imaginative creatures and weird life forms, the more outrageous and humorously creepy the better. Giant worms, multi-headed beings, slithering serpents, as well as humans morphing into all manner of the grotesque, battle or aid the heroes. Cartoon action is nonstop; weapons range from giant ray guns, vaporizing explosions, crashes, martial arts, even a near drowning in a toilet bowl. Other than the very young who are not yet able to distinguish reality from fantasy, or especially sensitive kids, most will experience the movie as a hilarious thrill ride. Some mild off-color dialogue and insults (\"putz,\" \"kiss my ass,\" \"crap,\" \"hell\"), some flirting, a kiss (which turns into an attack by snake tongue), as well as females who wear provocative bikini underwear in numerous scenes. Lots of commercial products are seen or mentioned.\n|Positive Messages|: Humans at their best are protectors of the Earth and can triumph over superpowered invaders from outer space (albeit often with the help of over-the-top weapons). And, as always in comic battles like this, teamwork matters, and the good guys (both human and alien) prevail.\n|Positive Role Models|: The members of the MIB agency are loyal, valiant, smart, strong, and male.

It serves as a kind of reboot, as it's the first film in the franchise without original stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones -- Thor: Ragnarok co-stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson take over as the leads. As is typical for the series, characters are often in peril, and there's a lot of over-the-top alien/sci-fi violence, including scary alien monsters, space guns and shooting (and some realistic guns, too), a scary melting face/body, punching, fighting, chases, and more. Expect brief, mild sexual innuendo (including a masturbation joke). Hemsworth's character wakes up in bed with a female alien; he removes her tentacled arm from his naked chest to get up. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"d--k,\" and a few other words.

The movie is packed with cartoon violence, including fist fights, sword battles, and one scene where Mickey seems to die from drowning. At one point, when Goofy is on the verge of being thrown into the ocean to die, a shot of many skeletons under the water appears. An underlying theme is the romance between Princess Minnie and Mickey the Musketeer. In the end, each of the musketeers finds love and exchanges several exaggerated kisses with his partner. The female characters are pretty helpless, and the movie revolves around saving and kidnapping the princess and her lady-in-waiting.\n|Educational Value|: There is potential to pique interest in the history of France and the original story of the Three Musketeers.\n|Positive Messages|: The primary message is the benefit of teamwork and loyalty -- \"all for one and one for all.\" Donald struggles with this idea because he's so fearful, but he ultimately makes the right choice to help his friends. The fact that Minnie is so helpless throughout the movie doesn't send a good message to kids about gender roles, especially because the idea of female helplessness is reinforced so frequently in mass media. Also, the focus on romance seems mildly inappropriate for the target age.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mickey Mouse is a good role model in that he is always optimistic, helpful, a hard worker, and a good friend. When Donald is struggling with his decision to leave the trio, Mickey encourages him and reminds him of the ways he has been brave. The other characters overcome their fears and insecurities to fight for what's right.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Packed with cartoon violence. No blood, but the quantity of smacks, punches, sword pokes, things falling on heads, extreme peril, and one scene where Mickey seems to die, makes this movie too violent for younger kids and likely to rile up older ones.

There's lots of kissing and a drunken hookup in a car, but nobody goes beyond \"first base.\" The main concern for most parents will likely be the teen drinking, which is handled somewhat irresponsibly. Teens drink a lot at a party (the main character has presumably never done this before), then drive around town -- all with no consequences. There's also a bit of language (including \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and \"damn\"), and the sole Asian character is portrayed stereotypically.

As you might expect from a war movie, there's pervasive conflict and violence, with many scenes of explosions, bombs, and sudden, violent deaths. The camera doesn't linger on bloody wounds, but you'll see many dead bodies, including some that are burned black. Characters also look swollen and bruised, and some are held captive; one is killed by being tied to an anchor and dumped off a ship. Expect lots of military guns, ships, and planes. Sexual content is limited to a few kisses between married couples and one reference to a soldier \"chasing tail.\" Frequent swearing includes \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" and more. Japanese people are consistently called \"Japs\" in a sneering tone, and at one point male soldiers are referred to as \"ladies\" as an insult. Characters smoke pipes, cigars, and, most often, cigarettes. Scenes take place at bars, with characters making toasts and sometimes getting drunk and lurching around. Both American and Japanese men are depicted sympathetically (women are barely present here), but there aren't many obvious role models, because most characters have very little screen time. A Japanese soldier's decision to go down with his ship seems to be viewed as honorable. Courage and teamwork are evident in the way soldiers on both sides unite for common goals. Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Nick Jonas, Luke Evans, Patrick Wilson, and more co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Courage and teamwork are evident in the way people pull together on both sides for a common goal. Parents may want to discuss with kids whether \"glory\" is really attained on the battlefield -- and if military might and conflicts can ever be positive things.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both American and Japanese sides of conflict are depicted sympathetically, which is relatively rare for American war movies. Most characters have too little screen time to come through as role models, but Admiral Nagumo emerges as an honorable man who unfortunately made decisions that compromised his side's goals. Movie seems to view his suicide, going down with his ship, as positive/honorable. Female characters are given very short shrift -- they're worried wives, period.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent war violence and near constant menace/danger. Many long battle scenes include aircraft engaging in battle and getting shot down, ships exploding, bombs falling. People die, sometimes in brutal ways: A character is tied to an anchor and thrown overboard, others are in planes that dive into the ocean or are set on fire.

Although no children are in peril in this installment of the franchise, the appeal of villains/bad guys is a central theme, and there are several scenes of cartoon violence that are played lightly/for laughs (explosions, freeze guns, torture devices). The actual \"body count\" is low and mostly involves the Minions' non-human/bad guy (a T-rex, a yeti, etc.) bosses. The Minions speak a made-up language, but there are a couple uses of insults like \"idiot\" or \"screwed up.\" And there are some glimpses of basically bare Minion bottom, as well as some other mildly suggestive scenes (implied nakedness after losing a swimsuit, bottom squeezing, a couple embracing, hypnotized guards stripping down to their boxers and dancing/slapping each other on the rear, etc.). One male character dresses as a woman, and at one point the Minions pile on top of each other to disguise themselves as a woman (earning a chest ogle in the process). Like the other Despicable Me movies, the story can be seen as a celebration of villainy (though much of it is intended to be silly/funny) -- but the long-term take away is hopefully more about how loyal the Minions are to one another and to their masters.\n|Educational Value|: Depicts dinosaurs and a few leaders throughout time -- like Napoleon and a young Queen Elizabeth II.\n|Positive Messages|: It's all intended to be funny/silly, but villainy is celebrated/frequently rewarded. That said, the Minions do exhibit/encourage loyalty and friendship.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although the Minions are drawn to villains (whose actions don't always have consequences), they're a loyal bunch, and they're good-natured and kind. Scarlett and her husband love each other very much (though they do cook up plots like stealing the crown jewels...).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Explosions, freeze guns, torture devices, scenes of various \"villains\" dying in mostly humorous ways -- like a T-rex falling in lava, a general being shot at, a yeti that's killed by an ice block, and several perilous/near-death experiences. A family of robbers uses paint guns to ward off the police (and a water tower is destroyed). One character is a weapons specialist.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Glimpses of bare/thonged Minion bottom. Three Tower of London guards are hypnotized to strip down to their boxers and dance/sing to the song \"Hair,\" slapping each other on the behind. Additional innuendo related to Minions cozying up to some fire hydrants, losing a bathing suit (and covering up with sea life), squeezing bottoms, and staring at the chest of a group of Minions disguised to look like a woman.\n|Language|: Infrequent insults: \"idiot,\" \"screwed it up,\" \"loser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although no products are featured in the movie, the Minions are hugely represented in tie-in merchandise including toys, apparel, games, food, and much more.

The Macy's brand is a big focus, as is Santa over more religious aspects of the holiday.

Her mother (Jennifer Garner), who faces a crisis of faith over the situation, fights fiercely for her daughter's survival; the movie focuses on the ways that such a situation can strain even the strongest family. Ultimately the message is that maintaining your faith that things will work out is both difficult and necessary. There's no drinking or sex and very little language (\"oh my God\" and \"sucks\" are about it), but characters argue and get very emotional, and some of the scenes featuring very sick children could be unsettling for younger viewers. One child is also involved in a serious accident late in the film.\n|Positive Messages|: It's easy to get discouraged in a crisis, but being able to believe that somehow things will work out for the best is critical. Family is more important than anything, and perseverance can pay off. If you're confident in what you believe, it doesn't matter whether others feel the same way. Perseverance and sacrifice pay off.\n|Positive Role Models|: Christy and her husband, Kevin, face a terrible situation and come through it stronger; ultimately the experience brings the entire family closer together. Christy is tireless in advocating for her daughter and helping her through her illness; Dr. Nurko is patient and upbeat with his young patients. Pastor Scott is supportive, accessible, and practical. Anna endures her illness better than you'd expect for a child of her age; she rarely gives into frustration or doubt (largely because of her faith). A few of the Beams' fellow churchgoers are portrayed as judgmental, but they're not meant to be sympathetic.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A young girl takes a fall while climbing a tree, potentially sustaining fatal injuries.

It definitely shares some of the book's complex content and themes, including death and the yearning to belong. That, plus the movie's overwhelming feeling of creepiness, make it too intense for younger kids. There are also battle scenes with weapons (explosives, arrows, and more), mayhem, and death. It's not especially gory, but the tone is pretty dark. There's talk of a dead child, and a key character is shown on the ground, bloodied and dead. The main character loses a family member. The evil characters are very menacing: They eat other creatures to survive, and characters are shown eating eyeballs. But running underneath the creepy stuff is the message that being different doesn't make you a misfit -- just unique and gifted in your own way. And characters demonstrate courage, curiosity, and integrity.\n|Positive Messages|: Being different doesn't make you a misfit -- just unique and gifted in your own way. Also, relationships between young people and their elderly relatives can be beautiful and character shaping. Themes include courage, curiosity, and integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jake is loyal to his grandfather and has a heart big enough -- and a mind open enough -- to be able to believe in things he can't quite explain. His grandfather is caring and conscientious and fosters curiosity and imagination in his grandson. Characters are brave and demonstrate integrity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very creepy tone throughout; many scenes have a sense of menace and foreboding. Opening sequence is quite scary, with a deadly attack and a boy fleeing through the woods. The main character loses a family member. The battle scenes between the Peculiars and the Hollows (who subsist on eating Peculiars and other beings) are pretty brutal, if light on blood. They use explosives, arrows, and anything lying around to fight each other. In one scene, characters eat eyeballs. A dead, bloodied man is shown lying on the ground, seemingly having been attacked by an otherworldly being. Talk of a dead child, his body lying in a room; like others who die in the movie, his eyes are hollowed out.

Starring the voices of Hugh Jackman, Zach Galifianakis, and Zoe Saldana, the movie -- which feels like a cross between a road trip comedy and a buddy adventure -- follows a 19th-century English adventurer (Jackman) who teams up with a lonely Bigfoot (Galifianakis) to find his distant relatives, the Yetis of the Himalayas. Expect some violent scenes in which guns are used, as well as a few character deaths (though they're all in the \"bad guy\" camp). One climactic sequence is particularly tense, as is a terrifying moment when a villain threatens a grandmother and her infant grandchild at gunpoint -- but (spoiler alert!) it all ends well for the main characters. Language is limited to \"bugger,\" \"sucks,\" and historical slang like \"poppycock.\" There's a bit of flirting but no actual romance, although there are references to Sir Lionel's rakish past. There are positive messages about friendship, identity, and partnership and themes of empathy and teamwork, but given the storyline and the humor, Missing Link is better suited for older elementary schoolers.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about friendship, identity, partnership. Shows why it's dangerous to want to preserve status quo and prevent change at all costs. Encourages people to put relationships, connections above aggrandizement and other selfish goals. Empathy, teamwork are prominent themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sir Lionel is a courageous adventurer. He's determined but also self-serving and glory-seeking. \"Susan\" is gentle, kind, searching for connection. Adelina is fearless and brave. She helps Lionel and Susan, and encourages Lionel to see how his actions affect others. She's far from helpless \"damsel in distress\" type expected in Victorian-era/westward-expansion-set stories.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mostly gun violence, since there's an assassin after Sir Lionel and Susan; later, Adelina brings her own weapons to fight back. Pub brawl includes guns, fists, and Susan's super strength, which makes people crash through walls. Several pursuits. Physical comedy: property destruction, falls, minor injuries -- e.g., Susan running through a wall, pushing people through buildings, Sir Lionel hitting instead of clearing a wall. A grandmother is threatened at gunpoint, her infant grandchild also. A character is accidentally pushed, nearly falls off boat. A few people die, including one who's more lackey than villain. Sir Lionel, Susan, and Adelina are pursued with spears, later thrown in pit that's seemingly impossible to escape. Loch Ness monster starts to swallow a man but doesn't kill him.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting between Lionel and Adelina, including a near kiss. While walking through a Western town, a woman throws Sir Lionel a kiss from a window; it makes her seem like a prostitute, but that will likely go over kids' heads.

There are some bloody visuals: clothes, hands, knifings, and a woman shot to death. Still, much of the violence is suggested rather than shown either using wide shots or with the camera cutting away before a grisly death actually happens. Adventurous stunts include daring fights and chases along with explosions, flooding, crashes through glass, a helicopter in pursuit of a high speed train with men fighting atop it, and a death-defying burglary of an impregnable security installation. The film contains occasional mild cursing, some smoking and drinking, a few drugs administered to subdue those who may be a threat, and a hint of a possible sexual indiscretion.\n|Positive Messages|: In the fight between good and evil, honesty, integrity and bravery prevail. While trust is fragile and precious, even the most steadfast of allies may be corruptible.\n|Positive Role Models|: The dashing hero is willing to risk his career, his good name, and his life to uncover treachery and obtain justice for his fallen friends. He is unrelenting in his honesty, his loyalty, and his service to his country. His superiors in the IMF seem slow-witted and inefficient much of the time.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent action and lots of suspense. A series of attacks finds a team of agents killed early in the film by: a rigged elevator, a gunshot and fall from a bridge, a double knifing, and an exploding car. A restaurant is blown up and flooded; a man crashes through a window and escapes. There are numerous fights, which include punches, slaps to the head, knife fights, and gunfire (one woman is shot to death). A lengthy final sequence takes place atop a speeding train, with a helicopter chasing it and includes men jumping, falling, sliding, and hanging over the side of the train. There are some brief bloody images (hands, shirt, clothes), but in most instances deaths happen just after the camera cuts away or in wide shots, and are not graphic or gruesome.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An agent pats down a woman suspect, briefly touches her breasts.

It steps up the action from previous entries in the series, which is quite a feat. The vehicle chases are much more intense than in previous episodes, and the fighting feels more visceral; blows look like they actually hurt. There are also shootings, knife fights, and deaths, but blood is rare (typical for these movies). And there's still humor; the movie doesn't feel slow or heavy, despite its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time. Expect a bit of strong language (\"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" etc., plus one use of \"f---ing\"), but there's not much in the way of sex or substance use content to worry about. Main character Ethan Hunt (Cruise) remains a stand-up guy in a world full of betrayal; in general, the good guys are consistently willing to sacrifice themselves to save others. Henry Cavill and Rebecca Ferguson co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Plenty of the usual spy-movie betrayals and killings, but the good guys are consistently willing to sacrifice themselves to save others. Also a theme of valuing not only many lives, but also individual ones -- and not hurting others unless you absolutely have to.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ethan Hunt operates in a world of violence and destruction but always tries to do the right thing, is brave and self-sacrificing. He cares about his team. The female characters are highly capable and brave; Erika Sloane is in a position of significant power (deputy director of the CIA), and Ilsa is core to the story.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many intense action-movie stunts with unrealistic outcomes (for example, a character is thrown from a motorcycle at high speed without a helmet, rolls a few times, and is OK). The action is stepped up from previous chapters in the already famously stunt-heavy franchise, with more intense hand-to-hand combat and vehicle chases (cars, motorcycles, helicopters, etc.). Blood is rare, but a character does get a disfiguring burn/wound. Shootings, knife fights, frequent peril. Deaths. A confusing bathroom situation could come across as a potential incident of violent gay-bashing that's thankfully nipped in the bud.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One unexpected kiss. Suggestive comments about men who are locked in a bathroom stall together.\n|Language|: Infrequent strong language includes one use of \"f---ing,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"pr--k,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" (as an exclamation).

Expect tons of thrilling-but-violent action sequences, including assassinations and weapons that maim, bomb, and kill. The body count definitely adds up, but blood is minimal. There's also some swearing (including \"s--t\"), as well as some kissing and flirting, social drinking, and smoking.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a pretty straightforward good-versus-evil story. Teamwork is what really makes Ethan's team successful; they all watch one another's back and are loyal to the group. Another notable takeaway: Gadgets can fail, so human relationships and resourcefulness matter more.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ethan is definitively on the \"good\" side, though there are allusions to him having gone off-mission and killed six men.

Swearing is infrequent, though \"s--t\" is used, and there's not much in the way of drinking/drugs (a bit of social drinking by adults). Some partial nudity; there's a bare back of a woman with a partial view of her breast.

In both friendships and at work, loyalty matters. It's good to be resourceful.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ethan Hunt may be a covert agent, but even operating in a world of violence and destruction, he's principled and dedicated.

In most instances, however, an effort is made to keep the gore and carnage off camera, so while bodies fly and things explode, the audience is not exposed to the grisly aftermath. There is some sexuality with kissing, mild foreplay, partial undressing, and post-sexual cuddling.

One leading member of the team is known to be a thief, but is redeemed by her self-sacrifice and grace under pressure.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Almost continuous action and violence beginning with a harrowing plane crash and explosion in which everyone aboard is killed. That is soon followed by a sequence that shows scary images of cell destruction caused by a deadly virus. The film's hero is a one man army, punching, using martial arts, driving skills, gunfire, and athleticism (including dangling from a sheer precipice) to fend off dozens of villains. Bodies fly; vehicles explode; automatic weapons are fired; a man\u2019s fingertip is cut off using a cigar clipper. There are point-blank shootings, flame throwers, lengthy hand-to-hand combat sequences, and high speed chases with careening, crashing vehicles.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Playful sexual innuendo when two characters are forced to hide in a bathtub together. Very soon afterward, they kiss passionately, start to undress, then are seen in post-sexual cuddling with only bare shoulders visible. More embraces and kisses follow as the relationship intensifies. It is implied that the film\u2019s heroine will voluntarily resume a former sexual affair in order to trap a villain.\n|Language|: Infrequent swearing including: \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"bastard.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Bulgari brand is visible.

It deals with issues surrounding family dynamics and the dangers (and benefits) of technology. The Mitchell family (voiced by Abbi Jacobsen, Maya Rudolph, Danny McBride, and Rianda) sets out on a cross-country road trip just as a new AI technology decides to capture and contain humanity. Expect scenes of peril and violence/destruction, but much of it is played for humor. The Mitchells are in danger of being hurt or abducted a few times, and robots use built-in weapons to attack and destroy. But the language never gets stronger than \"idiot\" and \"foolish,\" and there's no substance use or sexual content (though adults hug affectionately, and dating between main character Katie and her friend Jade is mentioned). Consumerism/product placement includes references to YouTube and a scene in which menacing Furby toys and smart Roomba-like vacuums turn evil (and ultimately awaken a giant, weaponized Furby). Families who watch together can have conversations about the pros and cons of technology and screen-time limits, as well as themes related to healthy communication and opportunities for family bonding.\n|Educational Value|: While mostly intended for entertainment, viewers will learn a bit about digital filmmaking, as well as teamwork and communication.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages parents and kids to have tech-free/off-screen experiences together, simultaneously acknowledging positive aspects of technology, like Katie's ability to be creative and make movies. Stresses importance of families being honest, understanding, accepting of one another's differences and interests. Teamwork, courage, communication are character strengths most explored. Underscores how art (film/visual art) can be transformative, how physical and practical skills can be lifesaving. Shows consequences of ignoring those who've supported and been there for you.\n|Positive Role Models|: Katie and her dad are encouraged to see things from the other's perspective. Entire Mitchell family learns to work together, communicate honestly, be brave and step way out of their comfort zones. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell are loving parents who will do whatever is needed to protect and take care of their kids. Katie and Aaron have a sweet, friendly rapport and look out for each other. Mrs. Mitchell and Aaron work together to help repair Katie and Mr. Mitchell's relationship. Mark Bowman is overconfident but learns some lessons in humility. Most main characters are White and/or robots.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril and danger/destruction. The Pal MAX robots fly down from the sky to capture humans and jail them in pods. The robots have built-in weapons in their arms. At one point, the whole family is holding on to one another in the air, but they land safely. The robots crash and are impaled, dismembered, taken offline. Toys and household appliances attack the Mitchells in a perilous sequence. In a scene of comedic violence, a robot treats the Pal CEO like an AI assistant: poking, swiping, zooming, demanding he sing, order pizza, etc. A robot drops him in the toilet and smears his face with nacho cheese. Mr. Mitchell tells his kids that they should be prepared to eat their dog.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Married adults hug affectionately. Katie chats with her classmate Jade; it's later said that they're dating.\n|Language|: \"Idiot,\" \"idiotic,\" \"butt,\" \"foolish humans,\" etc. Bathroom humor: The entire family throws up after eating at a poorly reviewed diner. In a short film, the dog is described as being able to \"lick my own butt.\" Aaron really has to go to the bathroom but ends up just reading in a portable toilet. An ongoing gag features the kids tricking their dad into getting kissed by their dog.\n|Products & Purchases|: Furby toys are featured prominently in one sequence. Sony-branded devices are seen.

With Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson voicing demigod Maui and a score that features original music by Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, the movie should appeal to viewers of all ages. Scary, perilous scenes include run-ins with frightening, violent monsters (one made of lava, the other a giant crab) and with ocean storms and waves. Characters also go up against a ship full of adorable (but armed) coconut pirates, a character dies (offscreen), and a couple of male authority figures yell at Moana. There's also a bit of language along the lines of \"butt\" and \"dumb.\" Otherwise, the movie should be fine for younger viewers, offering positive messages of self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about Polynesian myths and culture, as well as lessons about courage, teamwork, communication, curiosity, and perseverance.\n|Positive Messages|: Great messages about being a strong leader and staying true to yourself. Shows the benefit of taking risks to help others, even when that means sacrificing your status or your possessions. Promotes the value of owning up to your responsibilities, even when it's challenging. Also encourages teamwork, communication, and trusting others. The depiction of ancient Polynesian culture is Disneyfied but respectful.\n|Positive Role Models|: Moana is a wonderful role model and a strong female character. Unlike many movie princesses, her focus isn't on winning a prince -- instead, she's set on being a strong, successful leader for her people. She doesn't shy away from her responsibilities, but she also fearlessly follows her heart. She demonstrates curiosity and courage and inspires both in her fellow islanders, too. Maui starts off as a self-centered braggart, but he learns (from Moana) to be selfless and ends up being a patient mentor to her. Thoughtful representation of Polynesian culture.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several dark moments and potentially frightening scenes/images. A huge, fiery lava monster attacks the main characters. An elder tells the scary tale of why Maui was exiled. An elderly character dies and later returns as a spirit. Storms; characters tossed about violently by the ocean. Moana's father yells at her for wanting to go out on the ocean; Maui also yells at Moana. Cute but violent coconut pirates shoot arrows and poisoned darts at characters. A giant, creepy, glow-in-the-dark crab attacks Moana and Maui. Some comic violence, including when Moana hits Maui with an oar, a sidekick chicken nearly drowns, and a man is seen receiving a tattoo.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young boy dances and winks flirtatiously at Moana, and Maui is shirtless for the entire film, but there are no romantic elements.\n|Language|: No profanity, but characters do say \"butt,\" \"dumb,\" and \"heiney.\" Also some creative insults, like \"sharkhead,\" \"beady-eyed bottom feeder,\" \"filthy pile of pebbles,\" and \"lying son of a...\" Moana also tells the ocean that \"fish pee in you.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No brands featured in the movie, but the film is part of the Disney princess empire and has inspired countless products, from toys to games, clothing, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a99fb0d55001f54b089": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/moms-night-out", "cs_age": 11, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 11+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Moms' Night Out is a faith-based comedy about three stay-at-home moms who get away for a night on the town, only to have their plans dashed by unforeseen obstacles. Although there's virtually no language (aside from a couple of insults like \"tramp\") or sex (just a couple of brief marital kisses), the movie isn't really meant for younger viewers, who won't get the marital/domestic humor or the more mature themes about identity crises and maternal breakdowns. There's also some drinking (and a couple of characters who appear drunk or stoned) and punching/pushing/shoving. Although the trailers don't necessarily make it clear, Moms' Night Out contains overtly evangelical Christian messages and themes.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about the importance of motherhood -- and also about taking time for self care and finding fulfillment on multiple fronts. But the movie's reliance on traditional gender roles related to parenting may not resonate with all viewers.\n|Positive Role Models|: Allyson represents mothers who are stressed by the ins and outs of parenting, often without help from their partners; she loves her children but is frazzled. Her husband is kind and well meaning, but he's also a bit clueless when it comes to childcare. Traditional gender roles are reinforced.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A police officer accidentally tasers a woman. A man punches another man in the nose and is later head-butted by a different man. A father and son are both injured and taken to the hospital, where the father slams his own dislocated shoulder against a wall to snap it back into place. A woman pushes and shoves a man out of anger and frustration. A man is hit with pepper spray in the eyes.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of marital kisses and references to a new pregnancy. A mother makes it clear that her teenage daughter may not wear revealing clothes to go out with a boy.\n|Language|: Insults like \"tramp,\" \"pathetic,\" and \"leech on society.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Several Sony Vaio computers, a Toyota Sienna minivan, and Groupon are prominently featured, as is a biker's Harley tattoo (and motorcycle). Allyson has a Vera Bradley bag.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A couple of characters appear drunk or stoned. A recovering alcoholic (who's never seen) is said to have left in search for a drink, so characters set off to look for her at a bar.

Cartoon violence and the general threat of world annihilation by a sulky and lovelorn Dracula drive the action. So does his seeming longing for romance and lust for an annoying mortal. This makes it difficult to tell what age audience the filmmakers are aiming for. This may be because the book it was based on, Happy Family by David Safier, has erotic scenes that had to be cut to conform to PG rating requirements.  A character frequently passes gas, seen as a green mist that clears the room upon arrival. Language includes \"hell.\" Bullies dunk a smart kid in the toilet at school. His older sister constantly hits and kicks him. Vampires view humans as blood dispensers. Bikini-clad models inexplicably fawn over a creature who looks like Frankenstein's monster.

Vampires view humans as blood dispensers. \"Drinking the blood of humans is a messy affair.\" To avoid any actual neck-biting, the movie offers a red pill to satisfy vampire urges.

The movie is full of well-recognized monsters, with the family of main character, Max (voiced by Ethan Rouse), made up of a werewolf, vampire, Frankenstein's monster, and a mummy. The movie's action scenes are largely played for laughs, although sometimes with a hint of peril. These include a run-in with an angry yeti and a character trying to kill a girl by pulling off her flying backpack. During the movie, Max meets his nemesis, Mila (Emily Carey). She is a young girl collecting mythical creatures for her parents. But after completing her missions, her parents order her to be killed. Max is bullied online and in real life, with the intention being to show that nobody is perfect and that's OK. But the message feels forced, amid a messy and sometimes mean-spirited story.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids might be inspired to learn about mythical creatures such as the Loch Ness monster and yetis.\n|Positive Messages|: The main message is that nobody's perfect and that's OK. A happy family is viewed as creating mixed, but ultimately positive emotions. The movie features bullying in real life and on social media. A parent is shown to be a reckless driver, which is unquestioned and has no consequence.\n|Positive Role Models|: Max Wishbone is a young teen with an interest in science. When a relative is kidnapped he embraces his werewolf form and turns his family into their monster versions. Max is bullied on social media and in real life but learns that being himself is OK. Mila Starr is a young girl who is kidnapping mythical creatures under order of her parents. Her parents deceive her about the reason she's collecting them and once her mission is complete, order her to be killed.\n|Diverse Representations|: In the small main cast, no characters are people of color. Female characters are given prominent roles and are shown to be just as capable as their male counterparts.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of slapstick and playful action with characters regularly getting banged on the head with objects and falling into things. Some instances of threat. A character kicks a monster in the back. While in vampire form, a character threatens to drain someone's blood and must be restrained. An angry yeti throws snow and roars angrily.

With windows like eyes and a flying carpet that unfurls tongue-like out the front door to scoop up trespassers, the house is a wonderfully alive structure. But it's creepy. You don't want your kids waking up in the middle of the night freaked out that their house is going to eat them. Most of the PG content comes from the scariness; there are very few crude jokes or language issues. The kids are in constant peril, and they're not exactly role models. They break and enter, steal cough medicine, operate heavy machinery, and use sticks of dynamite. Likewise, the adults in this movie are creepy \u2013- not just Old Man Nebbercracker, but also the uninterested babysitter, detached parents, and clueless cops.\n|Positive Messages|: The children work together and learn an important lesson about the dangers of judging people by their appearances but these lessons are negated by the children's misdeeds.\n|Positive Role Models|: In their investigation, the kids steal, operate heavy machinery, break and enter, even use sticks of dynamite. The adults are unreliable and absent in their lives. The babysitter is mean, self-absorbed, and doesn't care about the kids. She allows her boyfriend in the house at night; he gropes her and is generally disrespectful. The kids display crude humor relating to bodily functions, and they pee in bottles to avoid leaving the room all night. A dad refuses to say \"I love you\" to his son\n|Violence & Scariness|: The house is a nightmarish creature that gobbles up neighborhood toys, pets, even people that trod on its lawn. It's scary, especially the last 20 minutes. The storyline includes dead and dying people; violent video games, guns and explosions; and there's a supernatural undercurrent to the movie that isn't appropriate for young kids. Nebbercracker and the babysitter's boyfriend make physical and verbal threats to the kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The boys are at an age where they're starting to think about girls, which comes out in their dealings with Jenny.

This animated comedy has fewer frightening antagonists than the original, but it does include several scenes of monsters trying to scare simulated (or in a couple of cases real) kids. The flying Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) is a scary sight, and there's some mild bullying and pranks from the popular fraternities and sororities toward Oozma Kappa (Mike and Sulley's frat of misfits). Some scenes imply a little bit of college \"partying\" (characters hold red party cups, the contents of which aren't discussed), and there's one kiss. Fans of the original comedy will recognize certain characters and themes, which ultimately emphasize friendship, teamwork, and perseverance to overcome your fears.\n|Educational Value|: This isn't an educational movie, but kids will learn a bit about the college experience (albeit a fictional one with monsters), the Greek system, and dorm life.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the original, the prequel stresses the importance of friendship, perseverance, and teamwork. The relationship between Sulley and Mike proves that once you get past superficial differences, others might have more in common with you than you first thought. Empathy is a major theme. The story also teaches that you shouldn't let others dictate whether you're good at something or not. If you're willing to work hard and team up with other people, you can accomplish almost anything.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mike works and studies hard while he's at the university, even though many of his classmates rely on their physical attributes. Sulley transforms from a procrastinator who doesn't study to a disciplined worker thanks to Mike's guidance. Sulley makes a mistake but owns up to it and faces the consequences.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Not really violence, just \"scares\" that include watching or listening to monsters scare real or simulated children. Several of the monsters have to practice various forms of scaring, and the flying dean is a frightening monster. In one scene, Mike and Sulley must frighten human adults. Mild bullying and pranks among the fraternities and sororities, including a pledging \"paddling\" scene that's briefly scary but turns comical.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Don and Ms. Squibbles show an interest in each other and eventually announce that they're engaged.

There's gunfire, explosions, widespread destruction, crowds panicking, and some deaths -- including one in which a good guy picks up a gun and accidentally shoots a bad guy, with no real consequences. Much of this is played for laughs, but it could be quite scary for young kids. One of the good guys is briefly presumed dead, which could also be upsetting. On the other hand, language is mild (\"jerk,\" \"stupid,\" etc.), and sexuality is mostly just flirting and discussing love/marriage, though there's one scene in which a couple is about to make out in a parked car. The movie is being released in both 2-D and 3-D versions; the 3-D one could be scarier for kids due to the finer line between fantasy and reality.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork and determination save the day here, but there's also a disrespect of authority figures who are shown as stupid and thoughtless.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main character is a self-reliant and confident girl.

Kids might be scared of the movie's concept initially, but they'll soon figure out that the monster Sulley is a softy who takes care of the little girl in the story who isn't the least bit afraid of him. However there's one scene where a monster the child does fear straps her to a chair and tries to steal her screams. Kids will find it funny that most monsters fear any contact with kids -- when one monster gets a child's sock on him the whole factory panics and biohazard workers quarantine and shave him. Young kids may need help understanding what the monsters in yellow suits are doing to him and why. Note: The 3-D version amps up the intensity.\n|Educational Value|: More for entertainment than education, though kids might learn a bit about factory work and how adults deal with hazards, like potential contamination (in this case, by children).\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages about the value of friendship and that facing your fears is a positive thing. Also, you can do the right thing and still succeed. Themes include courage, compassion, and integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mike and Sully are loyal friends. A monster learns to make kids laugh instead of scare them. Monsters try to do the right thing and protect a little girl. A powerful figure turns out to be a bad guy, but he pays for his poor choices.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comic peril, cartoon violence. The monsters are terrified of children for most of the film, which takes out some of the scariness. In the scariest climactic scene, the villain monster straps a toddler to a chair to catch her screams in a machine, and she appears very frightened. Her monster friend saves her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting and discussion of dating.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: This movie is part of the Disney-Pixar dynasty, with plenty of merchandise associated with the film.

Some of the rapid-fire jokes won't be detected or even understood by the youngest teens, and it's possible teens unfamiliar with this style of comedy won't get it at first, either. There's some profanity: \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"bastards,\" as well as words such as \"tart\" and \"pansy.\" The violence is obviously fake -- lots of gushing blood and killer rabbits, for example. God is depicted in an animated segment as being tired of overly contrite and \"depressing\" followers.\n|Positive Messages|: Humorous characters believe they're on a mission ordained by God. One character kills indiscriminately, saying, \"I can't help myself.\" Women are portrayed as either decrepit nags or virginal nymphs.\n|Positive Role Models|: As a parody of the legend of King Arthur, the chivalry of knights, and the barbarity of the Middle Ages, the characters are too silly to be considered positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence -- including severed limbs and slashed throats -- and lots of fake blood. Several sword fights. A contemporary historian is comically stabbed in the throat by a knight.

Like most other Emmerich films, the movie is filled with intense catastrophic damage, including tsunami super waves, flooding, and meteors going off like bombs. Despite constant imminent peril, remarkably few characters die. But guns are depicted positively as self-defense tools, including a teen using a pistol given to him by his father. Underlying the over-the-top spectacle are themes about the depth of a father's love and the importance of second chances and teamwork. Plus, star Halle Berry's character is a strong female role model: Jo rises to NASA's top leadership team while remaining an engaged, hands-on mom (it's also notable that \"Jo\" was once \"Joe\" -- the part was originally written for a man). Strong language includes \"a--holes\" and \"s--t,\" but what will really get your attention is the giant \"f--k\" spray-painted across a space shuttle. While the movie's plot is pretty wacky (even correlating with some wild conspiracy theories), NASA did cooperate and consult on the film. As a result, teens may actually learn a couple of things -- or at least appreciate the value of math, science, and physics.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of second chances, family, teamwork, listening to the \"crazy\" ones. Biggest takeaway is depth of a father's love, regardless of relationship they have with their child(ren).\n|Positive Role Models|: Jo is a brave, smart, composed, ambitious astronaut who rises to the top of NASA's executive team, successfully managing her work-life balance and maintaining a respectful co-parenting relationship with her ex-husband. Several examples of people putting aside their differences to work together. Characters who've been dismissed and ridiculed demonstrate courage and perseverance to help humanity. Most primary characters, including teens and children, make a contribution to saving Earth or their families.\n|Diverse Representations|: Racially diverse primary characters are portrayed positively and often in aspirational careers, including NASA scientists, high-ranking Pentagon officials, successful business owners. Women are in positions of power and authority and are shown as strong, confident, capable, intuitive. But lead protagonist remains a conventional White male hero.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense, large-scale catastrophic images. Deep peril throughout. Death and attacks from frightening unknown \"anomaly.\" Images of a super tsunami, flooding, meteors destroying cities and national landmarks. Cars explode during a fatal chase, killing villains inside. News images of rioters, police shooting into a crowd, people running in fear. Other than marauders using guns to rob people, handguns are mostly shown in a positive light. Children are separated from their parents but don't reflect emotions of fear or sadness. A parent sacrifices their life for their child.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"F--k\" is said a couple of times and is also written in large letters on the side of a space shuttle in a recurring image.

It takes place in the same universe as Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and, like those films, is rather flat and uninspired. Violence can be intense and includes monsters biting, slashing with claws, and fighting. Characters are killed, blood is shown, and there's gun use. Bullying kids try to beat up a young boy: They kick him, and he hits one of them in the head with his crutch. A woman who's shoved hits her head and is knocked unconscious. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t.\" People kiss, and shirtless males are seen. Social/background drinking is shown: Adults sip martinis and drink shots in a bar. Characters also use hypodermic needles to inject a secret formula.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie struggles with whether the serum is a gift or a curse: It provides great power but also requires a high price. Eventually both hero and villain partake, with no real consequences either way. In the end, everything thorny that the movie brings up is merely ignored or smoothed over.\n|Positive Role Models|: Michael Morbius is arguably the hero, or perhaps an anti-hero, but the fact that he kills a bunch of people is largely overlooked. Ultimately, it appears that he plans to keep on going, presumably drinking real blood to survive.\n|Diverse Representations|: All diverse representation is in supporting cast, as movie focuses on two White men. Black and Latino police officers, a Latina doctor who assists Morbius, a helpful nurse who's a woman of color (no specifics of her background are given), and a young Black girl who's one of Morbius' patients (though she's put into a coma and forgotten about for the rest of the movie).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Biting, slashing with claws.

There's also lots of martial arts fighting (punching, kicking, etc.), fighting with blades of all sorts, giant monster battles, and much more. Limbs and heads are sliced off, blades go through heads and torsos (slicing from head to navel), body parts burst, someone ends up with a huge hole through them after being shot, and a monster's heart is ripped out. Language is also very strong, with several uses of \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"s--t,\" etc. A character drinks a bottle of beer in one scene. Sex isn't an issue. While the story can be silly (and even dull sometimes), the great-looking action and diverse, likable heroic characters (who demonstrate courage) make the movie worth a look for mature fans.\n|Positive Messages|: Courage is shown in the movie's extremely simple (and very violent) good-versus-evil story, though not much teamwork is displayed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Movie has a very diverse cast. In departure from many Hollywood movies, White male characters are all either villains or turn out to be villains.

While essentially a good-hearted character, Deeds tends to solve his conflicts by getting into fist fights with those he disagrees with. Overall, this is another very silly Adam Sandler movie, rooted in obnoxious humor best for teens and older.\n|Positive Messages|: The film's central theme is on the importance of character over the trappings of wealth and fame, and this message is shown through example and through dialogue.\n|Positive Role Models|: In spite of his faults, Deeds is a genuine, \"what you see is what you get\" kind of character, the kind who doesn't care for the trappings of fame and fortune, and would rather be a good person to those around him.

There isn't any violence, but the store does throw a temper tantrum that sends toys flying after patrons (the red walls also fade to gray, and the toys lose their spark and color). A significant death, while presented in an idealized way to fit in with the tone of the film, is handled gently and poignantly; there are some sad scenes, but it's peaceful overall (though really young kids may need further explanation of how death really works). A young boy is looked at as a loner and has trouble making friends with other kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong positive messages about believing in yourself and others, as well as working together and staying open to the possibility of \"magic\" in everyday life.

Kids whose families are going through divorce might find this painful in spots (particularly the separations as seen from the parental perspective).

Expect some scary/intense battle scenes, weapons use, explosions, sad moments, and a very menacing bad guy. The Huns destroy Chinese villages and kill people (not shown). There's a bit of flirting/romantic tension. While Mulan ultimately becomes a hero and helps her people, she does so by rebelling against authority, which is worth discussing.

While pretending to be a man, she displays crude and stereotypical male traits, but it's bravado and is played for humor. She demonstrates perseverance, integrity, and courage. Some of the male characters have old-fashioned ideas about what females are capable of, but they learn the error of their assumptions in the end.

Directed by Niki Caro and featuring an ethnically Chinese cast, it's an epic martial arts retelling of the original ancient Chinese \"Ballad of Mulan.\" It's much more serious and intense than the animated movie, with fewer gender-bending jokes and no songs or wise-cracking dragon (sorry, Mushu fans). It's also more violent, with both large-scale and one-on-one battle sequences that leave people dead and injured, and a few close calls when main characters seem on the verge of death. Weapons include swords, bows and arrows, knives, and flaming projectiles shot from a catapult (yes, the avalanche scene is still here). Romance is limited to a few lingering looks and one meaningful but brief touching of hands. Mulan (Yifei Liu) strips down to take a bath in a river, showing her bare shoulders and part of her back. Her fellow soldier, a man, is shown shirtless. Fans of the 1998 version should keep their eyes and ears open for several Easter eggs, including a cameo by the original voice of Mulan, Ming-Na Wen. The themes of honor, honesty, and devotion to family and country and the challenging of gender stereotypes will give families plenty to talk about after watching Mulan together.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages are about importance of being true to yourself, not hiding your gifts, working hard, helping others, being honest, being loyal and devoted to both your family and your country. Other important themes include humility, perseverance, teamwork, challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mulan is brave, compassionate, clever, resourceful. While pretending to be a man, she sometimes tries to fit in, but also stays true to her beliefs about what's important in a partner, what being a warrior means. She disobeys her father, leaves her family, deceives her friends and fellow soldiers, but it's to protect her family and help her country. She demonstrates many important character strengths: courage, perseverance, humility, integrity, teamwork. Most men in the movie have traditional ideas about what women should be like or do but discover they're wrong. Chen Honghui is observant, a good listener who's quick to defend Mulan; instead of feeling betrayed or threatened, he helps and supports her. Mulan's father is patient, loving, honorable; her mother is caring and concerned; her sister is accepting, kind. Even villains have understandable motives, humanizing backstories.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several big martial arts battles with close combat, many deaths. Characters are killed, injured in various ways; very little blood shown. Most people are killed with swords. One falls into a fire. Others are dispatched by hand and/or buried by avalanche. Bows/arrows, knives, flaming projectiles. Peril and danger; people are taken captive, threatened. A shape-shifting witch uses her magic to disarm, kill, possess her enemies. A commander declares that the penalty for various offenses (including desertion and stealing) is death, while penalty for dishonesty is expulsion and disgrace. An older conscript with mobility issues falls in a humiliating manner in front of the Imperial guard.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few lingering looks. One scene of brief hand-holding.

Two of the main characters hang precariously off a rickety wooden bridge.

Through example and discussion, she also discusses the importance of following your heart instead of what others want you to do out of a sense of duty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mulan believes that women should marry out of love instead of duty to parents, family, or government; she believes that the heart is the one true determinant in these matters. She also instructs children in the art of finding their own sense of balance in the world.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Occasional cartoon violence and mild peril.

Set in numerous European luxury resorts and towns and on the Mediterranean Sea, the movie features Sandler and his co-star Jennifer Aniston as a married Brooklyn couple who get caught up in a series of jet set murders. Viewers can expect lots of action -- much of it exaggerated slapstick -- that includes murder by gunshot, poison, and dagger, with some bloody images. In addition, there are chases and life-threatening situations (e.g., a harrowing moment on a hotel ledge). Language includes both cursing (\"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"t-t,\" \"ass,\" \"pr--k\") and sexual jokes (\"getting laid,\" \"the boat does all the work\"), along with sexual conversations (about waning marital sex, infidelity, and more). One farcical scene shows a clothed couple unsuccessfully attempting to have sex with wild abandon. Many commercial products referenced or on display.\n|Positive Messages|: Good triumphs over evil. Honest communication is important in marriage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though often bumbling and incompetent, heroes are brave, resourceful, persistent. Their marriage is flawed but solid.

There's a bit of animated violence/peril that could frighten very young kids, including ponies nearly falling off cliffs or out of second-story buildings, a military-style robot attacking defenseless ponies, and characters being chased, pursued, or imprisoned. Earth ponies believe that unicorns can \"zap\" them with their \"horn lasers\" and \"fry\" their brains, and all the different pony communities are suspicious and fearful of each other. A group of fillies demonstrates compassion and courage in going against mainstream thinking to show that judging others without first-hand knowledge or experience is a mistake; openness and friendship are better than fear and distrust. In that sense, the film conveys that education about other people, places, and cultures can diminish misunderstandings and avoid unwarranted confrontations. Language is limited to childish taunts like \"stupid\" and \"brute,\" and the word \"butt\" is used in both song and dialogue. The film is built around the Hasbro brand and may inspire interest in further My Little Pony merchandising and products.\n|Educational Value|: Education about other people, places, and cultures can diminish misunderstandings and avoid unwarranted confrontations.\n|Positive Messages|: Stand up for what you believe in. Do your part in welcoming others with open arms. Don't rely on stereotypes or hearsay to judge or cut yourself off from those you don't know. Choose friendship over fear and distrust. The defense industry claims \"to be scared is to be prepared,\" but Sunny counters, \"fear is not your friend.\" The different pony populations needlessly move from defense to offense without any proof they're under threat.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sunny wholeheartedly believes her dad's lifelong lessons that unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies can all get along. This runs contrary to what the rest of the earth pony population believes, which marginalizes Sunny in her own community. They believe these other populations have magical powers and evil intentions to hurt earth ponies. Sunny shows compassion for others and courage in standing up for what she believes in. Phyllis runs a factory to produce unnecessary defense technology, and when her son Sprout becomes sheriff, the power goes to his head and he behaves belligerently. Sheriff Hitch, on the other hand, is able to pivot when faced with the reality that unicorns and pegasi aren't out to hurt him.\n|Diverse Representations|: The underlying message is not to judge or stereotype others based on appearances, physical or cultural differences, or hearsay. Sunny, Izzy, and Zipp represent a young generation open to relating with \"others.\" A line about choosing openness and friendship rather than \"building your wall.\" The cast behind the characters' voices is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Animated violence that could frighten very young kids includes ponies nearly falling off cliffs or out of second-story buildings, a military-style robot attacking defenseless ponies, and characters being chased or pursued in various scenes. Earth ponies believe unicorns can \"zap\" them with their \"horn lasers\" and \"fry'\" their brains. Two characters are imprisoned in a (not very scary) dungeon.

The ponies are back in vogue with everyone from toddlers to teenagers, so the movie could appeal to a wider age range than parents might expect. The content is mostly fine for even the youngest viewers, but there is a tiny bit of romance -- Twilight Sparkle has a crush on Flash -- and a bullying, power-hungry villain (Sunset Shimmer) who turns into a winged evil creature by the end of the story. Being a Pony movie, everything turns out just fine, and the Ponyville friends prove that together they can always overcome any obstacle.\n|Educational Value|: These movies are more about entertaining than educating viewers, but there are positive messages about teamwork, friendship, and believing in yourself.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's themes include overcoming self doubt, rising to the occasion of being a good leader, defending your friends, and working with others who can help you meet your goals.\n|Positive Role Models|: Twilight and her friends are all loyal and overcome any petty issues they have with each other to work together and save Equestria.

But it does have a few scenes that could frighten very young or sensitive children. Equestria (the pony homeland) is under attack by big, skunk-like villains who come out of the sky in airships that make dark clouds that blot out the sun. And ponies are shown in mortal danger -- for example, falling out of one of the airships -- but they are saved. An evil pony emits dangerous electrical sparks from her horn; at one point, a pony picks up a skull, and a bug crawls out and across the face. Otherwise, the movie is loaded with great takeaways -- support your friends, work together, don't give up, etc. -- as the ponies band together to drive out their rivals and put on a big Friendship Festival. Expect a couple of mildly rude moments -- two belches and a butt-scratch joke -- and a few scenes in which characters appear to be attracted to each other or jealous. But overall this is a sweet, gentle movie ideal for young grade-schoolers.\n|Educational Value|: Social-emotional lessons are frequent, circling around concepts like the meaning of friendship, what friends owe to each other, and what working together can accomplish. That said, the science is iffy: Airships can't just float through space without engines or some type of lighter-than-air gas, and it's unlikely that a flying pony could carry several other ponies her same size -- but it is a fantasy.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages are emphasized through dialogue, plot, and song, with lyrics highlighting confidence, teamwork, and working hard. Friends are supportive of one another, authority figures are thoughtful and kind, and the ponies' ultimate goals are peace, friendship, and fun.\n|Positive Role Models|: As on TV show, each pony has individual quirks -- Applejack can get feisty, Verity is vain, Pinkie Pie is daffy -- but they're all reliable, loving friends. Most of the villains are simplistically portrayed, but viewers see the motivation for one pony's misdeeds before she ultimately apologizes and tries to make reparations. Voice acting cast is diverse, with many actors of color in central roles. But note that \"good\" characters are usually depicted as being colorful, small, and cute, while \"bad\" characters tend to be dark, hulking, and unattractive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Action scenes may be too intense for very young kids: Scary, dark villains come out of the sky in airships that spread spooky black clouds, and several fights take place in midair, with ponies hurtling through the air (before being saved at the last moment). Ponies are turned into black statues with scared-looking faces; a villainous pony shoots electrical sparks from her horn that make other characters fall down. In a scene in which ponies walk exhaustedly through a desert, Pinkie Pie picks up a skull, and a bug crawls out and across her face. Ponies are trapped in cages by villains and almost fall over a giant waterfall.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Spike the dragon has a crush on Rarity, who in turn seems attracted to Capper the cat: \"You are quite charming!\" she says.

The language is never obscene; characters rely instead on insults (\"idiot,\" \"sicko,\" \"retarded\") and disguised swearing (\"frickin',\" \"flippin',\" \"crap\"). And there is mild sexual innuendo, along with some kissing and embracing. Napoleon's uncle tries to sell breast enhancement supplements door-to-door, so there's talk of breasts, breast size. There's a scene in which a school bus full of kids stops in front of a field where a farmer is on the verge of shooting a cow in the head with a rifle at point-blank range; the violence is not shown, but strongly implied by the reactions of the kids. Napoleon Dynamite became a box office bonanza and a cultural phenomenon, and spawned an animated series.\n|Positive Messages|: Nonconformity is celebrated in Napoleon Dynamite. Underneath the silliness and deadpan behavior of its main characters is the premise that even the lowliest members of a social order can succeed. Everyone has something to offer, no matter how offbeat or unconventional. Dignity and respect are possible by creating friendships and forming a community of people with whom one shares values and goals. Themes include compassion and empathy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Reluctant respect is given to dysfunctional individuals who seem at first to be only objects of scorn. Laughing at the characters becomes laughing with the outrageously geeky as they win the day. Authority figures and adults are portrayed as clueless, self-serving, or both; for example, while comic in its intent, the authority figures (in addition to some of the students) of the high school reveal prejudice and cultural insensitivity toward a Mexican teenager new to the school.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Teens ineptly wrestle, slap, and fight. A school bully is shown putting Napoleon in a headlock and pushing him in the locker; this same bully does this to another smaller teen, then attempts to grab the boy's bike as he unlocks it from the school bike rack. A school bus full of young kids stops the moment a farmer shoots and kills one of his cows with a rifle; the violence is not shown but strongly implied through the reactions of the kids. One of the lead characters is beaten up by a jealous husband when the husband catches him selling breast augmentation supplements to his wife; violence not shown, but implied by the injuries on the character's face and body.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Other than numerous scenes that include comical efforts to sell an herbal breast-enhancing product (using flyers and \"straight-talking\" sales pitches), sexuality is limited to mild kissing and embracing and exaggerated attempts at seduction, all with humorous intent. No nudity.\n|Language|: Insults and substitutes for obscenities only: multiple uses of \"idiot,\" \"frickin',\" \"retarded,\" \"crap,\" \"sicko,\" and \"flippin'.\" One character is described as \"still wets the bed.\" One of the characters becomes a door-to-door salesman passing out fliers for breast enhancement treatments.\n|Products & Purchases|: Dodge van, Tater Tots, Gossner Foods milk.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682f8718ba001e31357e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/national-lampoons-christmas-vacation", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that much of the slapstick humor in 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is obviously directed at younger viewers -- from the cartoon opening to an impossibly high-speed sled ride -- but language and sexual references make it iffy for kids and tweens. Many of the movie's laughs depend on mishaps like falling from ladders or traveling in a car stuck underneath a big rig, but no people get hurt (a pet cat does get electrocuted). The salty talk is toned down a bit from the previous Vacation movies, but there's still plenty of four-letter words, including \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" some said by kids. The movie makes all of its characters look ridiculous, but the only negative stereotype is of a busty woman who sells lingerie in the local mall. Some characters are continually drunk.

The action in this fast-paced adventure sequel is loud and sometimes tense (car chases, near falls from high ledges in a dark cave, etc.), but for the most part it's pretty tame. The most troubling scene comes early, when, in a flashback to 1865, a child sees his father shot and killed; the sequence also includes a reenactment of Abraham Lincoln's assassination (not bloody, but obvious). In the present day, there's some shooting, car crashes, hand-to-hand fighting, and threats made with guns. Expect some cleavage shots, plus innocuous flirting and kissing. There are also moments where the lead characters are in England and adopt cringe-worthy fake English accents while saying every stereotypical British expression they can think of.\n|Positive Messages|: Hacking into official computer systems, breaking laws, and, in one instance, kidnapping the president. Bad guys trick good guys into finding treasure, then threaten them and use violence.\n|Positive Role Models|: No positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent raucous action-adventure-style scenes, including car chases (banging, crashing, screeching), shooting, and fighting. There's a reenactment of Abraham Lincoln's assassination, but the gunshot to his head isn't particularly graphic. In a flashback scene, a young boy sees his father shot and killed.

Tense teetering and near falls from precarious surfaces inside a cave; rush of water nearly drowns people trapped in the cave.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some romantic, chaste kissing between the main couple.

It's directed at teens, with actors they know from shows like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things (and the same director as The Fault in Our Stars). But it's as much a horror film as it is a superhero action fantasy: Expect lots of violence, some of it bloody. The teen mutants' situations are extremely dark, including a religious leader branding a girl and the strong implication of child rape. Terrifying animals and monsters attack relentlessly, children are tortured, and the mutants attack each other. All of the mutants are being held in a remote hospital because they've killed at least one person; only a few show remorse. Teens joke about sex, and two romances develop, each resulting in a kiss. The kids curse (\"bitch,\" \"s--t\"), but not excessively. The message is tailor-made for a generation that's grappling with anxiety and depression, and it's repeated over and over: Don't let fear ruin your life, you can conquer your demons. The X-Men have always led the way when it comes to superhero diversity, and this film takes it a step further: The ensemble is more inclusive in terms of gender, sexuality, economic status, and ethnicity than ever before.\n|Positive Messages|: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Themes of self-discovery and fighting your personal demons.\n|Positive Role Models|: Super-powered characters have flaws but also represent diversity across race, gender, sexuality, economic status (e.g., lead character is a Cherokee lesbian). Women demonstrate notable defensive strength.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Stories of kids killing people; some of them are remorseful, but not all. Children are shown in peril and being tortured. Fantasy violence includes attacks from giant creatures, monsters, and a priest. Some blood. Visual metaphorical implication that a child was a victim of sexual violence. Thwarted suicide attempt. One character hits himself several times. Scary imagery of a skeleton on fire.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two teen romances. Same-sex and opposite-sex kissing.

Nicolas Cage's character gets involved in several fights, and the FBI and the terrorists display enough ammo to fill the national armory. While there's no real gore (or blood, for that matter), the images are still disturbing. There's only one love scene, but there's a lengthy scene preceding it with Jessica Biel wrapped in a towel. Thanks to Biel's popularity and Cage's action cred, expect teens to want to see it, even though it's not being marketed as a teen film.\n|Positive Messages|: The superhero's creed \"with great power comes great responsibility\" is in effect.

While relationships are at the core of the story, viewers can also expect lots of cartoon mayhem: robot battles, human fighting, explosions, laser and gunfire, falls, chases, a human held captive, bullies, and threats to the entire populace. A quick-tempered pet erupts in angry gibberish to simulate swearing, which is then bleeped.

When the main character's (Russell Crowe) wife is accused of murder and imprisoned for life, he decides as a last resort to break her out of jail, no matter what the consequences. His choices and actions send a mixed message to teens about respecting the law, but, on the flip side, those same decisions may prompt some interesting discussions. Expect some language (including \"s--t\" and one \"f--k\"), references to drugs and drug dealers, and some sexual situations/talk, but no actual nudity.\n|Positive Messages|: In some ways, the movie makes a statement about a broken justice system, but it also demonstrates the wrong way to go about fixing it. John essentially chooses his loved ones over the law, and he breaks the law in many different ways to restore order to his family. He must do this mostly by himself and can't trust any other characters, nor ask for help. He rarely faces the ethics involved in his choices and actions.\n|Positive Role Models|: John makes a choice and sticks with it, going to extraordinary lengths to solve a difficult problem and get his family back together. Unfortunately, he breaks the law many times in many different ways to accomplish this. He ignores teamwork and ethics, choosing to work mostly by himself and/or tricking people into helping him. In some ways, John is right, but in other ways, he's acting out of desperation and with no regard for the consequences of his actions.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Flashbacks of a murder are shown from several different angles and with different scenarios and outcomes. A woman is bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher; there's some blood. The hero is violently beaten up outside a bar. In another sequence, he pulls a gun and becomes involved in a shoot-out and a fire in a house filled with drug dealers; he also tries to drive a wounded man to the hospital. There's a notable amount of blood in these sequences. Also a suicide attempt and a mean, biting dog. Plus lots of tension, shouting, and screaming and an intense chase sequence.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The married couple at the center of the film is very amorous; they have implied sex in their car (when they arrive home, their clothes and hair are askew). Talk of conjugal visits in prison. A woman flirts with the hero. A dinner discussion revolves around the power of sex in the workplace, and one woman wears a low-cut dress.\n|Language|: Relatively infrequent use of words/phrases like \"s--t,\" \"piss,\" \"t-ts,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddeamn,\" and \"son of a bitch.\" Also one \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A character drives a Prius; it becomes a crucial part of the plot.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The hero visits a bar and tries to buy drugs from drug dealers.

The movie features frantic, cartoonish violence by the museum exhibits that come to life. This includes shooting (Civil War soldiers), explosions (miniature cowboys and miners), poison dart-shooting (miniature Mayans), chasing and hunting (dinosaur skeleton, lions), fighting, and car-crashing. Weapons include arrows, swords, guns, catapults, spears, axes. There's a repeated joke about Attila the Hun's preference for ripping off victims' limbs. Larry has an antagonistic relationship with a monkey and repeatedly disappoints his son (who acts sad) -- until the end, when he's impressed by his father's quick decision-making.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will pick up a few bits and pieces about historical characters and eras -- though much of it isn't exactly textbook accurate.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the potty humor and fast-paced antics is a message about going after your dreams -- Larry tries to inspire his son to pursue his dreams, and Larry eventually learns to try harder for what he wants, too.

Main characters get into fights and are threatened with weapons (guns, spears, swords) and words, but no one is seriously injured. One thing that's \"missing\" is the uneven father-son relationship from the first movie -- this one skips the family angst in favor of a more romantic subplot that helps keep things more upbeat overall. There's a little language and some kissing, but no drinking or smoking.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will pick up a few bits and pieces about historical characters and eras -- though much of it isn't exactly textbook accurate.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has a strong positive message about being true to yourself and doing what you love in order to be happy.

Some fighting. Plenty of action and peril, but most of it comes with a lighthearted, adventurous tone. A giant octopus wreaks havoc in some scenes, which scare younger kids -- as could a creepy sequence involving a gate to the Egyptian underworld. Larry gets in a slapping match with a pair of monkeys.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirting, a few kisses (a couple fairly passionate), and a couple of innuendoes (the latter will likely go right over kids' head).

Most of the group puts the others before themselves. Larry's son, now a teenager, learns to stand up for himself. At first, the vain Sir Lancelot wants to help with Larry's quest, but he turns on the group. Security guard Tilly falls asleep at her job.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The opening scene foreshadows that the \"end will come.\" The animals and dinosaurs come to life and terrorize party guests. Sir Lancelot fights a dinosaur (and later a giant snake) with a sword. Octavius and Jebediah are trapped by lava and fire from a volcano. Statues come to life and move around in a creepy way. Lancelot turns on the group. For a moment, it appears that Dexter, the Capuchin Monkey, and the rest of the gang have died.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Laa, a Neanderthal, and Tilly, a security guard, flirt and kiss.\n|Language|: Words include \"hell\" and \"dang it.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Posting on Facebook is mentioned, and iPhones are used often. A woman is seen playing Candy Crush. World of Warcraft is mentioned.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Young adults drink at out of red solo cups at a house party; adults drink wine at a fundraiser.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a827a53e9001e707430": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/nightcrawler", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Nightcrawler is a crime drama/thriller about an outcast who finds he has a calling filming gory footage for the TV news -- and ends up going to extreme lengths in pursuit of his \"talent.\" There's strong violence -- including shootings, car crashes, blood, and dead bodies -- but the most disturbing thing is the callous, cold nature with which it's all filmed. Language includes multiple uses of \"f--k\" and a few uses of \"s--t.\" Sex comes up when the lead character negotiates sexual favors with a woman he likes; nothing is shown, but it's referred to. Despite the strong content, older teens might find the film thought provoking -- and come away with some interesting, relevant questions and ideas about the nature of news and the media.\n|Positive Messages|: This is an extremely cynical movie. The main character's position is that, as long as you can negotiate and never give in, you can get anywhere in the world, even if what you're doing is unethical or illegal. And if anyone stands in your way, it's OK to cut them down. Also thought-provoking themes regarding the nature of news and media.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character is pathological and perhaps even insane, yet he still represents some of the qualities that are admired in successful people. He argues and persuades his way into any situation and knows how to wear people down to get what he wants. He's willing to do just about anything, unethical or illegal, to help his own cause. But the movie presents him (mostly) as someone not to be emulated.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence, while often intense, is less shocking than the main character's callous attitude toward it. Whether it's a shooting or a car crash, he simply films it as if it's nothing. Several dead bodies, shootings, and blood. Gory news footage. The main character beats up a security guard and steals his watch. At a crime scene, he drags a dead body several feet to make for a better shot.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character negotiates a deal with a woman he likes to be his sex partner, even though she's not interested in him or attracted to him. None of this is shown, but there's a spoken reference to it. Also some brief innuendo.\n|Language|: \"F--k\" is used fairly frequently, as are \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" and \"goddamn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The character uses a Sony camcorder. Several ads are seen during TV news broadcasts, including one for Bird's Eye frozen vegetables that's shown twice.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770d96afb3d0020623475": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/nightmare-alley", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Nightmare Alley is a neo-noir from director Guillermo Del Toro. It's extremely dark and vicious but worth watching for the director's mature fans. Expect to see disturbing images, guns and shooting, murders, blood and gore, violent punching (including a man being punched to death), strangling, someone getting run over by a car, and a carnival performer biting the head off of a chicken. The main character (Bradley Cooper) is briefly seen fully naked while in a bathtub; a woman reaches into the water and begins stimulating him. He has three sexual partners over the course of the movie. He kisses a scar on a woman's chest, and her breasts are partly visible. There's also kissing and some sex-related dialogue. Language is strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch, and more. Characters smoke cigarettes frequently, and two characters are portrayed as having an alcohol dependency. There's also a reference to opium-laced alcohol. Willem Dafoe, Toni Collette, David Strathairn, Rooney Mara, and Cate Blanchett co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Terrible behavior (murder, stealing, betrayal, etc.) has consequences, sometimes enormous ones.\n|Positive Role Models|: All of the charaters are devious backstabbers, with the possible exception of Molly, who seems kind and loyal to her carnival family, though she doesn't really act with any agency.\n|Diverse Representations|: All of the main and secondary characters are White; a few background characters are played by actors of color. A little person appears in a few scenes and -- as one of the carnival owners -- is empowered, although he still must work the grounds. (Thankfully without resorting to any demeaning acts.) Women are generally not the driving force of the story, except for Dr. Ritter, but (like the hero), she's pretty loathsome.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Guns and shooting. A woman shoots her husband and then herself. Blood spurts/smears, gory wounds. Characters die/dead bodies shown. Violent punching. A character is punched to death; bloody, gory face. Person pulls shard of bone from knuckle. Character's head hit with a rock. Strangling with phone cord. Person hit deliberately by car and killed; bloody corpse seen. Medically vulnerable character murdered by leaving windows open and letting cold in. Carnival performer bites the head off of chicken, blood shown. House on fire.

A man is said to have forced a woman to miscarry. A man confesses to having \"hurt many, many women.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character has sex with three partners over the course of the movie. Brief full-frontal male nudity (bathing in tub). Married woman reaches into the tub; suggestion of sexual stimulation under the water. Woman opens her coat to reveal a scar on her chest and partial breasts; another character kisses the scar. Kissing. Sex-related dialogue.\n|Language|: Strong language includes uses of \"f--k,\" \"motherf----r,\" \"bulls---,\" \"bitch,\" \"bastard,\" \"balls.\" Uses of \"G-damn,\" \"Oh God,\" \"Jesus,\" \"Christ Almighty,\" \"My God\" and \"Oh Christ.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The main character avoids drinking for a while and then becomes a serious alcoholic.

That said, it does have scary creatures in it -- characters take off their own heads and limbs, and there are skeletons, nasty toys, and a creepy villain named Oogie Boogie. A Christmas tree even burns up. Some little kids who aren't old enough to distinguish this fantasy from the goings on at Halloween (or those prone to nightmares) might steer clear, although you can always hit pause and talk about what's scaring them. The special 3D version is identical in content and storyline to the original, but the enhanced visuals may add marginal spookiness and could further blur the line between fantasy and reality for some younger kids.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about different holidays and respecting different cultures and customs.\n|Positive Messages|: Jack Skellington wants to take over Christmas, but he learns the lesson that the grass isn't always greener. The movie advocates thinking before you act and being grateful for what you have.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jack Skellington is a kind-hearted and likable character. He makes mistakes but ultimately learns from them and corrects them. He doesn't act out of malice, and he's enduringly innocent. Sally, Jack's love interest, is the only character to speak out against his plan to take over Christmas. She also helps Jack to correct his mistakes, at great risk to herself.

In this version, Oscar-nominated actor Jackie Earle Haley plays Freddie as a more twisted, tragic figure -- a suggested child molester (though nothing is seen or even overtly discussed) -- who is taking his revenge against the people who destroyed him. The movie contains strong language (including \"f--k\" and \"bitch\") and some mild hints of teen sexuality, as well as some references to drugs (for staying awake).\n|Positive Messages|: The primary themes here are vengeance, denial, and fear. In flashbacks, it is suggested that Freddie Krueger is a child molester. Rather than alerting the authorities, the parents of his victims hunt him down and kill him. Returning through dreams and nightmares, Freddie then takes his revenge by hunting and killing the children, now teenagers.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the teens are problem solvers, constantly searching for ways to save their lives and the lives of their friends, their parents are basically vigilantes -- and clearly Freddy's no role model.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie contains tons of horror violence, including throat-slashing, body-slashing, body-slamming, cigarette lighter-burning, face-slashing, burning bodies, car crashes, eye-stabbing, and severed hands. Additionally, we see plenty of terrifying nightmare imagery, such as a girl sinking into a lake of blood. This movie also hints that, in his past life, Freddie Krueger was a child molester, although nothing is actually shown or overtly mentioned.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No nudity or sex, but two teens are seen lying in bed together, and two other teens share a kiss. Teen girls are shown wearing tight, sexy clothing from time to time. Freddie occasionally makes some sexual remarks aimed at the teen girls.\n|Language|: At least nine uses of \"f--k\" (in various forms), and at least four uses of \"s--t\" (in various forms). Additionally, we hear \"bitch,\" \"pissed,\" \"hell,\" \"asshole,\" \"Jesus,\" and \"God\" as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Characters use the \"Gigablast\" Internet search engine more than once.

Scenes include bloody wounds, jarring acts of aggression (shooting, fighting), and psychological abuse (the primary villain is especially unnerving in his calm demeanor, callousness, and ingenuity). Several scenes involve lengthy shootouts between characters with large guns, as well as contemplations of the bloody aftermath. You can also expect frequent references to drugs (the $2 million at stake is part of a heroin deal gone bad), some drinking, and language (the one use of \"f--k\" is by a young boy).\n|Positive Messages|: A killer is a sociopath; an opportunistic cowboy steals drug money, then becomes hunted; a weary sheriff philosophizes about bad deeds, lack of courtesy, and generational changes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of violence, both brutal acts and bloody aftermath. Sheriff describes crime scenes (e.g., \"blood all over the floor\"). Weapons include shotguns, knives, and pistols; villain also uses an oxygen tank to shoot through victims' heads (no bullet, deadly hole). Several shootouts go on for long minutes, featuring blood, stylized shadows, speedy cuts, loud guns, and breaking glass and furniture. Early scene includes multiple corpses shown shot and drying in the sun, as well as a survivor begging for water. A dog attacks Llewelyn, who shoots it mid-leap (no blood, but big teeth and loud noise); he's left with wounds and bloody feet. Villain washes and sews his own bloody wound (shown in close-up). Shooting victim shows bloody neck and gurgles; body left floating in a pool; other bodies in a parking lot and motel room. A car accident leaves a man bloody; he stumbles out and reveals his broken arm (bone exposed) to two boys.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Villain is naked in a bathtub, but no explicit shots.\n|Language|: The characters are generally laconic, offering occasional colorful commentary, including one use of \"f--k\" (by a child), several uses of \"hell\" and \"ass,\" plus one or two uses of each of the following: \"goddamn,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch\" (one with \"son of a\"), and \"swinging dick.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Details/logos used to establish location: Texaco gas station, Southwestern Bell bill.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The plot turns on a large quantity of heroin (shown at the film's start in brick form) and money.

It's a frank exploration of a modern-day relationship that's founded on a largely sexual basis, so you can expect plenty of unfiltered talk about sex, as well as characters shown in various states of undress and in compromising positions. There's also frequent swearing (including \"f--k\" and \"s--t\"), social drinking, and references to drugs. Despite the mature content (and plenty of romcom cliches), the movie is surprisingly sweet and does address questions about commitment.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the frank sexual content, there's a romantic message: You can\u2019t choose who you love, and you can\u2019t control how to fall in love. There's also the suggestion that no matter how accomplished you are, life isn't complete without love.\n|Positive Role Models|: The two main characters may be neurotic and full of bravado, but they\u2019re also appealingly human. And though they might be confused about what a real relationship entails, they're kind and caring toward each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A young man punches an older man in the stomach.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The movie revolves around the idea of two friends hooking up purely for sexual gratification. They're shown in various states of undress -- him in nothing but a towel to cover his privates, her in underwear -- and in compromising positions. There are plenty of innuendos, and sex is discussed with much candor, including specific acts. Two women are shown making out.\n|Language|: Language includes frequent use of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"c--k,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"crap,\" \"oh my God,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands that are name- or label-checked include BMW, Stella Artois, Jolly Rancher, 7-Up, Patron, and Prius.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A father smokes a joint with his adult son.

It's more epic, tragic, and emotional than is typical for the franchise, and, despite its length (163 minutes), it's worth seeing for teen and adult fans. Expect the usual guns and shooting, fighting, chases, crashes, and stunts. While there's little blood, characters are killed, some by gruesome, face-blistering chemical weapons. A child and a teen are in peril at different points; the teen shoots a gun and falls into an icy lake. Characters kiss passionately and lie in bed together; there's the suggestion of nudity, but nothing explicit is shown. Infrequent language includes a use of \"f--k\" and a use of \"s--t,\" plus \"ass,\" \"Jesus Christ,\" etc. Characters drink frequently in social situations, and one minor character appears drunk. Smoking is also shown. While there are more diverse representations here than in previous Bond movies, it does still perpetuate the stereotype that people with disabilities are villainous.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is largely about violence and how it scars us. Asserts that it's our choices that make us who we are. A choice is made here that proves the point.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bond often relies on violence to accomplish his goals, is frequently driven by revenge, has his share of vices, has been known to choose iffy ways of resolving problems. But he's loyal to the end, determined to carry out his mission. He even makes a great sacrifice to save the rest of the world. The three main characters all have violent pasts and have been shaped in various ways by those pasts.\n|Diverse Representations|: While Bond is (as ever) a White man, there's a fairly diverse cast of supporting characters. Nomi, a Black woman, is the newest double-0 agent; Moneypenny is also now a Black woman; Poloma proves she can fight alongside Bond with no trouble; and CIA agent Felix Leiter is Black. This installment also shares the fact that Q dates men. The actor who plays the villain, Rami Malek, is of Egyptian ancestry. Unfortunately, the series continues to indulge in the damaging stereotype that people with disabilities are villainous. In this case, Malek's character has a facial difference.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Guns and shooting. Many characters are shot and/or killed. Explosions. Faces blister, characters scream and die from a deadly chemical weapon. Blood drips from a wound. Choking. Fighting, stunts. Car and motorcycle chases and crashes. Sinking boat. Children in peril. Teen who's stalked by a masked killer falls into a frozen lake; teen shoots man with pistol. Jump scare. Villain's false eye pops out, false eye fried by electromagnetic pulse. Poison plants.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple is shown kissing passionately and lying in bed together. A topless woman lies face down with her bare back shown (bottom covered by sheet).

Looking for an outlet for his rage, Hutch ends up taking down a group of young men who are out for a night of partying, putting them all in the hospital and near death. His targets aren't portrayed as great guys -- they drive under the influence, and they make an inappropriate comment to a young woman who's sitting alone on a bus -- but their behavior doesn't warrant Hutch's vicious attack. Violence is graphic and extreme, escalating as the film progresses, with deaths getting more over-the-top and gory. Think shootings, stabbings, punches, bombings, and more. And so many guns: Nearly every male character is packing a weapon or blowing someone away, with pieces ranging from a .38 special to an Uzi. (Toxic masculinity, anyone?) The villain snorts cocaine, and heroic characters drink. Language is strong, with \"f--k\" as the word of choice. There's a quick glimpse of BDSM photos.\n|Positive Messages|: Not a message movie, but there's an underlying notion that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hutch protects his family and prioritizes their safety, and he demonstrates self-defense skills, but he also viciously attacks people.

A teenage couple agrees to have sex, but then she becomes very flustered and anxious, and an engaged girl has sex with a man who isn't her fiance. Characters drink and smoke; there's also brief battle violence and some poignant deaths. Teens will be watching with rapt attention to pick up clues about what true, passionate love looks like, but this type of sensual story may not be appropriate for the youngest teenagers.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's ultimate message is that true love conquers all. But there are also less-positive takeaways influenced by the time in which the movie takes place -- people of color are often portrayed as subservient, and both Ali and her mother say: \"I am a stupid woman,\" as though repeating a truism that they have learned.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though it's romantic to watch characters fall in love so wholly and stay devoted to each other, some of the choices that the lovers make -- like cheating on a relationship and lying to family members -- don't qualify as role model behavior.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Noah and Finn are engaged in active duty during World War II.

Some poignant deaths.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Steamy passion between the two young lovers. Lots of making out and heavy petting, and characters undress in front of each other (only their shoulders are shown). A fairly graphic lovemaking scene (again, just shoulders visible, plus a brief glimpse of breast from the side).\n|Language|: Words/phrases used include \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"goddammit,\" \"son of a bitch,\" and \"pain in the ass.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A 17-year-old smokes a cigar. Adults drink cocktails, wine, champagne, and beer. Noah goes on a 10-day drinking binge. Characters drink in excess to ease pain or to lessen their inhibitions.

Viewers can also expect intermittent swearing, including derivations of \"s--t,\" and a brief scene featuring a scantily clad woman astride a man. A character drinks too much at a bar, and several labels are seen/mentioned.\n|Positive Messages|: Justice circles back, even if it takes years. Also, ingenuity and hard work pay off, with patience.\n|Positive Role Models|: In many ways, the leads of Now You See Me, magicians and mentalists who call themselves the Four Horsemen, aren't really role models. They scheme, steal, and fool. But it's not for personal gain, which is somewhat admirable. A man comments about a central female character's weight twice.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few action-packed fight scenes that look brutal, though viewers don't see any gore: A man's sleeve is trapped in a garbage disposal, and there's lots of kicking, punching, and head-banging. Guns are drawn. In one pretty gnarly car chase, a car tumbles after hitting a median, with the driver dying in a fiery crash.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirty banter and a sweet kiss. A girl strips to her underwear and makes out with a guy. Some innuendo. A woman is very briefly seen topless in a Mardis Gras crowd; hands are covering her breasts.\n|Language|: Includes several uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"d--k,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" and the like.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several labels seen/mentioned: MGM Grand, Starbucks, Skype, Nokia, BMW.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A character is shown drinking too much at a bar.

It reunites most of the actors from the original film (including Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, and Mark Ruffalo) -- and adds some newbies (like Daniel Radcliffe) -- for another entertaining caper. There are plenty of intense action and fight sequences that might be too bone-crunching for younger viewers (characters punch, shoot, and throw things at each other, people fall out of planes, etc.), and the traumatic death of a character's father when the character was a young boy is discussed frequently. Expect some swearing -- including \"damn,\" \"s--t,\" and \"a--hole\" -- as well as social drinking and a passionate kiss.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the scheming and plotting, teamwork and loyalty are strong theme -- i.e., united you stand, divided you fall. Sometimes, letting go of anger and resentment is the fastest path to inner peace.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the the Four Horsemen and their leader, Dylan Rhodes, don't always have pure intentions/methods (they scheme, steal, etc.), they're ultimately motivated by a need to avenge the innocent and unmask the guilty. And they do often end up doing what they think is right and just.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters speak with relish about killing others. In a few intense fight sequences, characters punch, shoot, and throw things at each other (in one scene, a glass bowl is thrown at an assailant's face) and shove each other around. Tables are upturned, cars catch on fire, characters are thrown out of planes -- it\u2019s mayhem. A child watches a magic act in which his father drowns; a disturbing reenactment of that incident nearly ends in tragedy again. In some of the magic tricks, it's made to look as if Lula's head and hand are cut off, with blood spurting everywhere.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A passionate kiss.

Violence is quite graphic: Expect to see pools of blood, a river of blood, slashed skin, stabbing, dead bodies, bodies on fire, and blood-covered body parts. Characters die (both at others' hands and by suicide), and there's a scene with guns and shooting. The movie is also full of jump scares and scary images. Language is infrequent; there's a single use of \"s--t,\" plus \"God,\" \"hell,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" in a faith-based context. There's brief flirting and light drinking (a glass of wine with dinner, beers in the local pub). This film sadly feels like a dashed-off quickie, without much effort put into it, but its characters and setting may still appeal to some horror fans.\n|Positive Messages|: Brief but interesting dialogue about how the Bible is \"God's love letter to us\" and how asking questions and discussing things (rather than everything being fixed/rule-bound) are likely part of God's plan.\n|Positive Role Models|: A priest and a novitiate, clearly good people, act bravely and risk their lives to save each other and, hopefully, the world. A kind-hearted local risks his reputation to help them. That said, so little happens here that even the characters' bravery and good intentions don't seem to amount to much.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Jump scares. Monster attacks. Scary stuff.

Human characters use guns, and there are several scenes in which it seems like a character will die or be killed. Language includes insults like \"moron,\" \"nothing,\" and \"stupid\"; parents sensitive to scatological humor should know there are several burp and fart jokes. On the bright side, there's a positive message about what it means to be part of a community.\n|Educational Value|: Kids may learn which park animals must store nuts to survive, but otherwise the movie is intended for entertainment, rather than education.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overwhelming message is to learn to be part of a community -- where helping others and being helped in return is part of life. Surly's adventure makes him realize why he needs the animals in the park, and they discover that he's much more than the selfish squirrel they pegged him as at the beginning of the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: Andie is smart, loyal, kind, and brave. She isn't afraid to get into dangerous situations to help her fellow park dwellers. She's committed to justice and fairness. Surly's story is one of redemption and learning to be part of a community. Buddy is a faithful and unconditional friend to Surly, even when no one else is willing to stand by him.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few jump-worthy moments, like when a dog pops up right in front of Surly or a scary rat gang attacks Surly and then appears about to kill Buddy. The humans are old-school gangsters who use guns to shoot at each other and the animals. Cars blow up and go over bridges; an important park tree burns down. A cardinal starts to peck at characters and acts in an evil manner. But even when it seems like characters meet their end, audiences later see they've survived (albeit hurt). Some characters act nobly but are secretly mean and violent.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Grayson keeps flirting with Andie and insisting she go on a date with him. He touches and dips her, but she's not interested. Surly develops a crush on Andie, too, and they share a couple of hugs.

There are drones that kill instantly and turn their victims into ashes; several people die, including a few major characters. The language is pretty tame except for an occasional \"s--t\" and \"damn\" -- and one particularly memorable \"f--k you.\" Sexuality includes a few passionate kisses and one seduction scene in which a woman is shown naked from the back. Oblivion is likely to appeal most to families with older teens who are either Tom Cruise fans or partial to futuristic action flicks.\n|Positive Messages|: Somewhat grim circumstances, but the movie highlights the way that humans manage to survive under the most difficult circumstances. Challenges people to listen to their instincts, to question following instructions and commands blindly, and to pay attention to their dreams. Also promotes the idea of taking care of the resources that we have -- and to not take them for granted.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jack is curious and questions the motives of mission control. He's willing to think beyond authoritative directives and do what's best for humanity, even though it's against his orders. He's willing to save someone even after he discovers that she's not who he thought she was. Victoria is dedicated to her work, but she's unwilling to second guess any of her instructions, and she allows jealousy to cloud her instincts. Julia is patient and courageous. Beech is self sacrificing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The drones kill -- instantly incinerating anyone or anything they're programmed to terminate. Several characters die or are injured (including some major characters), but it's not a bloodbath like War of the Worlds. Explosions, hand-to-hand fights, and lots of danger/peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Jack is \"assigned\" to Victoria both romantically and professionally. They shower together, sleep together, kiss several times, and, in one scene, Victoria seduces Jack by undressing (she's shown nude from the back), jumping into a pool and suggestively inviting him to join her. They're shown kissing passionately (he with his shirt off, she naked, with back and legs visible) underwater. Later, another couple kisses; it's implied that they make love, but nothing is shown.\n|Language|: For most of the movie, language isn't very frequent (though what is heard includes \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"bitch\"), but at the very end, there's one memorable use of \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Despite the future setting, there are references to the New York Yankees and bands/songs such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Procol Harum's \"Whiter Shade of Pale.\"\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Jack and Victoria drink with dinner.

Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett star as the leaders of an all-woman heist crew who plan to steal a $150 million diamond necklace during the legendary Met Costume Gala in Manhattan. While you can expect plenty of suspense and tension, there's actually almost no violence (a woman lightly threatens an ex with a shiv). Language is fairly infrequent (words include \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and \"p--sies\"), but there's some drinking and a couple of instances in which a character smokes pot, as well as background cigarette smoking. Characters also flirt and kiss, and one scene shows a woman in lingerie seducing her partner and handcuffing him to his bed. You'll also see tons of brands/products/high-end labels on display. Bottom line? It's the clever planning of the meticulous crime, witty conversation, and tons of high fashion that bring this comedy together. Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson, and Awkwafina co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: The central characters are all thieves/criminals, but they do have their own code of ethics, which includes teamwork, friendship, and looking out for one another.

The diverse cast includes women of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of tension/suspense.

Swearing is occasional, including \"f\u2014k,\" \"s\u2014t,\" \"goddamn,\" \"screwing,\" \"hell.\" In one scene there is a mock racist argument during which characters call one another \"cracker\" and \"colored.\" Sexuality is limited to one kiss as well as a few wide shots of strippers and a lap dance in an upscale nightclub. This film, a loose remake of the 1960 film of the same name, starring Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack, spawned the sequels Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen.\n|Positive Messages|: Basic premise is that a smart, attractive, \"ethical,\"  racially diverse team of swindlers and robbers are heroes while the villain, their mark, is a heartless corporate big shot. So good defeats evil -- but in a nontraditional way.\n|Positive Role Models|: The romantic con artists are loyal, brave, smart, funny, and honorable toward one another. The diverse, colorful team of rogues includes: a Chinese gymnast, two lovable old stereotypical Jewish crooks, and two black criminals. The only substantial female player is the love interest of the gang's leader, Danny Ocean.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's lots of suspense, much of it with a sense of comic irony, as the heroes try to pull off a remarkable robbery. Action includes some fist fights, a beating, chaos in a casino, two security guards being gassed into unconsciousness, and several explosions (two cars and several small rooms blow up). No one is injured or killed. In one scene, an elderly man seems to be having a heart attack or stroke, then appears to be dead (but not for long).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One romantic kiss; several distant shots of strippers, and one short lap dance.

The body count is insanely high -- people are tortured, blown up, shot, and killed in hand-to-hand combat. Plus, a mom dies in a terrible car accident early in the film, and kids and animals are in peril. All of the violence is grisly and cringe-inducingly realistic -- you'll see severed limbs, cracked bones, televised assassinations, and blood splattering everywhere. On the other hand, there's no sex or romance except for a couple of marital kisses, and the language is strong (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole\") but not relentless. The movie definitely bleeds red, white, and blue, but the intense violence is too much for young teens.\n|Positive Messages|: There's a strong patriotic message, though it's wrapped in lots of violence.

Viewers hear bones crunching and see blood spatter, spraying brain matter, and severed limbs as highly trained men kill each other. Washington, D.C., landmarks are destroyed, including the White House and the Washington Monument. The worst moments involve torture and assassination of public officials, including members of the president's Cabinet and basically every Secret Service agent and military official stationed at the White House.

As usual for Tarantino, there are scenes of extremely shocking, graphic violence, including a woman's face being smashed repeatedly against the wall, vicious dog attacks, characters getting burned by a flamethrower, punching, blood spurts, gun use, fighting, and more. Language is also very strong, with tons of uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"c--k,\" and more. There's somewhat explicit sex talk, a scene set at the Playboy Mansion, and scantily clad women. Characters drink and smoke tons of cigarettes (one tinged with acid), and one character wonders whether he might be an alcoholic. The movie is definitely mature, but it's also beautifully made, complex, funny, and smart, though it does mix up fact and fiction.\n|Positive Messages|: No clear messages, but movie offers a chance to think about movies and history and the way movies can change the things that really happened.

He lifts the spirits of the weak, takes steps toward the toppling of a tyrant, and has a lasting effect on those who have been subjected to inhuman treatment.\n|Positive Role Models|: McMurphy is grandly heroic. An outrageous character, he\u2019s loud, assertive, and flaunts all rules and regulations in order to rescue those whom he sees as powerless. The positive role models are the patients, whom despite some unstable, even dangerous behavior, prove to be loyal, compassionate, and honest. In almost every instance, the ward staff is seen as enjoying unrestrained power over the mental patients. Led by the quiet evil of Nurse Ratched, they seem to delight in coercive, patronizing, and even abusive behavior towards those in their care. Senior hospital staff is portrayed as in constant denial, avoiding confrontation, and perpetuating a quiet, untroubled status quo.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Patients intermittently get upset, lose control, and have to be forcibly restrained by staff, sometimes very roughly. There are some violent outbursts, an occasional fight, including one in which a patient attempts to strangle his adversary. A sadistic nurse causes great harm to several of the patients. (Spoiler alert) There are two deaths in the film: one is a bloody victim of suicide, the other dies at the hands of a patient.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No overt sexual activity, however, there is brief partial nudity. There are several sly sexual jokes, as well numerous humorous references to masturbation. One patient discusses his sexual problems. On two occasions female \"party girls\" join the patients and ultimately disappear behind closed doors.\n|Language|: Frequent swearing and obscenities including multiple uses of \"Goddamn,\" \"son-of-a-bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"s--t\", \"c--t,\" \"crap,\" bulls--t,\" \"a--hole,\" many forms of forms of \"f--k\" and more. There are several ethnic and homophobic slurs, usually delivered with a sense of humor, such as: \u201c\"Mormon a--hole,\" \"dumb Indian,\" and \"queer.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Patients smuggle liquor into the ward and drink heavily during a wild and unorthodox party sequence. Characters smoke cigarettes continuously.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776edfad5437001f803cf9": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/onward", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Onward is Pixar's animated fantasy adventure about two elf brothers -- Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and Barley (Chris Pratt) -- whose long-deceased father returns to life for a single day. But when only his bottom half appears, the brothers must go on a thrilling quest to complete the spell that brought him back. They experience peril and danger, go up against fire-breathing creatures, and find themselves in tense situations (like a car chase with angry pixies). The climactic fight scene involves large-scale destruction and sacrifice, but it's somewhat offset by the emotional nature of the brothers' desperation to have some time with their dad. The fact that the plot hinges on a dead father (and his half-body, when it returns) might disturb some young viewers, but ultimately it's more bittersweet than painfully sad. Language is pretty tame and mostly consists of insults (\"weirdo\") and words like \"dang\" and \"what the ... \" (cut off). Two adult characters are in a dating relationship, and another mentions her girlfriend. Families who watch the film are bound to appreciate its messages about teamwork, getting along with siblings, and acting selflessly and courageously.\n|Educational Value|: Not intended as educational, but does teach about role-playing games and medieval fantasy worlds.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes brotherhood, teamwork, perseverance, communication, resilience. Ian and Barley's relationship must overcome differences of opinion and disagreements. Encourages sometimes taking risks, believing in yourself, learning when to be assertive and fierce, acknowledging magic of family love, adventure, trying new things. Suggests that overreliance on technology removes some of the wonder and magic from life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ian is a smart, thoughtful teen who wants, more than anything, to spend time with the father he never knew. Barley is a dedicated, caring, protective older brother who encourages Ian to discover his powers, defends him from dangerous situations. They're both courageous, perseverant. Ian learns to take more risks, while Barley learns value of teamwork, accountability. Their mom, Laurel, is strong, brave, wants the best for her sons, willingly puts herself in dangerous situations to try to help/save them. Even through lens of this being a fantasy world, supporting characters are diverse -- many skin colors, body sizes/types, etc.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Story centers around main characters' deceased father (who died of unspecified illness) coming back to life for one day. Parental death, a common element of children's films, can be upsetting to some viewers. The boys' dad does come back, but only from waist down. His half-body might initially scare really young kids, but it becomes a funny and bittersweet situation. Both Barley and Ian experience sad moments. A climactic fight sequence involves a giant, fire-breathing flying monster that destroys everything in its path, endangers several characters. But (spoiler alert) no one dies or is seriously hurt except for the father (who was already dead). Some peril/tension and creepy settings, including sequence with skeletons, flying arrows, attack by deadly gelatinous cube. The brothers literally choose the Path of Peril at one point. Chase scene in which motorcycle-riding pixies pursue the brothers, sometimes wielding weapons (like a broken-off glass bottle, a mace). Pixies jump on Ian as he tries to drive; van ends up crashing. Characters use a sword. Ian nearly has a fatal fall. Cory the Manticore wrecks her restaurant when she loses her temper, destroying things, spewing fire. A character paralyzes a pawnbroker. Yelling, accusations, arguments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Laurel and her boyfriend, a centaur, are occasionally affectionate. They flirt a little, kiss once, and hug. A ringtone is clearly romantic. Another character mentions her girlfriend.\n|Language|: Occasional insult language like \"screw up,\" \"lazy,\" \"weirdo,\" \"nut,\" \"bonkers,\" and \"beast,\" as well as a couple of dangling exclamations like \"what the ... ,\" \"son of a ... ,\" and \"dang.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the film, but all Disney/Pixar films have off-screen merchandise tie-ins, including apparel, toys, and more. Some real-life products have parody versions in the movie, like a game called Prance Prance Revolution.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A character becomes more and more caffeinated -- excitable, jittery, and fast-talking -- after consuming energy drinks.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768315af944001f1f8f20": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/open-season", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Open Season is a 2006 animated movie in which a tamed bear who ends up in the wild finds his true place. This movie is rife with bathroom humor involving toilets, poop, farts, spit, snot, and underwear. Younger kids will laugh at the obvious stuff and won't get the edgier humor aimed at older audiences. Plays on words such as \"nuts,\" \"Mr. Happy,\" and \"Mr. Weenee\" are abundant. Without the benefit of subtitles, it sounds to some as if a squirrel with a thick Scottish accent is saying \"f--k\" when he's actually saying \"bucktoothed.\" Much of the humor is also rooted in stereotypes of Scottish men and Latinas, as well as groups like hunters and hippies. Some little ones might find the hunting-themed images -- guns, deer strapped to the front of trucks, hunters swarming the woods for fresh meat -- a bit disturbing. There's cartoonish violence throughout. Animals do battle with acorns, porcupine quills, skunk spray, etc. A hunter in a truck tries to run over a deer he had kept strapped to his hood. This hunter is often shown shooting at the characters. A truck gets blown up with a propane gas tank; running gag about rabbits being abused (tossed about, thrown against windows). Also, a bear is shown behaving as if drunk after consuming too much sugar; he stumbles around and slurs his speech and acts as if he's suffering a painful hangover the next day.  On the plus side, the movie might encourage older kids to put themselves in Boog's paws and consider what life is like outside their own neighborhood.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters break into a convenience store and binge on junk food; characters laugh at others' misfortunes; lots of bathroom humor involving toilets, butts, farts, spit, snot, underwear, and defecating. Humor also mined from cultural and ethnic stereotypes in terms of mannerisms and accents. On the plus side, the main characters develop self-reliance and self-respect over the course of the movie, which also has messages about friendship, loyalty, and finding peace in a violent world.\n|Positive Role Models|: The park rangers are the only characters who aren't rooted in at least some stereotyping; they are shown to care for the animals in the wild and enforce the hunting laws for those who poach on the protected lands. Rural hunters portrayed as ignorant and selfish. Humor derived from accents and mannerisms veers very close to stereotyping. A hippie character is perpetually spacey and blissed-out.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence throughout. Animals do battle with acorns, porcupine quills, skunk spray, etc. A hunter in a truck tries to run over a deer he had kept strapped to his hood in an earlier scene. This hunter is often shown shooting at the characters. A truck gets blown up with a propane gas tank; running gag about rabbits being abused (tossed about, thrown against windows); a character has acorns fired at him; wild scene involving characters going over a waterfall.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Double entendre involving sex, flirting.\n|Language|: \"Butt,\" \"bummer,\" \"hairless pink pahookey.\" Some believe the word \"bucktoothed\" mouthed by a character with a Scottish accent sounds like \"f--k.\" In a different scene, animals in the woods call \"fight\" the \"F\" word. Some double entendre involving the use of the word \"nuts\" by a squirrel.\n|Products & Purchases|: Chevy trucks, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, candy items.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Boog is tempted by candy; characters are shown \"high\" on sugar and coffee (\"It's like freedom in a cup!\"); some smoking and drinking among characters.  After consuming too much sugar, Boog behaves like someone drunk on alcohol: stumbling around, slurring his speech, even throwing up.

This is a funny, occasionally crude animated comedy that pits wild animals against domesticated pets in a race to save a conflicted dachshund. There are frequent moments of potty humor. Puns and double entendre with words like \"nuts\" and \"rack\" are abundant. Animals talk of needing \"grown-up time,\" and one dog says to another, \"Your doghouse or mine?\" There are jokes revolving around a dog named \"Mr. Weenie.\" A gas station attendant's rear end crack is exposed. There's a lot of cartoonish pratfall violence. Some of the character voices feel a lot like stereotyping by ethnicity, region, or lifestyle. The trappings of domestication -- leashes, treats, RVs -- are presented as entrapment, at least from the perspective of the \"wilds.\" But it ultimately delivers a nice message about the devotion between pets and their owners. While it might be helpful to see the original before viewing this, it's not imperative -- kids will still be able to follow along with the action.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a story of very different creatures working together as a team to achieve goals. There are also lessons in forgiveness and finding out what's really important; that is, being with the ones we love and the ones who love us. On the other hand, much of the humor comes from either engaging in or coming very close to engaging in stereotypes of ethnicity, region, and lifestyle.\n|Positive Role Models|: The animals make lots of jokes concerning flatulence, urination, defecation. While they do work together, no characters emerge as clear positive role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Rabbits are used like snowballs in a snowball fight. Scene of a dog getting electrocuted. Cartoonish pratfall violence: animals falling and losing their antlers, a gas station explodes.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: For a movie that starts with an animal wedding, there is very little romance.

There's also some name calling and potty language (\"butt\" and \"poop\" etc.).\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Although in the end, a male character realizes how important family is, the movie's plot focuses on going on \"guy\" trips and having \"guy\" friendships -- which plays into mixed messages about gender roles and the value of family (family obligations are depicted as a drag for the male characters, though not the females).\n|Positive Role Models|: Some gender stereotyping -- male characters are somewhat buffoonish, and female characters are smart and organized. For example, Elliot's wife Giselle is the whistle blower and the character that everyone depends on to bring order to the community.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Bunnies are tossed around for sport.

Still, there's no shortage of iffy-for-younger-viewers material, starting with the premise: Three women (played by Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, and Kate Upton) form an offbeat friendship when they all realize they've been seeing the same man (one is actually married to him). Despite a plot revolving around cheating/infidelity, the messages that come through the strongest are the ones related to the women's friendship (which based on mutual respect) and mission (righting a wrong). Expect lots of innuendo/frank talk about sex (though no nudity) and relationships, kissing, scantily clad women and men, a little blood (a character walks into a glass door), swearing (mostly \"s--t\" and \"a--hole\"), some toilet humor (poop, vomit), and frequent social drinking, sometimes to excess.\n|Positive Messages|: Three women thrown together by unusual circumstances -- they were all seeing the same man (and one's married to him) -- manage to direct their anger at the actual perpetrator, the philanderer, rather than at each other. Instead of competing for his attentions, they empower each other and form a deep, hilarious friendship. Lots of toilet humor (diarrhea, dog poop, vomit).\n|Positive Role Models|: Carly is a strong, self-possessed woman who won't let a man define her or set the romantic agenda. She helps Kate find her own voice in a lie-filled relationship. Kate, for her part, taps into a deep well of forgiveness for Carly and Amber, fixing her anger on the man who wronged them, not at the women (who were also deceived) and, more importantly, not at herself.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman wreaks havoc on a room with a golf club. A man walks into a glass window, breaking his nose (the scene turns bloody fast), then proceeds to run through and shatter a glass cubicle wall. He then gets punched in the face. A woman tackles another.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of innuendo. Frank talk about waxing private parts and the frequency with which a couple has sex. Passionate kissing and groping. A man walks around in a towel. A bikini-clad woman's body is frequently shown in close-up (lingering on breasts and bottom), with characters discussing her appeal.\n|Language|: Many uses of \"s--t\" (and the related \"bulls--t\"), plus \"a--hole,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"pu--y.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Labels are flashed to denote characters' affluence, including Mercedes Benz.

Viewers can expect profanity and sexual banter, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"jerking off,\" \"d--khead,\" \"a--holes,\" and more. A man and woman undressing and passionately kissing are interrupted in a comic moment (a brief look at a male backside). A monogamous gay relationship is depicted respectfully. Lead characters drink alcohol in several sequences; in some instances it results in mild inebriation, in others drunkenness. Though Otherhood's MPAA \"R\" rating seems a bit harsh, the movie will have little appeal for most kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Advocates for open, honest communication between parents and kids, reevaluating those relationships as they mature. Comments upon need for women to adjust goals as life changes occur. Values promoted: respect for others (including their choices), teamwork, compassion, courage, importance of friends. \"Think more about what you say and less about what you feel.\" A gay couple is treated respectfully and without judgment.\n|Positive Role Models|: Central characters are evolving throughout.

It's an unflinching examination of terminal illness and shows Nicole in her final stages: frail, in excruciating pain, and in the throes of psychosis. Viewers also see earlier times in her life, including the trajectory of her marriage to Matt (Casey Affleck), from affection and sudsy shared showers (nothing graphic shown) to contention, matters of infidelity, and ultimately his role as an exhausted nurse to her. But through it all, love is always present. While the story is focused on adults, Nicole and Matt's 10-year-old daughter expresses her anger at the situation. It's morose, but the light is the couple's extraordinary friend, Dane (Jason Segel), who shows up to help temporarily and ends up staying for more than a year, giving up his own life to help them through a terrible time. Swearing (\"s--t,\" \"f--k,\" etc.) permeates the film, and characters drink beer, but the biggest issue here is that a story about losing a parent may be scary and too emotionally taxing for kids.\n|Positive Messages|: The film is a demonstration of profound friendship. Love isn't just feeling, it's doing. The point is also made that people are more than the job or money they have. Themes include compassion, courage, gratitude, integrity, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dane is selfless, generous, supportive, and compassionate.

Characters drink, smoke, get in fights, harass schoolchildren, use knives and guns, and commit murder. One character is severely burned and dies. Additionally, the film deals frankly with class stratification. A teen girl rejects the drunken sexual advances of her boyfriend while they're at a drive-in movie theater. At this same drive-in, a clearly drunk teen raises the skirt of a teen girl, exposing her panties. A \"greaser\" teen asks a teen girl with red hair, in so many words, if her pubic hair is the same color. Occasional profanity includes \"damn,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"bastards,\" and \"wiseass,\" and expect to see the middle-finger gesture. Note: The original cut of the movie was rated PG in 1983, before the PG-13 rating existed. The edited/extended cut released in 2003 carries the PG-13 rating.\n|Positive Messages|: Through their experiences, some of the characters begin to question, and in some ways reject, the shallow divisiveness of high school cliques. Characters resort to violence as a solution to their problems, with consequences.\n|Positive Role Models|: While the circumstances are not the best, it's strongly implied that Ponyboy has changed for the better as a result of his experiences as a \"greaser\" from the wrong side of the tracks in constant battle with the \"Soc\" rich kids on the other side of town.

The story's central theme is forgiveness, which is demonstrated on many levels -- the greatest of which is God's atonement of man's sins through Jesus' death and resurrection. Other themes include compassion, humility, and communication. The movie's purpose is evangelical, and a student who feels tormented by her parents' poor decisions finds immediate comfort once she's saved. There's no sex, swearing, or violence in this message movie, but it does deal with drug addiction: A character's past with drugs is a plot point, and there are references to a young mother who died from a drug overdose. While the casting is diverse, there are some stereotypes, like a Black family with a teen who steals, meth-addicted parents, and a father who abandons his baby. The White family, meanwhile, is depicted as pretty close to perfect and facilitates turning the Black family's life around.\n|Positive Messages|: Themes of forgiveness and humility. Heavy Christian messaging includes overcoming obstacles by finding strength and identity through God. Evangelical messaging includes that once someone accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior, then they get a clean slate. Other themes include compassion, humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Diversity in casting. A Black female principal is portrayed as a positive, strong, involved leader. However, most other Black characters cling to uncomfortable clich\u00e9s, such as a father who abandons his baby, and characters involved in illegal activities like stealing, drugs. Story edges into \"White savior\" territory. A married couple demonstrates excellent conflict resolution/communication skills.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man vents frustration by smashing a brick on the ground.

While it pays tribute to the original film, the main character this time is an adult, rather than a girl, and the themes are accordingly more mature. For much of the movie, Oz (James Franco) is a selfish, egotistical ladies' man; he flirts to get his way and ends up kissing four different characters. (He also says \"damn\" a couple of times.) And if the Wicked Witch's flying monkeys in the 1939 classic frightened your kids, the flying baboons in this prequel may terrify them, as will the general cruelty of the evil characters and the plight of the orphaned China Girl. Glinda is also briefly tortured (via magical lightning), and there's an intense twister scene and several \"jump\" moments that are especially startling in the 3-D version. The Wicked Witch's transformation is creepy, though ultimately she doesn't look quite as scary as the original. On the bright side, the movie offers a lasting lesson about how teamwork and friendship between unlikely allies can overcome obstacles and how a person's legacy lives on in people's hearts and minds.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite the overwhelming odds against them, Oz, his friends, and the good people of Oz band together to save the land from evil. There's a recurring emphasis on the idea that when you believe (in yourself, in others, in a dream), anything is possible, as well as the notion that people can change for the better if they're given the chance -- and others' trust. Evil characters are driven by vengeance and jealousy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both Glinda and Annie see vast potential in Oz, even if he's a self-described con-man magician who -- at least at first -- is quick to take advantage of others and put his own selfish interests above all else. Glinda is optimistic, self-sacrificing, and wise; China Girl and Finley are faithful companions who teach Oz the meaning of unconditional friendship. The wizard rises to the occasion to save the people of Oz, and even at the end, he offers the Wicked Witch a chance to redeem herself.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The flying monkeys are now flying, screeching baboons with big talons, and they can be downright terrifying, especially in 3-D. Early in the film, the circus strong man chases and tries to beat up Oz; the twister scene that follows is intense (this is another instance where 3-D ups the intensity, with sharp projectiles flying toward Oz, objects hurtling through storm clouds, etc.). Glinda is tortured (via magic) and must battle her evil enemies, who look quite scary and can be frighteningly wicked. China Town and all its inhabitants are mostly destroyed, and the orphaned China Girl is left with broken legs. One main character's transformation into the Wicked Witch of the West is freaky, although she's not as ugly as the original Wicked Witch. The wizard navigates some intense river rapids upon his initial arrival in Oz, plummeting down a scary waterfall, and he's later charged by a hungry lion and attacked by fierce piranha-like plants (again, scary in 3-D). Theodora hurls fireballs when her temper flares, and angry tears leave scars on her cheeks. China Girl briefly wields a knife in one scene (played for humor); soldiers use spears. Scenes in the Dark Forest include creepy eyes and a spooky graveyard. One scene near the end briefly suggests the death of a main character.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Oz is quite the womanizer; he kisses four different women over the course of the movie, and there are a few innuendos about his various conquests. Theodora wears what looks like a corset top in one scene; earlier, she's shown wearing very tight leather pants and a jacket. The Wicked Witch is fairly busty as well. Oz's treatment of women is the cause of a lot of anger and destruction.\n|Language|: \"Damn\" is used a couple of times; also \"shut up.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Although the movie itself contains no product/brand references outside of the book and classic film, Disney has merchandise partnerships with everything from makeup and apparel companies to stationery and games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In the Kansas section, a clown drinks from a flask during Oz's magic performance.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776830f54112001f5bcd25": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ps-i-love-you", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that, contrary to what the ad campaign might have you believe, this is a somewhat sad movie that deals with loss and grief -- not a straightforward romantic comedy. Its messages -- tell the people you care about that you love them before it's too late, and live life to the fullest -- are admirable, and its characters are goodhearted. But there's a fair amount of strong language (no \"f--k,\" though there's plenty of \"s--t\" and \"goddamn\"), some frank talk about sex, and partial nudity. The movie also seems obsessed with getting the main character, Holly, hooked up with another man, as if that's the only fix for the widowed heart.\n|Positive Messages|: A woman sizes up men by their physical attributes (and talks loudly about it); friends fight and ignore each other or yell at each other on voicemail; a couple threatens to walk out on each other; a man's Tourette Syndrome is sometimes played for laughs.

It's full of mature themes and violent scenes (including the bloody death of a child) -- in fact, it opens on the face of a child who has been hurt, her mouth bleeding. The villain is a captain in the fascist military who repeatedly brutalizes others: He berates his wife, threatens his stepdaughter, kills villagers (beating them and shooting point-blank), and tortures his servant. Weapons include guns, knives, and grenades; some violent acts are explicit on screen (pain and bloody wounds visible). Some of the creatures Ofelia meets are frightening: The giant toad, the Faun, and the Pale Man are all strange, noisy, and physically threatening. Language includes two uses of \"f--k.\"\n|Positive Messages|: The captain is strict and brutal, abusing his wife, stepdaughter, local community members, and his servants; Ofelia makes some mistakes (she dirties her party dress, steals food without considering the consequences, etc.), but she's morally sound and a courageous girl; the rebels mean to save the community/nation, but they must sneak around to resist the dominant state forces.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Ofelia appears wounded and bleeding from her mouth as film begins; the fascist captain commits brutal acts (shooting unarmed \"rebels,\" torturing sympathetic characters when they become suspects, threatening Ofelia); Carmen almost miscarries, her blood-covered body frightening Ofelia; after he's attacked with a knife, the captain stitches his wound closed, showing great pain and lots of blood; battles include shooting, explosions, and bloody wounds; a scary giant toad and the eyeless Pale Man threaten Ofelia (latter chases her through a bone-filled cavern with arms waving and attacks her friends the fairies, to bloody effect).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Ofelia's mother submits physically to her new husband, though the abusiveness is never sexual, per se (the concern here is gendered behavior); prepubescent Ofelia remains sexually innocent throughout the film, though she is \"seduced\" (in an abstract way) by the sinuous, strange faun.\n|Language|: Some infrequent language (all in subtitles), including \"assholes,\" \"f--k\" and \"f--ked up,\" \"hell,\" \"bitch,\" and \"son of a bitch.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink wine with dinner; Ofelia concocts a kind of \"potion\" with a living root.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684c8a7581001f130023": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/paranormal-activity", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Paranormal Activity is a real chill-up-the-spine movie that's bound to induce nightmares in plenty of young moviegoers -- even though, as with The Blair Witch Project, the big buzz around the movie (and the prospect of testing their backbone) will likely prove irresistible to many teens. The movie takes its cues from many classic horror films in that it only suggests the scary stuff rather than actually showing explicit gore and violence -- but in leaving much to the viewer's imagination, the effect is much, much more psychologically terrifying than any regular blood-fest. Expect frequent strong language (including multiple uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t\") and some sex talk.\n|Positive Messages|: The main characters' plight is unexplained -- they don't seem to have done anything to \"deserve\" what they go through. Unfortunately, they also can't agree on the methods or approaches to deal with it, and so most of their work is for naught. But they demonstrate some definite bravery in standing up to the beast.\n|Positive Role Models|: Micah isn't much of a role model, despite his bravery in trying to face and fight the demon. He constantly disagrees and argues with Katie and often refuses to listen when she asks him for help. He tries to fight the demon in an aggressive, physical way, even though it's clear that it's not going to work. But on the plus side, Katie exhibits definite courage, strength, and good humor in the face of her harrowing problem.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A simmering violence constantly threatens but rarely cuts loose onscreen -- there's actually very little physical violence, with only the tiniest hint of blood or gore. Micah and Katie argue often.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young adult couple that lives together talks and jokes about sex fairly often. They both walk around the house in sleeping clothes, consisting of boxer shorts, T-shirts, and tank tops. A female guest shows off her bare midriff. The camera sometimes emphasizes Katie's ample cleavage. The couple has sex one time, but it happens off camera.\n|Language|: Very liberal use of \"f--k\" in all its variations, including name-calling (directed toward the invading demon).

While hardly any violence is shown on screen (most of the scary moments involve loud noises and sudden movements), tension and fear are constant, and -- as in the original -- the viewer's imagination provides most of the fright. There's off-screen violence involving a dog, a toddler is put in mild peril, and one character's neck is snapped. Language is fairly infrequent but strong; it includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t\" and \"p---y.\" Teens who survived the original will most likely want to see this one, too.\n|Positive Messages|: These terrible things begin happening to this family -- presumably -- because of something an ancestor did; there's no sense of justice. During the crisis, the family works hard to protect the new baby, but at the same time, they don't seem able to work together. The father refuses to believe that anything is wrong. Toward the end of the story, the father makes a hard, cruel decision, which winds up biting him back.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dan refuses to believe his wife and daughter when they say that something is wrong in the house, and he fires the nanny when she tries to perform a cleansing ritual.

The scary stuff is left largely to the imagination (and there's a near-constant sense of dread as a result), though this movie has a little more on-screen violence than the previous films did: An invisible force terrorizes two young girls, lifting one up by the hair and dragging her across the floor. Language is strong but not frequent and includes many uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" A loving couple attempts to tape themselves having sex, though they only get as far as some foreplay, with clothes on.

It's a complicated, unlikely story spun as a fanciful tale: The parents have lied to their kids, neither twin is aware of the other's existence, and each has been kept from one parent for eleven years. Deceit plays an important part in the movie's plot (albeit all in the name of family togetherness). Wine is consumed in several scenes, and the twins' mother gets slightly drunk before she faces her ex-husband. An ear-piercing scene results in an \"ewww\" moment, and a poker game results in a girl's embarrassing naked dive into a lake (a very wide shot).\n|Educational Value|: Kids will get an introductory look at some differences between two cultures: American and English.

In one comic sequence, a woman falls into a lake, then reacts to a small lizard on her head and in her mouth. A few scenes with somewhat mean-spirited teasing among young campers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some warm kisses and embraces between adults.

It takes on thought-provoking themes like loneliness, agency, identity, and mortality (as well as courage), and it all hinges on a decision that one character makes without another's ability to weigh in, removing her ability to make her own life choices. A spaceship has a massive mechanical failure that threatens the lives of those on board. Viewers see it play out in large-scale accidents, including a scene in which a character nearly drowns. You can also expect sex scenes (naked buttocks shown, but nothing more graphic), kissing/making out, and some swearing (\"s--t,\" \"damn,\" etc.) and drinking -- sometimes to excess.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes courage and forgiveness, which can lead to closure. But the decision that one character makes completely takes away another's choices/power.\n|Positive Role Models|: Aurora is open, adventurous, and willing to ask herself difficult questions. To a certain extent, Jim is, too, but he also makes a decision for her that she might never have wanted, forever altering her life (in other words, this isn't a \"girl power\" story).\n|Violence & Scariness|: A spaceship has a massive mechanical failure that threatens the lives of those on board.

His side is pierced with a spear. Two other men are crucified and one's eyes are pecked out. There are other disturbing images, including the character of Satan and some grotesque children who taunt Judas. We also see Judas commit suicide by hanging.

While characters demonstrate courage and sacrifice, the movie is extremely, unrelentingly violent, with many graphic battle scenes. A character shoots himself in the head after his family is killed. A solider is decapitated by a cannonball; other soldiers lose their limbs to cannonballs. There's blood and gore throughout, as characters fight with muskets, rifles, swords, cannons, and hatchets. Dead Black people are shown hanging from a tree, and dozens of characters are burned to death while locked in a church. The atrocities committed in a past battle are vividly described. Other than the violence, there's some use of words like \"hell\" and \"damn,\" and characters drink wine and whiskey and use chewing tobacco. Characters kiss, and there are gentle sexual references in a scene depicting the colonial custom of \"bundling bags\" for courting couples.\n|Positive Messages|: The colonists' fight for independence promotes the value of heroism, courage, and sacrifice. Other messages include the importance of standing up for what you believe in and that you can't escape the wrongs you've done in the past. The film has been called out for ignoring the realities of slavery in the American colonies during this period.\n|Positive Role Models|: Benjamin is portrayed as a reluctant hero who displays tremendous courage and bravery when he feels he ultimately has no choice but to fight. His son Gabriel also displays courage and valor in the face of profound loss and cares enough for the cause of liberty to be willing to die for it. The members of the militia led by Benjamin are citizens from all backgrounds who put their lives at risk for what they believe in. A racist man who initially believes that Black men shouldn't be soldiers, much less earn their freedom by serving in the Continental Army, changes his mind when his life is saved due to the bravery of the Black soldier in his militia. That said, the movie essentially ignores the facts of slavery in the American colonies during this time, including that the real person Benjamin's character was based on was an enslaver (as were many of the United States' founders).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent, explicit, unrelenting battle violence. Fighting with muskets, rifles, swords, hatchets. Blood and gore. A solider is decapitated by a cannonball; other soldiers lose limbs from cannonballs. A man shoots himself in the head after finding his wife and child murdered in front of his home. Black characters are shown hanging dead from a tree. A horse is killed when stabbed in its underbelly with the spear of a flagpole. Dozens of characters are burned to death while locked in a church. Injured soldiers' limbs are hacked off by battlefield surgeons. Talk of eating dogs. The lead character discusses the atrocities he committed while a soldier: He hacked dozens of the enemy into little pieces and kept two survivors alive to bring the dismembered remains to their superior officers.

Like the show, the movie focuses on human boy Ryder (voiced by Will Brisbin) and his extraordinary pack of puppy hero friends, who must rally to save their town's neighboring city from greedy, cat-loving, dog-hating Mayor Humdinger (Ron Pardo). After a call from observant puppy pal Liberty (Marsai Martin), the PAW Patrol -- including Chase (Iain Armitage), Rubble (Keegan Hedley), Rocky (Callum Shoniker), and Skye (Lilly Bartlam) -- head from Adventure Bay to neighboring Adventure City, where Humdinger is wreaking havoc with his selfish plans. The movie has slightly more peril and cartoon violence than the show -- mostly humans and pets stuck in vehicles or buildings that are about to collapse or crash -- but it continues to promote positive messages about courage, perseverance, teamwork, and problem-solving. The supporting voice cast includes Kim Kardashian West, Jimmy Kimmel, Randall Park, Tyler Perry, Yara Shahidi, and Dax Shepard.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, but audiences will learn life lessons about courage and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie, like show it's based on, focuses on perseverance, teamwork, believing in yourself, learning from your mistakes, and helping/rescuing people. The pups each bring different talents to the crew and all work together during every emergency.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ryder is a loyal, brave leader. He cares for and encourages each of the pups. As in the series, Chase initially doubts himself and deals with anxiety but eventually shows leadership. Liberty is plucky and brave, proves herself worthy of a spot on the team. The pups know how to work together and use their specific gifts to help the residents of Adventure City and to stop Mayor Humdinger from his nefarious plans.\n|Diverse Representations|: Most of the main characters are talking dogs, but humans include a few racially/ethnically diverse supporting characters. Most PAW Patrol dogs are male, with Skye (clad, of course, in pink) providing female representation. A new character, Liberty, helps bring more gender parity to the team.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some perilous moments include people/pets in vehicles that are about to crash or buildings about to collapse.

Hank (voiced by Michael Cera) is a dog who wants nothing more than to become a samurai, even though that honor is always bestowed upon cats. He ends up assigned to defend an all-cat village and convinces a retired samurai named Jimbo (Samuel L. Jackson) to become his mentor. The adventure is mostly appropriate for families with younger kids but does include lots of martial arts-based cartoon violence -- some of it with weapons. There's also rude/potty humor (jokes about flatulence, burping, butts, spay and neutering) and insult language (\"idiot,\" \"imbecile,\" \"dimwits,\" \"suck,\" etc.). One line, \"mother cocker spaniel,\" sounds a bit like Jackson's infamous cursing. Catnip is depicted as an addictive substance that can be abused, and a major character is portrayed as being dependent on it. Although the movie isn't educational in nature, its themes encourage courage, empathy, and teamwork, as well as tolerance and acceptance.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Promotes tolerance, acceptance, teamwork, empathy, and courage for the greater good, as well as redemption, forgiveness, and moving forward after a mistake. The village learns to trust an outsider, work together, and defend themselves despite the odds.\n|Positive Role Models|: Hank is brave and willing to learn. Jimbo is willing to take Hank under his tutelage as a samurai in training. Emiko is a brave young cat who wants to help defend her town.\n|Diverse Representations|: Although the movie is about cats and (one) dog, the story has parallels about humans from different cultures or countries who experience discrimination when they are in the minority in a new place. Plays into clich\u00e9s related to samurai and ninja culture.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Ika Chu sends waves of assassins, ninjas, and fighters to terrorize the villagers and threaten Hank. Homes are destroyed, and cats are injured. Big martial arts-style fights involve characters using weapons; a climactic battle sequence involves an overflowing giant toilet. Flashback to what starts as a menacing scene full of potential threats but ends up being a party. Comment about how a samurai accidentally spayed and neutered his boss's in-laws. Threats about how \"curiosity kills cats.\"\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sumo-wrestling cat's butt cheeks are visible. Accidental cat nudity. A joking \"you look hot.\" A quick kiss at a nightclub/party.\n|Language|: Insult language includes \"morons,\" \"imbeciles,\" \"selfish idiot,\" \"suck,\" \"brainless,\" \"washed-up loser,\" \"dimwit,\" \"pre-diabetic who drinks too much,\" and one in-joke about Samuel L. Jackson's characters' infamy for strong language when Jimbo says \"mother cocker spaniel.\" Potty humor involving \"cut the cheese,\" farting, burping, and a giant toilet (the \"super bowl\"). Hurtful \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign. Although never referenced as such, the town's name sounds like \"poops a lot\" in Spanish.\n|Products & Purchases|: Reference to Mentos. Off-screen merchandise tie-ins to apparel, toys, games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Catnip extract is depicted as an addictive substance like alcohol, and Jimbo acts high/drunk on it and is shown overindulging in it more than once. It becomes a plot point: Jimbo hits the catnip too hard when he feels like a failure.

Charlie Brown is still his same awkward, insecure self -- and Lucy is still rude and yells a lot -- but there's less of the insult language (\"stupid,\" \"blockhead\") than in the classic specials, and there's no mistaking the movie's positive messages about being yourself, trying hard, and liking people for who they really are. Many characters have crushes on others (Charlie Brown blushes around the Little Red-Haired Girl, Sally calls Linus her \"sweet babboo,\" Lucy flings herself at Schroeder, etc.), and you can expect aerial dogfights and peril in Snoopy's World War I flying ace fantasy sequences (which may feel even more intense in 3D), but it's nothing that most older preschoolers/younger grade schoolers won't be able to handle. Charlie Brown shakes his bottom briefly during a dance scene, and his clothes fall off as the result of one of his many comic pratfalls, but overall the movie has a slightly softer edge (and more upbeat tone) than some of the older specials.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but offers valuable lessons about friendship and self-confidence. Snoopy's fantasy sequences could introduce interested kids to a bit of World War I history.\n|Positive Messages|: Believe in yourself, and be true to who you are; it may not always feel like it, but people see and appreciate the real you. As long as you try your hardest and persevere, it doesn't matter whether you're the best at something. It's important to be liked for who you are. Be kind and compassionate. If you want to get to know someone, talk to them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Charlie Brown repeatedly talks about being insecure and a failure (\"everything I try turns out wrong,\" \"I'm nothing\"), but it's very clear that he's really compassionate, honest, brave, helpful, and an all-around nice guy. He worries a lot but keeps trying new ways to improve himself and get the Little Red-Haired Girl to see the real him. Snoopy is extremely confident. Many of the supporting characters are true to their comic strip personas -- Lucy is often brusque and rude, Sally is flighty, Linus is serious, etc. -- but with slightly softer edges.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Snoopy's World War I flying ace fantasy sequences include airplane dogfights, bullets, storms, crashes, and peril. Many slapstick moments/pratfalls as Charlie Brown wrestles with a kite, plays hockey, learns to dance, rides an out-of-control sled, etc.; some cause breakage/mess/chaos. Lucy yells at Charlie Brown.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of puppy-love crushes -- Charlie Brown blushes over the Little Red-Haired Girl, Sally calls Linus her \"sweet babboo,\" Lucy always tries to get Schroeder to notice her, Peppermint Patty thinks Charlie Brown is flirting with her, etc. Snoopy \"kisses\" Lucy. Snoopy's fantasy sequences include the \"love of his life,\" French poodle Fifi. One of Charlie Brown's falls knocks his clothes off; he shakes his butt when performing the \"Chicken Dance\" song.\n|Language|: A couple uses each of \"stupid\" and \"blockhead.\" Also \"dumb\" and \"slug\" (as in \"to hit\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing within the movie, but there are tons of tie-in products available (toys, clothes, books, and much more).

The movie features extended and intense battle violence with thousands of casualties, including characters we care about. Soldiers use profanity (\"son of a bitch,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"t-tties,\" \"damn\") and joke about seduction techniques. A couple decides not to have sex because they don't want to have any regrets. Another couple does have sex, and the woman becomes pregnant. There is some drinking and drunkenness. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a real-life hero of World War II, the first black man to win the Navy Cross. It's worth mentioning that the movie attempts to show Japan not just as \"the enemy,\" but also as soldiers and leaders who had families and loved ones who were somewhat ambivalent about launching the attack. In one scene, an injured American soldier yells that he doesn't want to be treated by a \"Jap\" -- his prejudice the smallest hint of the Japanese-American internment camps that, for all the heroism and sacrifice in so many other ways, would be one of the most shameful aspects of American involvement in World War II.\n|Positive Messages|: Both sides of the Pearl Harbor attack are shown; care is taken to show the Japanese motives for launching the surprise attack. All the patriotic heartstrings are pulled with every trick in the Hollywood playbook, but what emerges is a strong sense of the people who fought at Pearl Harbor and in World War II, their bravery in defending America from fascism, making the event come to life from the pages of history.\n|Positive Role Models|: The pilots at Pearl Harbor who later flew in the Doolittle raid that surprised Japan and restored morale to an America devastated by the losses at Pearl Harbor are shown to be brave and selfless in the interests of defending their country. Franklin Delano Roosevelt is shown to be a commanding and decisive leader, demanding more than what the military brass say is possible in the weeks after Pearl Harbor. Tells the story of the first African-American man to earn the Naval Cross.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense battle scenes, many injuries and deaths, some graphic. Sailors on battleships shown drowning, burning, falling off the ships as they capsize and sink. Plane crashes. Hospital blood, intense injuries -- a nurse places her fingers into the neck wound of a man profusely bleeding. Gunfights between American and Japanese soldiers, grenades thrown. A disheveled farmer hits his son and knocks him to the ground; the boy's best friend strikes the farmer with a two-by-four.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some innuendo between female nurses and male pilots. Nonsexual male nudity when nurses give shots in the buttocks in the infirmary. A couple decides not to have sex because they don't want to have any regrets.

There's not much iffy content (a bit of drinking and innuendo is the bulk of it), and the main character is devoted to discovering her own identity and making peace with her circumstances, though it's sometimes hard for her to overcome her shame. Her parents -- especially her mother -- can't seem to accept her as she is, which could be upsetting for some younger viewers. But in the end (naturally), everything wraps up nicely.\n|Positive Messages|: Men -- and most of society, for that matter -- shun a woman for looking different. A man lies to get the chance to make money to pay gambling debts. A reporter devotes himself to digging up dirt that destroys a family. A main character runs away, hurting those left behind. A mother fixates on her daughter's looks. All of that said, though, the film has lots of heart.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Men are cruel to Penelope when they see her face to face, and a guard has to tackle some of the suitors who run away. Max has a screaming fight with Lemon, who, in an earlier scene, gets injured for being too zealous at his scandal-seeking job.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of romance, but no sex (at least none shown).

Expect lots of explosions and chase scenes -- by plane, gondola, pest control truck, etc. -- that put the penguins in frequent peril; at one point, the team fears that one of their members has been killed. The penguins are fighting a team of evil octopi that are killed in different ways. There's a bit of crude humor (a penguin is cursed with a \"butt hand\") and one small, mild romantic subplot, but kids who like action, the Madagascar movies, and the penguins' TV show will enjoy the movie. Plus, there are positive messages about not judging others based on their appearance, as well as loyalty and bravery under pressure.\n|Educational Value|: Kids may learn a bit about penguins in the wild.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't judge others by their appearance. Private is adorable, but there's much more to him -- Skipper realizes that it's not what you look like but what you do that counts. Other themes include loyalty and bravery under pressure.\n|Positive Role Models|: Private wants everyone to realize what a valued member of the team he really is. Skipper says that what someone looks like doesn\u2019t matter -- it's what they do. Skipper and the team look out for each other and care for others no matter the cost. On the downside, there's only one female character in the movie, and she's a love interest who has few lines.\n|Violence & Scariness|: At one point the penguins think that Private has been killed. Lots of chases/explosions/scenes of peril. The penguins are kidnapped by an evil scientist that turns out to be an evil octopus plotting to kidnap all of the world's penguins. Penguins are put in cages like jails. The penguins fight octopi. A monster penguin eats a baby kitten, then spits it out. The penguins get sucked out of a plane, are trapped on a boat with no food or water, and are turned into monsters.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kowalski has a love interest, Eva the owl. He follows her around, and she kisses him in one of the last scenes. His face has lipstick marks all over it.\n|Language|: Pop culture references take the place of swear words (like \"Parker Posey!\"). \"It's flipping useless\" in reference to flippers. After the penguins get transformed into monsters, one has a \"butt hand\" -- a hand coming out of his butt (they explain it in case it wasn't clear).\n|Products & Purchases|: The penguins eat brandless cheese poofs.

Young hero Percy is now in high school rather than middle school; his satyr friend Grover loves the ladies; and a trip that Percy, Grover, and Annabeth take to a casino has a nightclub, a full bar, and trippy lotus flowers that all the patrons ingest (in the book, they play video and arcade games endlessly). Plus, the violence level is high for a PG-rated movie: Monsters are very frightning, especially the demonic ones -- like Hades aflame with skeletal wings and a fury sent to destroy Percy -- characters (monster and human) are impaled and slashed at with swords, and Percy's mom is crushed by a minotaur and taken to the underworld. After Medusa's head is severed, it's dragged along on the road trip to Hades.\n|Positive Messages|: Along with all the positive messages of family loyalty and perseverance, comes the negatives: absentee parents, disobedient teens, teens who express dislike of their parents, and some rewards for negative behavior.  The underworld depicted seems like a place of torment for everyone. There's also some very reckless teen driving -- Grover falls asleep at the wheel and almost gets hit by a semi, and later teens speed down the freeway in a sports car.\n|Positive Role Models|: Percy is a poor student coping with dyslexia and ADHD who discovers his heroic qualities. He also adores his mom and does everything to save her. While Grover is a good friend, he's also played as a womanizer. Annabeth is a strong female character who's great with a sword. But the fierce friendship that these three forge makes a much stronger impression in the book.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Battles with some mythological monsters are quite frightening. Some creatures are also demonic-looking -- like a gruesome fury, a giant Hades with skeletal wings coming out of a campfire, and scores of tormented fiery souls. Others are just large and violent, like a minotaur and a hydra with many snapping, fire-breathing heads. Medusa's head of snakes is severed and carted around. A car is thrown, limbs are hacked by swords, and two characters -- one monster, one human -- are impaled violently. There's lots of fighting amongst campers, with some blood (though Percy magically heals in water).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Gabe slaps Percy's mom's behind in front of Percy. Grover is all about the ladies -- he has a horde around him at a casino and asks jokingly, \"Which one did I propose to?\" after he tells Percy he's getting married. Persephone kisses Hades passionately, then turns her attentions to Grover saying, \"I haven't had a satyr [pause] visit before.\"\n|Language|: \"Ass\" a few times. \"Highway to Hell\" plays on the radio as the characters head for the underworld. A few uses of \"God\" as an exclamation. Plus insults like \"bald-headed freak\" and \"little brat\" exchanged between Percy and his stepfather.\n|Products & Purchases|: Converse All-Stars should have their own credit (even though the kind with wings that the movie's characters fight in aren't for sale). An iPod is also an important part of the story. Also shown: a Mac laptop and a sports car. Plus shout-outs to The French Connection (original) and Mick Jagger.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lotus flowers at the Lotus Casino are offered constantly to guests; they have a mind-altering effect that make patrons loopy and unaware of the outside world. Gabe drinks beer or asks for a beer in every one of his scenes. There are fruity-looking drinks at a bar in the Lotus Casino around teens.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768ba9ab54400214eab5c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/percy-jackson-sea-of-monsters", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is the sequel to Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief -- both of which are based on Rick Riordan's best-selling fantasy book series. Riordan's action- and humor-packed tales are enormously popular with elementary-school readers, but, like its predecessor, this big-screen adaptation does include violence and peril-filled scenes (and a few presumed deaths) that could scare younger kids -- even if they're familiar with the story. Unlike the first movie, there aren't any inappropriate references to sexy women or relationships. Ultimately, this is a hero's journey in which a main character and his friends save each other and defeat evil.\n|Positive Messages|: Percy's quest teaches that, in order to overcome obstacles, you need help, support, and guidance from friends, mentors, and people who know more than you. Percy must persevere despite his self doubt in order to protect his friends and his home. Tyson is a cyclops but not bloodthirsty like other cyclops; he makes it clear that you shouldn't judge someone before you get to know them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are fiercely protective of one another. Percy conquers his self doubt to act like a leader and make tough decisions to save Camp Half Blood. Tyson immediately cares for Percy and loves having a brother. Tyson is self sacrificing and kind.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of fantasy action. A flashback shows a young girl being killed by a cyclops and then turned into the roots of a magical tree. A giant Colchis Bull wreaks havoc on Camp Half Blood, where it injures several kids before fighting directly with both Percy and Tyson. There are three big fight scenes between Percy and his friends and the bad guys. Polyphemus, a huge cyclops, keeps threatening to eat either satyrs or half bloods and fights with Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson. When brought back to life, Kronos is a frightening sight. Two characters are presumed dead -- and one does temporarily die before the golden fleece revives her.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some discussion of how the gods have children with humans and other creatures. Percy and Annabeth share some lingering looks and are protective of each other but aren't outright romantic.\n|Language|: A couple of \"damn\"s. A character almost says \"bitch,\" but it comes out with a long \"bbbbb\" sound.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some of the characters wear Converse All-Stars.

After she first makes up \"the perfect man,\" Holly finds she has to continue the lies, to the point that she and her mother exchange emails, with Holly posing as the idealized lover; this makes for some sweet conversations about dreams and goals, but also an awkward situation for adults in the audience, as parent and child are, after all, flirting. This movie includes briefly strained family relationships, as mother and daughter argue, and mother tells the story of the daughter's missing father (though she oddly never discusses the birth circumstances of a second, seven-year-old daughter). This movie also includes repeated references to sexual desire and play, primarily in the form of a gay bartender who makes wisecracks about various men. There are also jokes about breasts and 5th graders losing their virginity.\n|Positive Messages|: Daughter lies to her mother throughout, learns a lesson.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Male bartender flirts with men.

There are some problematic elements, especially with regards to alcohol. Extravagant drinking imagery pervades, especially with Mickey Rooney's grandfatherly character. Other characters are repeatedly shown drinking or talking about drinking. Even Elliott the dragon himself imbibes of a flask. There are some fight scenes, though they are made up more of comical roughhousing than anything scary or violent. However, there are a few songs in which the villains joke about either cutting up Elliott for medicinal ingredients or abusing/killing young Pete, and there is a scene of a teacher hitting a student. Many of the adults, including Pete's abusive adoptive family are portrayed as buffoons, but overall, there are a number of positive takeaways from the story.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Though the heavy drinking does seem to put a weird stagger on the material, most of this is Disney-safe, with the message about holding out hope and maintaining childlike innocence and optimism. Expectedly, most grownups, except the villains, don't believe that Pete actually has a dragon, and adult-authority figures tend to be buffoons.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pete is a nice, honest orphan kid, though kind of one-note in that he\u2019s mostly either being chased or chastising Elliott to behave. Pete never endorses Elliott using his strength or flaming breath against antagonists, and Elliott saves a bunch of townspeople in the end. On the other hand, a schoolteacher is depicted as a particularly nasty and negative character. Pete\u2019s evil-but-dumb adoptive family, the rustic Gogans, are stereotyped hillbillies.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Comical roughhousing, as Elliott (sometimes visible, sometimes not), knocks villains around -- usually into the water -- with his tail, or the bad guys get caught up in their own snares. A few \"comical\" songs in which the villains sing about either cutting up Elliott for medicinal ingredients or abusing/killing young Pete (roasting the boy \"gently\" on a BBQ, for instance).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Extravagant drinking imagery pervades, with Mickey Rooney's character as the town drunk.

It's a throwback to Disney movies of the past: wholesome, sweet, fun, and exciting. That said, the \"exciting\" part includes plenty of peril and danger, as well as some sad moments. Pete is 5 when he's in a terrible car accident that leaves him orphaned and abandoned in the woods, which could definitely upset younger or more sensitive kids. But sweet, furry dragon Elliot takes care of Pete for several years -- until loggers threaten the wilderness and their home. Expect some tense, chases and disturbing scenes when hunters go after Elliot (a gun is pointed at him in one scene) and it appears he's dead. There are also a couple of mildly crude jokes. Mostly, though, this is a sweet film about love, friendship, finding family in unexpected places, appreciating nature, and opening yourself up to believing in magic. It also has clear themes of courage, empathy, and perseverance.\n|Educational Value|: Emphasis on the value of working for the park service and preserving nature.\n|Positive Messages|: Never stop believing in magic. Friendship, loyalty, and honesty are all very important. Trust is earned. The wilderness should be preserved. Family is more important than fame, and family isn't just biological.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mostly very positive: Pete is brave, resourceful, and loyal to Elliot. Elliot cares for Pete and puts himself in danger to rescue him. Grace loves the forest and is determined to protect it. Once she meets Pete, she becomes his advocate. Natalie is Pete's friend from the minute she meets him. She teaches him how the world works and is loyal. Mr. Meacham says that meeting the dragon opened him up to the possibility of magic and how he sees the world. On the downside, Gavin just wants to be successful, no matter what that means for the forest or for Elliot.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril and danger, with some sad moments. Young Pete's parents are killed in a car accident, and he's left alone in the dark woods. He's surrounded by a pack of wolves and is also discovered and chased. He's grabbed and hits his head. Pete flees the hospital, jumps over moving cars, and runs out into the street. Loggers go hunting for Elliot and point a gun at him. Loggers shoot Elliot with a tranquilizer gun and capture him; it appears he's dead. There's a daring chase scene, and Elliot breathes fire at a bridge, causing it to crack. A car goes off the bridge, and it appears that the occupants are dead.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adults hug.\n|Language|: No swearing, but a couple of mildly crude jokes.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie, but tie-in merchandise includes apparel, toys, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d78b9b65a0af8001e39b31e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/peter-pan", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Peter Pan is Disney's classic take on J.M. Barrie's story of the Boy Who Won't Grow Up. It's a tale of courage, magic, and imagination -- and a reminder that growing up means taking responsibility -- but also occasionally a disturbing, violent story of what happens when kids must fend for themselves. There are some very dated racist and sexist stereotypes and themes -- from the \"What Makes the Red Man Red\" song and the depiction of Chief and his tribe to the way all the girls are jealous of each other and Peter's affections. Peter even says \"Girls talk too much,\" and Captain Hook alludes to how \"jealous girls\" are easy to trick. These cultural relics have aged poorly; make sure to talk about why they're problematic with your kids.\n|Educational Value|: Wendy demonstrates the value of having someone who cares about you and looks after you, even if it seems like the Lost Boys have a lot of fun doing whatever they want. Wendy also proves that sometimes you do have to grow up and mature.\n|Positive Messages|: Several obvious themes in the movie, like growing up, maturing, and taking responsibility. The take-away is that imagination is important, and that as long as you have an imagination, you'll always have a magical, child-like quality. That said, there's also cultural insensitivity and racist stereotyping, as well as sexist takes on relationships between female characters.\n|Positive Role Models|: Wendy is a responsible big sister who tries to protect her brothers when they're in Neverland. Despite his motto to never grow up, Peter is brave and ultimately takes responsibility and helps Wendy, John, and Michael return to their parents. Tinker Bell realizes the error of her misguided jealousy and saves Peter's life, though for most of the movie she's incredibly mean to  Wendy. The mermaids are depicted as manipulative. The movie portrays Native Americans in  racist way, with references to \"Red Men,\" \"Injuns,\" and \"savages\" and implied cannibalism.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Captain Hook often points his hook and shoots his gun toward people. A crocodile \"tick tocks\" menacingly in the water. The Lost Boys are ready to attack Wendy and her brothers with slingshots, stones, and other crude weapons. Peter and Hook sword-fight more than once. Tinker Bell is viciously jealous and tries to hurt Wendy. Hook orders the kids to walk the plank, but they survive. Mr. Snee keeps talking about slitting people's throats. The kids are tied up several times -- first by the \"Indians\" and then by Hook's pirates. Hook gives Peter a bomb that explodes but doesn't hurt anyone because Tink sacrifices herself. An all-out brawl develops between the pirates and the Lost Boys. Hook falls into the mouth of the alligator and repeatedly ends up in its jaws.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Tinker Bell is jealous of Wendy, who in turn acts jealously when Peter pays attention to Tiger Lily. The mermaids are also jealous of Wendy and push her into the water. Tiger Lily and Peter rub noses, and then she gives him a kiss on the cheek, which makes him blush red.\n|Language|: Insulting and misogynistic language like \"wench,\" \"stupid,\" \"imbecile,\" \"coward,\" \"cod fish,\" \"bloomin',\" and \"idiot.\" Characters occasionally make sexist remarks like \"Girls talk too much!\" and \"A jealous female can be tricked into anything.\" The \"Indians\" are referred to (and refer to themselves) as the \"Red Man\" and are literally and figuratively drawn from racial stereotypes: Their appearance (feathered headdresses, face paint, etc.) and speech (grunts, stilted English) upholds an exoticized and stereotypical view of Native Americans. A song calls them \"Injuns.\" At one point they tie up the Lost Boys around a big soup pot, as if they were cannibals. Wendy uses the word \"savages\" in reference to both the Lost Boys and the tribe.\n|Products & Purchases|: Part of a Disney franchise; nothing in the movie, but plenty offline.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The Chief passes a peace pipe to the kids, who smoke it and make ugly faces or turn green.

It doesn't have the same mild, pastel-hued feel of the stories, though: There's lots of frenetic action, including perilous chases, attacks with weapons and traps, explosions, and even death. Old Mr. McGregor dies on-screen, and Peter's parents are said to be dead (his father was eaten in a pie). There are also threats, arguments, and temper tantrums, and at one point the animals attack their human enemy with blackberries, knowing he's allergic to them (he has a reaction and must treat himself with an EpiPen). The two main human characters (Rose Byrne and Domhnall Gleeson) fall in love and kiss once. Part of Old Mr. McGregor's buttocks is shown; Peter tries to poke a carrot in the crack. A rooster talks about \"fertilizing all those eggs\" and then tries to be a good father to a gaggle of baby chicks. Language is mild overall but includes insult words like \"stupid,\" \"idiot,\" and \"imbecile.\" A couple of quick scenes include references to drinking and the implication that a character is high (the latter will likely go over kids' heads), and background characters smoke cigarettes. The main characters make lots of iffy decisions, and everyone behaves rather badly until an apology at the end that seems a bit too little, too late. But they do learn a few lessons about listening to others and the fact that there's enough love to go around for everyone.\n|Educational Value|: In the books, Peter learns not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, where he isn't supposed to go. In the movie, Peter essentially gets away with all kinds of mayhem with a simple apology, though he does learn a few things about himself.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters make lots of iffy decisions (including lying and deceiving each other) and treat each other poorly; although there are apologies at the end, it seems a bit too little, too late for what transpired. But Peter and Thomas do find a way to get along in the end and work together for Bea's sake, and characters do talk about the fact that love isn't a finite thing: There's enough to go around for everyone. Peter also learns to listen to others ... sometimes. Jokes about Mr. McGregor dying of \"bad lifestyle choices\" (i.e., drinking and lots of junk food) and a few fat jokes at the expense of Benjamin bunny and a pig character -- but the movie does make eating vegetables look like fun.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter apologizes in the end, but it seems more about saving himself than because he really regrets his reckless behavior. Thomas pretends to be a different kind of person than he really is to appeal to Bea. Bea is gentle and shows kindness toward animals but is sometimes quick to judge other humans. Peter and Thomas are awful to each other but do eventually make peace and work as a team to help Bea. Peter is protective of his sisters and Benjamin, but all the animals do steal from the garden. Some stereotyping (particularly a priggish pig character).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Peter and his sisters have lost both of their parents; their dad for sure was eaten in a pie by Old Mr. McGregor (there's a flashback to the sadness that caused). Old Mr. McGregor dies unexpectedly of a heart attack; Peter pokes his open eye to check. Several perilous situations (rabbits are caught by humans more than once), plus dynamite, explosions, and dangerous pranks; animals attack a human with blackberries after discovering he's allergic to them (he has a reaction and must treat himself with an EpiPen). Humans chase rabbits, threaten them with rakes, etc. One supporting character briefly seems to be dead (she's not). Threats of rabbit-eating. Lots of chasing and falling. Human characters are shocked repeatedly by electricity and snapped in rat traps. Joke about broken ribs. Temper tantrums that include destruction of property.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two human characters fall in love. Dating/flirting scenes, kissing. Nonsexual, but part of Old Mr. McGregor's bottom is shown (Peter tries to insert a carrot into the exposed crack). Joke about how Peter doesn't wear pants. Peter briefly flirts with a \"cute\" girl bunny. A rooster talks about having \"fertilized all those eggs\" and tries to become a responsible father to many baby chicks. Visual joke about Peter's face appearing in the crotch opening of a pair of jeans. Joke about the meaning of the word \"homewrecker.\" A fox goes \"streaking.\" A joke about a jacket includes a reference to nipples. Thomas is shown in his boxers.\n|Language|: Insult/crude words include \"halfwit,\" \"imbecile,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" \"butt,\" \"heck,\" and \"country bumpkin.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Connected to lots of offline Peter Rabbit merchandise. Thomas works at the famous British department store Harrods and drives a Land Rover.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: During the animals' rowdy house party, it's implied that one character is high. In a montage of Old Mr. McGregor's poor lifestyle choices, he's shown drinking. Running joke in which, whenever anyone talks about someone who has died, characters squeeze berries and let the juice run to the ground -- a reference to gang members pouring beer on the ground to memorialize dead friends.

It's loosely based on Beatrix Potter's books and has lots of comic violence. Although Peter (voiced by James Corden) has learned from the mistakes of the first movie -- he now protects Mr. McGregor's (Domhnall Gleeson) tomato garden, stopping others from stealing the produce -- he falls in with a group of criminal animals. This leads to various violent altercations, including punching and kicking people in the face, although there's no sense of any lasting injuries. Animals are seen caged in a pet store; in another scene, humans try to capture and hurt the rabbits. There's an unsettling moment when a pig is hung by the waist with a rope, though it ends up being a prank on Peter. The language is mild, but a character is called a \"sissy.\" Bea (Rose Byrne) almost decides to sell her stories about Peter after she's offered a lot of money -- and even a movie adaptation. But she decides, after much temptation, not to give up her morals for materialistic goods. One of the rabbits is seen eating sweets and subsequently has a drug-like experience (when she goes without, she even suffers withdrawal symptoms). Although many of the characters stray from what's right, they eventually realize the error of their ways.\n|Educational Value|: Although only loosely based on the original Beatrix Potter stories, the movie may inspire kids to seek out the original books.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't allow other people's perceptions of you to form who you are. Characters demonstrate courage. Value of family, teamwork. Characters also steal, use violence, become motivated by money. But they eventually realize the error of their ways.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter has learned from his mistakes in the original movie. He used to steal tomatoes from the garden; now he prevents others from stealing. But when Peter is painted as a villain in the books written about him, he feels he has to become one in real life. He is taken in by a gang of criminal animals who steal and aren't afraid to use violence to get what they want. Peter starts to disregard his family, forgets who is really important to him. But he eventually realizes his mistake and that actually he's a well-meaning rabbit with a good heart. Mr. McGregor has a stormy relationship with Peter but admits that he actually sees the rabbit like a son. Peter in turn sees Mr. McGregor as a father figure.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick violence throughout; some scenes are quite aggressive. Peter punches and kicks Mr. McGregor repeatedly in the face. A group of animals trip up a number of farmers, knocking them over and hitting them pretty hard. The animals also attack someone in their own home; homeowner hits their head on a doorframe while running away. While in a boxing ring, a character hits someone hard in the face. In one unsettling sequence, a pig is hung by a rope; it's revealed to be just a prank. Animals are caged by humans in a pet store, sold against their will. Humans try to hit and capture rabbits. A hedgehog bites a wire, briefly getting electrocuted.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couple discuss having a child. Character develops romantic feelings for their colleague. A hedgehog jokes about having sex appeal.\n|Language|: Characters insult each other, but without using strong language. A character refers to another as a \"sissy.\" Some crude humor in the form of burping.\n|Products & Purchases|: Movie promotes notion of buying fresh produce, with various characters spending time at a farmer's market. Part of the story involves idea of someone selling their stories about Peter Rabbit. Initially reluctant to sell, the author is persuaded by the prospect of becoming rich, wanting a fancy sports car, their story being turned into a movie. But they eventually have a change of heart.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: During a break-in, some animals take a bottle of champagne from the fridge and spray it all over someone. After a rabbit eats sweets, it is implied that they are high and hallucinating, mimicking experience of drug use. The rabbit even suffers withdrawal symptoms when going without.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683d961905001eb959eb": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/picture-this", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Picture This! is a 2008 movie in which an unpopular teen must outwit her overly-protective father in order to make it to a party thrown by a popular boy who is starting to like her. The teens are inseparable from their video phones and sometimes border on voyeurism with their exploitation of peers' embarrassing moments. In one scene, for instance, a girl snaps a photo of her classmate's partially-exposed thong underwear and emails it to the entire student body to humiliate her. There's frequent bullying, often with the help of relatively-new-at-the time cell phone technology; the main bully gets her comeuppance, but not in a way that punishes bullying, but instead via \"a taste of her own medicine.\" Reckless driving -- lead character drives through traffic covering her eyes while lying to her dad about not driving. Teen drinking at a party. Cursing includes \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"boobsicles.\" Some brands mentioned. While there's nothing beyond a kiss and slow dances to see, teens use terms like \"do her and dump her\" and \"hump and dump\" to refer to potential casual sex. The main character's rebellious teen behavior (sneaking out to attend a party, lying to parents, etc.) is cast in a humorous light, but she does learn valuable lessons about listening to her conscience.\n|Positive Messages|: While the movie is centered on the theme of growing up, of \"taking the training wheels off\" and taking chances in life, this theme is counterbalanced by some iffy messages. Dating the teen boy believed to be the cutest and most popular takes precedence over everything else for the lead character, her friends, and their rivals. Bullying with the relatively-new cell phone technology is frequent, and the main bully gets her comeuppance not by being made accountable for her actions, but by \"getting a taste of her own medicine.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Nearly every teen uses a video phone to communicate with friends and to email embarrassing photos of classmates to their friends. A teen girl deceives her father, sneaking out of the house to go to a party that he's banned her from. Some girls play mean-spirited pranks on their peers to humiliate them. On the positive side, a teen finds the inner strength to make a difficult decision and to appreciate her father's love for her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Reckless driving -- a teen girl covers her eyes and drives her car in neutral in traffic while lying to her father about not driving. Frequent bullying.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teens talk about sex in casual terms like \"do her and dump her\" and \"hump and dump,\" but physical contact is limited to slow dances and one kiss. The main character swoons over the school's most popular boy, describing him as a \"hottie\" and vowing to do anything to get him to notice her. A young boy finds a Girls Gone Wild-type DVD and watches it.\n|Language|: Infrequent profanity: \"Crap,\" \"damn,\" \"ass.\" Some references to sex. Breasts called \"boobsicles.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Reference to one of the characters looking like he \"walked out of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog.\" Apple laptops.

The film has some brief sad moments which are quickly resolved, and some mild cartoon peril (stumbles, tumbles, a raging waterfall, angry bees) after which everything turns out well. The most sensitive younger children might momentarily believe that characters have been hurt or lost.\n|Educational Value|: Brings to the screen three original A.A. Milne stories for the first time. It also introduces a scrapbook as a way of holding on to memories that are important.\n|Positive Messages|: Piglet's Big Movie stresses the value of being useful, helpful, and then appreciated for your efforts.

Piglet encounters the most danger: bumps and falls, hanging from a tree limb, getting stuck in a boot. Everyone is chased by angry bees, gets in trouble in a river, and experiences tumbles and falls throughout.

One of the lead characters is a pot dealer, and the other smokes it habitually; pot is also sold to schoolchildren. There's also lots more violence than in most comedies from producer Judd Apatow, as well as constant strong language (including \"f--k,\" and \"s--t\").

This film pushes the limits of PG. It includes several sexual situations and allusions, including a reference to Viagra. There's some crude language and potty humor. The movie features frequent slapstick violence: various objects (balls, lamps, a badge, cars) slam into torsos, crotches, and faces, causing bruises (at least); a couple of explosions and two murders occur (one a needle to the neck, another by gunfire, off-screen); a secret agent spoof involves the violent defeat of several black-masked figures in a casino, etc. Clouseau mispronounces English words (\"bowls\" become \"balls\").

Some scenes and themes may be intense for younger or sensitive viewers, such as when Pinocchio is kidnapped and caged, threatened with destruction, can't find his father, and nearly drowns. Pinocchio's friend Lampwick introduces him to cigar smoking but is punished for it. Kids may be disturbed by Pleasure Island, where \"bad boys\" are turned into donkeys and sent to work in salt mines. But overall this morality tale is a good reminder of the importance of listening to your conscience.\n|Positive Messages|: Pinocchio learns in the roughest of circumstances what happens to little boys who aren't brave, truthful, and unselfish. He's tricked, cheated, lied to, and kidnapped, sometimes with his own consent, as he ignores his conscience (as embodied by Jiminy Cricket). Ultimately he learns what it means to be a good, \"real\" boy. Humility, compassion, and integrity are additional themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pinocchio learns the importance of listening to his conscience and always trying to do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket tries his best to teach Pinocchio right from wrong and to keep his charge out of harm's way. Geppetto is a kind and selfless man, rewarded for making so many people happy by being given a real son in the form of Pinocchio. Bad guys are manipulative and creepy, but they're clearly evil.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character shoots a gun when he thinks an intruder is in his house. Young boys are shown fighting each other and destroying a mansion. Cartoonish violence throughout: Characters fall, run into each other, hit each other in the face. Some scenes and themes may be intense for younger or sensitive viewers, such as when Pinocchio is kidnapped and caged, threatened with destruction, can't find his father, and nearly drowns.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Jiminy Cricket places his hand on the rear end of a female statue, realizes what he's doing, and says, \"Pardon me....\"\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Decades after the film was released, \"Pleasure Island\" became an adult-themed part of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.

The movie focuses on what happens when one of the beloved fairies \"goes rogue\" and joins forces with pirates from Skull Rock to become the titular Pirate Fairy. There is a bit more violence in this installment than in others, because the pirates brandish swords and want to get rid of the fairies -- but no one is seriously injured (although James is bitten by a baby crocodile). This installment, like all of the Tinker Bell movies, focuses on the importance of teamwork and friendship.\n|Educational Value|: It's not educational per se, but kids will learn lessons about second chances and unconditional friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: This installment in the Tinker Bell franchise once again promotes friendship, teamwork, and using your talents. The fairies work together to help Zarina and recapture the powerful blue pixie dust. Zarina's story line encourages viewers to think about redemption and forgiveness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Zarina is a curious and intelligent fairy, even though she breaks the rules. She ultimately seeks forgiveness for putting Pixie Hollow in jeopardy.

It's packed with more death, action, and violence than most superhero flicks -- from the grim opening sequence in which Caribbean civilians (including a young boy) are led to the gallows to the climactic swashbuckling showdown. Since it's nearly three hours long, younger kids (or those with short attention spans) may not go the distance. And with so many double crosses and betrayals, the plot may even be confusing for adults. That said, thanks to Disney's ubiquitous merchandising and advertising campaigns, even 5-year-olds know who Captain Jack Sparrow is, so chances are your youngest kids will want to see it. But if they do, be prepared for them to wake up with nightmares.\n|Positive Messages|: Elizabeth and Tia Dalma are strong, fearless female characters, and the cast of this movie is much more diverse than the previous two. Despite several betrayals, Jack and Will sacrifice what they want most and act selflessly for the greater good. Jack often acts as though he has no morals or ethics, but he's true to a strange code of his own.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters are hanged -- including a young boy -- and their dead bodies are shown in a pile. Lots of pirates, British soldiers, and unlucky seamen are stabbed and blown up -- especially in the final hour. Younger children may be disturbed by the opening gallows sequence and by seeing major characters die.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Elizabeth and Will kiss passionately. Several scantily dressed pirates' mistresses; a couple is discreetly shown dressing after marital sex, but there's no nudity.

In one disturbing scene, Will is tied to a mast and flogged by Bootstrap Bill. Also, the grotesque pirates and CGI sea creatures are menacing and downright scary. And there's lots and lots of rum. Profanity includes \"damn,\" \"ass,\" and \"bloody.\" Innuendoes and double meanings are rampant, notably involving a compass, swords, and fighting.\n|Positive Messages|: Fight for what you believe in. Save your friends in situations of danger. Every man has a price. Eternal damnation is something to be avoided. Even the most amoral among us may someday reveal a scrap of decency underneath.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jack Sparrow appears to be a deceitful, selfish coward without a conscience, but in the darkest, most perilous moments he shows honor and selflessness. William is noble, honorable, and brave. Elizabeth displays uncommon courage and adventurousness. Beckett is callous. William's father abandoned his child to run off to sea, but he still cares deeply enough for his son to sacrifice himself.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters are chased, stabbed, flogged, shot at, trampled, roasted, and rolled down hills. A sea monster uses its giant tentacles to pluck screaming sailors off ships and swallow up the vessels whole. Davy Jones is an evil, devilish character whose head is a noseless mass of Medusa-like squirming serpents and whose hands are lobster claws. He steals souls of sailors and condemns them to decades of hard labor. Sword fights, shootings, stabbings, and deaths-by-tentacle are rife. Jack wears a necklace of human fingers and toes. Cannibals tie Jack to a stake and suspend him over a fire, but he escapes. Men are caged and hung over an abyss. A severed beating heart is shown in a box. Men are put in cages so their eyes can be plucked out by birds. Elizabeth and William are threatened with hanging. It's implied that cannibals might eat a dog.

It focuses on a mission Sparrow shares with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) -- the only son of earlier franchise stars William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), neither of whom appears much in the film. This time around, an older, drunker (he downs a lot of rum) Sparrow faces yet another great enemy: the ghost of a pirate-killing Spanish captain, Salazar (Javier Bardem). As usual for this series, expect lots of action violence and a high body count, with lots of close-range sword-fighting and killings (Salazar only ever leaves one man alive aboard a ship). People die in gun battles, from drowning, via burning, and from having their throats slit. The romance is light and limited to Sparrow's innuendos, some double-meaning jokes, and a couple of kisses. Language is mild, mostly limited to \"damn\" and \"hell.\" Despite the popularity of this franchise -- and the fact that it offers messages about unconditional family love, women's intelligence/worth, and teamwork -- it's still too scary for young kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite the fact that pirates are, by definition, thieves, the movie offers positive messages about the unconditional love between parents and children -- as well as how women are worthy of respect and consideration for their intelligence and expertise. Themes include teamwork and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Carina is an intelligent, logical, curious young woman who's willing to risk her safety to find the answers she's looking for. Henry is also smart and courageous and selflessly wants to break his father's curse. Pirates in general are iffy role models, but Jack Sparrow remains a character apart.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action violence, with a high body count. People die on burning boats, from hand-to-hand combat, sword fighting, shoot-outs, etc. Lots of fighting sequences. Drownings. Salazar slits pirates' throats and has entire ships killed except for one to live to tell the tale. Creepy supernatural villains.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kisses. Captain Jack makes countless innuendos and jokes with double meanings. Carina undresses down to her long underwear to jump in the water, and Henry marvels that he saw her ankles. There's a back-and-forth when Carina says she's a \"horologist,\" which the pirates believe has something to do with \"whore.\"\n|Language|: \"Witch,\" \"wench,\" \"horologist\" (said as if it were \"whore\"), \"damn,\" \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie itself, but there's a lot of Pirates-themed merchandise, video games, apparel.

But rum and wine do still flow in a couple of scenes, and there are loads of innuendo-laden comments (most thanks to Johnny Depp's iconic Captain Jack Sparrow) -- as well as all of the swordfighting, explosions, and felled pirates and soldiers that audiences are used to in this franchise. Though there are some deaths, none are bloody/graphic. And although this movie isn't an age-appropriate pick for young kids who might be frightened by some of the pirates and fighting, this shorter-and-simpler edition is fine for older tweens and up.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite the fact that pirates are, by definition, thieves, the movie offers several positive messages about how parents should sacrifice for their children and how every being is worthy of being treated with kindness and respect.\n|Positive Role Models|: Philip the missionary is very moral and helps keep Blackbeard from being sadistic whenever possible. He protects Syrena the mermaid and sacrifices his own safety for her. Angelica is a strong and fierce female character who can hold her own against male pirates. Jack and Barbossa, despite their past rivalries, are able to work together against Blackbeard.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of sword fighting, some of which ends up in death but some of which stops just short of a kill. Also gun use and a brief explosion, and a pirate is punished by being sent on a longboat and then burned. A mermaid is captured and threatened with death; someone is poisoned, a man's throat is slit, and there are other scenes of swashbuckling and violence. But actual blood is minimal, and the body count isn't as high as in the other movies.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Captain Jack makes countless innuendos and jokes with double meanings. (A typical exchange: \"What were you doing in a Spanish convent?\"/\"I thought it was a brothel -- honest mistake.\") He whispers something presumably naughty to a woman who begins to swoon. Jack and Angelica dance and roll around on the floor, fighting and flirting. Random, rowdy pub patrons are briefly shown kissing (with one woman leading a man up the stairs), and two other couples kiss in more passionate exchanges\n|Language|: A couple of uses of \"damn\" and \"my God,\" plus some pirate insults -- usually directed at Jack.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie itself, but the Pirates franchise has loads of merchandising and toy deals, including LEGO sets, video and board games, costumes, and collectible figures.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Fewer drunk-pirate scenes than in the previous movies, but there's still a good bit of drinking (rum, wine) and alcohol-related humor.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776824999c64001ec2beb6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a swashbuckling pirate adventure based on the famous Disney ride that stars Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, and Orlando Bloom. The movie is not especially graphic but does feature things like an undead pirate crew that may be disturbing to some kids. There are revealing bodices and mild sexual references (not explicit and showing no nudity or sexual situations). Swearing includes \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell,\" plus colorful pirate language. Characters drink rum and get tipsy.\n|Positive Messages|: Main characters eventually work together to defeat an evil band of undead pirates. But they also constantly double- and triple-cross each other.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main character is a scoundrel, albeit a charming one, and authority figures are portrayed negatively. But other characters, including the two main women, are shown as strong and independent, each in their own way.\n|Diverse Representations|: Strong female lead avoids being a damsel in distress. An Afro-Latina woman (Zoe Saldana) in a supporting role captains her own ship. But for a film set in Jamaica, it seems odd that the scenes in town feature nearly no people of color.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A lot of action violence, characters killed.

Band of Misfits isn't your typical pirate adventure, but there's still action, mild high-seas peril, a little bit of colorful language (\"hell,\" etc.), and some parent-targeted jokes about the two historical characters depicted in the movie: Queen Victoria and Charles Darwin. Although the pirates use guns and swords and have hand-to-hand fights, they don't face any real danger until the climactic battle with the queen; before that, their enemies are schoolchildren, lepers, and ghosts. That said, the queen is quite menacing, and Darwin is greedy in his attempts to steal from the pirates. But the pirates themselves, rather than being bloodthirsty and selfish, are more like a family that sticks together, loot or no loot.\n|Educational Value|: If they're paying attention, kids will learn some historical facts -- like that in 1837, Queen Victoria ascended the throne, or that that's when a young Charles Darwin was keeping his early notebooks about the environment. Obviously, there are some exaggerations and liberties taken with the truth, but the portrayals of the queen and Darwin are so amusing that kids are bound to want to learn more about whether they're real and what their place in history is.\n|Positive Messages|: Subtle messages about unconditional friendship, loyalty, tolerance, and what constitutes a family. The Pirate Captain's crew is indeed a bunch of misfits (an albino, a woman pretending to be a man, a peg-legged pirate, and a captain who can't seem to find any booty), but they stand by one another, even when times are dire.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pirates aren't exactly positive role models, but a couple of them act honorably. The Pirate Captain rescues his pet from the clutches of the movie's villain, even though he could have ended up in prison or dead. And pirate Number Two and the rest of the crew save the day, even though the Pirate Captain had betrayed them. On the flip side, Darwin is depicted as weaselly and selfish, and young Queen Victoria is homicidal and bloodthirsty when it comes to endangered animals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some gun, sword, and hand-to-hand violence. There are explosions and close calls, but no one is killed or permanently injured, although the queen must be subdued in order to save the Dodo bird that was going to be slaughtered and eaten. The pirates face off against ghosts.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Female pirate Cutlass Liz has noticeable cleavage, and the male pirates stare at her curves in one saloon scene. Darwin has an overwhelming crush on the queen and says her severe bun \"does it for him.\" The Pirate Captain flirts with one of Darwin's female friends during a night at the pub.

There's also some kissing and lots of sexual innuendo and some sexual discussion, plus several jokes about a lesbian character's attraction to other women in the group. Although the young women portrayed here are, for the most part, strong and confident, sometimes a shaming word, \"slut,\" is used to refer to them.\n|Positive Messages|: Find your passion, and don't be afraid to take risks. Also: Open your heart to love, and it might find you. Joining groups may require you to overcome your skepticism and fears, but it may also lead you to even greater happiness. Teamwork is important.\n|Positive Role Models|: Beca's individualistic streak extends to the rest of the Bellas in a positive way, though it does take them a while to learn how to be supportive of one another.

The women, particularly Amy, make some crass comments and jokes, but they're ultimately good-natured. The ensemble is diverse, with multiple ethnicities and one LGBTQ member. The commentators make sexist jokes (all intended to be over the top/played for laughs), but there are fewer fat jokes in this installment.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Bellas accidentally cause a fire and general mayhem in a hotel suite (lots of people fall over, shatter windows, etc.). The Bellas are taken hostage and held by armed henchmen. A big martial arts-style fight involves a couple of weapons but mostly just arms and legs. A character causes an explosion on a boat.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kissing, references to vaginas (whether they're tight, how they need to breathe, an ongoing joke about the name of a band -- \"Ever Moist\"), and lots of innuendo.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"bitches,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"t-ts,\" \"slutty,\" \"tart,\" and a middle finger gesture. A boat is named \"Fat Dingo Bitch.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Apple, Beats headphones.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink at bars and parties.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769c3fb0d55001f52f424": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/planes", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Disney's Planes is an adventure that, like Cars, takes place in a world populated by vehicles. A few scenes of peril that place main characters in danger (a terrible storm, a squadron of fighter planes crashing, etc.) may upset younger/more sensitive kids, as may the tension of the big race itself. Because the story is about a crop duster who dares to compete against racing planes, many insults are hurled his way -- like \"farm boy,\" \"loser,\" and \"bum,\" as well as \"idiot\" and \"moron.\" There's an overt romantic subplot between two secondary characters, including a moonlight serenade and the appearance of lots of kiss marks on the male plane's body. Parents are likely to notice a quick derogatory reference to male planes as \"ladies\" and a lot of cultural stereotypes in the movie (which warrant a post-viewing check-in with kids). But ultimately the message encourages kids to overcome their limitations.\n|Educational Value|: Although its aim is to entertain rather than educate, Planes will teach kids a bit about the physics of aeronautics and flight, as well as information (some of it stereotypical in a way that's intended to be funny) about other cultures -- like the fact that cows are considered sacred in India, as well as customary dress and/or landmarks.\n|Positive Messages|: Dusty's journey encourages viewers to not feel limited by their exteriors. Even though he's repeatedly told that he's not up to the task, Dusty works hard to overcome his fears and flaws and compete with the more experienced racing planes. Dusty dreams of doing more than he was built for, and he asks his fans to do the same. Friends are loyal and supportive of each other.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dusty is disciplined in his practices to fly higher and faster. He overcomes all the odds and proves his naysayers wrong through his commitment and hard work. Skipper comes out of his self-imposed exile to teach Dusty all he knows about flying fast and with precision. Dusty's friends Chug and Dottie are extremely supportive and cheer him on as he tries to do the impossible. On the downside, there are many cultural stereotypes in the movie -- particularly about Mexican, Indian, British, and Southern people/cultures -- and, in a joke early in the movie, one male plane refers to other male planes as \"ladies,\" implying that they're inferior.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few scenes of peril when it seems like Dusty might crash or die, like when he's caught in a terrible storm and goes underwater, when he flies through a tunnel that a train is approaching head on, or when Ripslinger and his crew injure him. A flashback shows an entire squadron of fighter planes being downed (being shot at, crashing into flames, plunging into the sea).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Chupacabra pursues Rochelle, with whom he's fallen in love; after a dramatic serenade, she falls for him, too, and he shows up the next day covered in pink kiss marks. They touch noses and call each other nicknames. Dusty and Ishani are flirtatiously sweet to each other. A male plane says \"look at that propeller\" while looking at a female plane's backside.\n|Language|: Insults like \"idiot,\" \"moron,\" \"knucklehead,\" \"loser,\" \"punks,\" \"farm boy,\" \"bum,\" and \"go plow yourself.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The only brand referred to in the movie itself is Apple; a plane is looking at what is obviously a tablet computer, and he calls it a \"SkyPad.\" But there are lots of off-screen licensing/merchandise tie-ins: clothes, games, apps, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Reference to a fuel enhancer that disqualifies one of the participating planes.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a5147dd6e001f6d146e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/planes-fire-rescue", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Planes: Fire and Rescue is the superior 3D sequel to Planes. There are several perilous firefighting/rescue scenes (including one in which the heroes are boxed in by a fire and fear they might suffocate) that could upset younger children, especially when viewed in 3D. The firefighters routinely put their lives at risk as they swoop into the raging wildfires, and there's mention that some don't make it back (late in the movie, one specific sad death is referred to). There are a few stereotypes, including a boy-crazy female firefighter plane who borders on stalking Dusty (and makes some mildly suggestive comments -- i.e. \"they're real\" in reference to some of her parts) and a wise, strong Native American helicopter, but cultural stereotypes aren't as prevalent as they were in the original Planes. Essentially, the movie is a beautifully animated tribute to the men and women who put their lives at risk to keep the national parks safe.\n|Educational Value|: Planes: Fire and Rescue gives kids a glimpse of what it\u2019s like to be a firefighter or smokejumper. They also learn a bit about fire safety and what it means to dedicate your life to other people.\n|Positive Messages|: Planes: Fire and Rescue is about the sacrifice that firefighters make every day. They put their lives at risk so others can be safe and are heroes not because they have special powers but because they do their jobs and cooperate with the team. There's also a strong emphasis on community and working together, as well as accepting the consequences of your mistakes and learning from them.\n|Positive Role Models|: The firefighting planes put their lives at risk to keep people safe and protect the national park. Dusty realizes that sometimes life doesn\u2019t work out as planned, and he has to think of others over himself. The firefighters are determined to fight fires and save those in danger, no matter what the personal cost. Blade Ranger, who leads the firefighting team, teaches Dusty the value of being prepared, safe, and aware of others. Dusty's friends at home are as supportive of him as ever. On the other hand, while there aren\u2019t as many stereotypes as there were in Planes, there are a few. Windlifter is a wise, strong, unflappable Native American helicopter, and hauler plane Lil' Dipper -- the sole major female character in the sequel -- instantly becomes obsessed with Dusty (making a few inappropriate comments that will likely go over younger kids\u2019 head). A shiny SUV that runs the new lodge is focused on status and attention. He puts his everyone's lives in danger in order to save the lodge building -- but his actions are clearly presented as selfish and wrong, and he suffers the consequences.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent scenes of peril, mostly due to scary wildfires. (Possible spoiler alerts ahead!) Many different vehicle characters are in peril at different times; two are in particular danger when they're trapped on a bridge and surrounded by fire (they make a harrowing escape in the nick of time). The firefighter planes repeatedly fly into smoke and burning embers; the smokejumper vehicles are temporarily trapped in one instance. Dusty crashes into the river (and is caught up in the rapids approaching a waterfall) and a lake, getting extremely banged up in the process. Dusty and Blade become trapped in an old mine while the fire rages around them, and they fear they might suffocate; Blade sustains serious damage from heat and debris. There's a wall with pictures of planes that have crashed; viewers find out that includes a friend of Blade\u2019s that died years earlier. Early in the movie, Dusty flies off angrily and has a rough, near-crash landing that ends up causing a fire in Propwash Junction; some moments of tension as he and his friends work on putting it out.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lil' Dipper forms an aggressive crush on Dusty and often talks about going on dates with him. She makes a few other mildly suggestive comments (\"they're real\" in reference to a couple of her parts, etc.), and when they go to a party at the park's lodge, she talks about sharing a room with Dusty and the children they'd have together. During a flashback scene, Blade Ranger is seen in a TV show called CHoPs where he and his partner helicopter pick up two \"twin\" cars. A \"pickup truck\" tries to hit on another car in a bar. An older motor home couple discusses their romance and engagement.\n|Language|: A few phrases meant to suggest swearing -- like \"oh, Chevy\" and \"I kicked Aston-Martin.\" Also \"shut the hangar door\" and a couple of insults, including \"dumb\" and \"bumper kisser.\" Also a little crude, gas-related humor.\n|Products & Purchases|: While there are no actual brands in the movie, there are many off screen tie-ins, from toys to clothes to games to food. Some of the movie's brands are meant to suggest real-life equivalents -- like \"Honkers\" bar, the TV show CHoPS, the movie Howard the Truck, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The planes socialize in a bar-like hanger and at a swanky lodge, drinking from from cans of motor oil, which they sometimes buy for each other like drinks. Reference to a \"motor-jito.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683f2ec6b5001f6bd997": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/planet-51", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this animated alien comedy earns its PG rating with a fair bit of sexualized humor -- including jokes about anal probing and penises which may go over younger kids' head (though middle schoolers won't be duped -- in fact, they'll probably find it hilarious). There's also some mostly mild violence -- though weapons are involved -- as the alien army attempts to capture and subdue a human astronaut (voiced by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson), as well as references to a maniacal doctor's desire to suck out Chuck's brain for scientific reasons. The language is mostly tame (\"moron\" and \"stupid\"), if disrespectful; beyond the sometimes-crude jokes, the sexuality revolves around one character's infatuation with another, which culminates in a kiss. Despite taking place on another planet, there are a few brands featured in the movie, including Volkswagen, Twix, and iPods.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: Much of the positive stuff is secondary to the suggestive humor, but Lem and his friends do work together to help Chuck, and Chuck learns to trust the aliens, despite his initial hesitation.\n|Positive Role Models|: Some characters are less than admirable, but Lem and Neera are positive role models: Lem takes a risk to trust Chuck, and Neera believes in peaceful protest to enact change.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An alien general and soldiers try to take down the American astronaut with military weapons and guns. An alien doctor is after Chuck's brain -- for scientific reasons, of course...\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \"Parking\" aliens talk about how it's their first time \"parking\" (i.e. kissing in car). Two alien adolescents flirt with each other and eventually kiss. A female alien with robust cleavage gets angry at a male alien who's staring at her. A character makes repeated references to alien \"probes\" and how to discourage them. The astronaut tries to teach an alien how to romance \"chicks.\" After seeing the astronaut naked (he drops his towel for a second, but the audience doesn't see anything), an alien jokes \"that's a funny place for an antenna.\"\n|Language|: Mild language includes \"what the...,\" \"moron,\" and \"stupid.\" There's also crass humor that includes commentary about  \"chicks,\" \"alien probes,\" and a  penis joke (the alien thinks it's an \"antenna\").\n|Products & Purchases|: Twix candy bars, Sea Monkeys, and Volkswagen are recognizable/discussed brands.

The kids wreak havoc at the firehouse, playing with equipment and testing the patience of by-the-book Supe and his loyal crew (John Leguizamo, Keegan-Michael Key, and Tyler Mane). There's not much iffy material, but you can expect a few moments of peril (fires, crashes, a near fall off a cliff), some bathroom humor (the littlest sibling's poop gets all over), and mild teasing between the kids and the adults. A couple flirts, embraces, and kisses; a teen tries to give a man text-flirting advice; and there's a quick image of a poster of a scantily clad woman's behind. The movie pays tribute to the courage of emergency responders and to the impact of intergenerational friendship and foster and adoptive parenting. The story encourages adults to prioritize family and friends over professional ambition and has themes of empathy and teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive representation of importance of community helpers and emergency responders like smoke jumpers. Promotes keeping orphaned siblings together and impact of foster and adoptive parenting. Salutes intergenerational friendship and mentorship. Themes include courage, empathy, teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jake and squad of smoke jumpers are brave, brotherly, kind. Several have playful sides that allow them to connect to, form bonds with the siblings. Jake is a man of order and organization; he's driven, disciplined, loyal. Dr. Amy Hicks is intelligent, environmentally aware, and kind (if not exactly a huge part of the film). The kids want to be together, to be safe, to be loved.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Physical comedy and slapstick as kids wreak havoc at firehouse. Fire scene in which kids are saved is momentarily frightening, as are two scenes in which the kids are in danger of crashing or even falling off a cliff.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting and eventual embracing/kissing between a couple. A teen tries to give a man advice on how to text-flirt with a woman he's interested in. One quick image of a smoke jumper's poster of a scantily clad woman's behind.\n|Language|: Bathroom humor includes a joke about a preschooler pooping in her disposable training pants -- and the poop getting everywhere during a disastrous diaper change.\n|Products & Purchases|: My Little Pony (animated show, as well as merchandise -- toys and party supplies) is prominently featured.

Much of the plot revolves around two warring factions, so expect to see sharpening and brandishing weapons, fighting, and shoot-outs as well as frequent anti-Native terminology like \"dirty savages\" and \"filthy heathens.\" This film is a love story, so main characters share kisses and close body language. This historical inaccuracy might leave viewers believing that the historical figure Pocahontas fell in love with John Smith in real life. She did not: She was an 11- or 12-year-old child named Matoaka when John Smith's ship landed.\n|Educational Value|: The story is historically inaccurate, so many of the \"facts\" gleaned here will be incorrect, such as Pocahontas' age and name and John Smith's sympathy for Indigenous people. Moreover, the fact that the characters' language barrier is a flimsy, quickly forgotten non-issue is unrealistic and reinforces the \"magical Native\" stereotype.\n|Positive Messages|: Pocahontas makes a point to educate John Smith about his prejudiced ideas about Native people and the benefits of colonization. He assumes that because her people live differently that they aren't sophisticated, when, in fact, her people use their communication skills in a far more advanced way than Smith's colleagues do. Some messages might confuse young viewers, such as Governor Ratcliff's assertion that \"a man is not a man unless he knows how to shoot\" and songs about how Indigenous people are \"savages\" who should be killed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pocahontas is a brave woman with a strong moral code who fights for peace. Pocahontas' father, Chief Powhatan, is a caring father: Although he ignores her opinions at first, he takes her words very seriously when making an important decision. The leadership shown in the British camp isn't as thoughtful or kind, and John Smith is initially focused on \"claiming\" the \"wild\" land and \"civilizing\" Indigenous people.\n|Diverse Representations|: Shows the harm that colonization has on Indigenous people and land but treats it as fixable through communication. Several important elders and women characters, such as Grandmother Willow. But Governor Ratcliff and Wiggins are jokes because they aren't ruggedly masculine (hair bows, gardening). Main character Pocahontas is a brave woman with a strong moral compass. She's portrayed as an adult whose love for John Smith leads to peace; in reality, she was an 11- or 12-year-old child. Many main and background characters are Indigenous people, and they are voiced by Indigenous actors. Shows important parts of Powhatan culture, such as the Algonquian language, but also significant inaccuracies, such as lighter skin tones and \"sexy\" clothing fits. The movie can also be seen as reinforcing harmful cinematic clich\u00e9s such as the \"magical Native\" and \"Indian giver\" tropes. Anti-Native terminology -- \"savages,\" \"filthy heathens\" -- and comments about killing Indigenous people are supposed to reflect prejudices or lack of knowledge, but they occur so frequently (especially in the song \"Savages\") that it may upset watchers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Three people are shot, one fatally, although no blood or wounds are shown. John Smith is imprisoned and nearly executed during a climactic scene. Much of the plot revolves around two warring factions: the British colonizers and the Powhatan people. Expect to see casual talk of violence, knives being sharpened and brandished, swords, muskets, and shoot-outs where men die from bullet wounds. A perilous scene on a ship in the ocean where a man nearly drowns.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Pocahontas and John Smith share two kisses and have close body language (holding hands, hugging). Although Pocahontas was historically an 11- or 12-year-old child, she is portrayed in the film as an adult woman in \"sexy\" fitting clothing.\n|Language|: One use of \"crazy.\" Indigenous people are referred to as uncivilized and vermin, and called \"injun,\" \"dirty savages,\" and \"filthy heathens.\" The frequent use of these terms (including in songs) may upset watchers.\n|Products & Purchases|: Pocahontas has become a popular Disney \"princess\" whose branding reaches far and wide on consumer merchandise, food products, etc. as well as in books, websites, and other media.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In a scene onboard the ship, a keg of wine is uncorked, and men fill their mugs.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683aeb5d26001f1e1e0a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/pocahontas-ii-journey-to-a-new-world", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents nedd to know that this movie, while inoffensive, is highly inaccurate historically.

There's definitely some violence: Pok\u00e9mon battle both each other and humans, and there's destruction (including a fatal car crash) and injuries, but nothing gets bloody or graphic. Main characters are frequently in peril, but -- despite some close calls -- no one dies. Language is limited to \"hell,\" \"stupid,\" and \"good God,\" and there's nothing more risque than flirting and a couple of double-meaning jokes (when Pikachu sees a shirtless man, he quips that all he can see is \"tattoos and nipples\"). The story promotes teamwork, courage, and friendship and shows how even the seemingly inexperienced can make a difference.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes teamwork, courage, friendship.

But it's also an adventure, with lots of roller-coaster thrills and some scary characters that might be too intense and frightening for the youngest kids. The Express roars, speeds, and skids on its perilous journey to the North Pole. Sometimes out of control, sometimes racing against dangers and obstacles in its path, it's the center of a tale that's suspenseful throughout. The child heroes are frequently in danger -- from falls, getting lost, being left alone on a careening train, and navigating dark, shadowy places facing characters who may wish them harm. Also worth noting: The story focuses on a boy who doubts whether or not there is a Santa.

The humor is sharp and female focused; it often revolves around one character's matter-of-fact sexual assertiveness and the Bring It On-style rivalry between groups of older and younger cheerleaders. Expect to hear quite a bit of language, both swearing (\"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"s--t\") and sexual innuendo (\"erection,\" \"prophylactic\"). Characters also drink and talk about \"reefer,\" and there are exchanges that include sexual putdowns (\"slut\"). The cancer story isn't handled heavily, but Keaton's character is shown vomiting frequently to remind viewers that the disease is taking its toll. It's worth noting that these women aren't presented through a Hollywood lens: Everyone looks authentic, with a diverse cast and various realistic body types. Other messages include the idea that you're never too old to pursue your dreams and that it's important to have the courage of your convictions; themes also touch on teamwork, courage, and perseverance. With its strong girl power vibe, it's a film about being old that's also likely to entertain those who are young, thanks to the teen characters (Alisha Boe, Charlie Tahan) who get pulled into helping train the older women.\n|Positive Messages|: Strongest messages: You're never too old to pursue your dreams, and it's important to have the courage of your convictions -- trusting your own judgment and trusting others to support you. Celebrates value of female friendship and demonstrates how good friends support each other. Promotes courage, perseverance, teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Martha plans to live out the rest of her life in private after cancer diagnosis, but Sheryl encourages her to fulfill a lifelong dream while having fun. They form a racially diverse cheerleading squad of senior citizens who support each other. Rival high school cheering team is also diverse, and the teen girls have realistically fit bodies rather than unrealistic \"Hollywood\"-type figures. A teen character defies ageist attitudes. Another is remorseful for her mean girl behavior, takes steps to rectify it.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A rock is thrown on the car of a negative character. A main character receives a serious health diagnosis (cancer) and suffers physically (vomiting, etc.). Rival groups demonstrate competitive attitudes with some sexual putdowns -- e.g., \"Shouldn't you be giving some football player a hand job?\" A man calls a teen girl a \"slut,\" and the older women rally around her; the man apologizes and backs down.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Quite a bit of innuendo, but not in sense of sexual enticement; most (though not all) is subtle. A teacher introduces a sex-ed video about STDs. Punchlines include words \"erection,\" \"prophylactic,\" \"rape\" (used as a misunderstood word), and sleeping with a person of power to win something. One older woman is particularly interested in finding sexual partners, but nothing sexual actually occurs.

It also involves the depiction of the loss of virginity of a college-age woman, though there is no nudity. In this regard, the film perpetuates a myth about losing your virginity -- that it can be definitively determined by bloodshed after intercourse -- that parents should be prepared to dispel. There also is a discussion of an absent parent who did jail time, and there's some profanity (\"f--k\"). Overall, the film has a slow, thoughtful pace that explores the dynamics of a dysfunctional, estranged family's past and a budding young relationship, but these moments give the film much heavier, more mature themes that may warrant discussion.\n|Positive Messages|: The Diary of Preston Plummer espouses positive messages about loyalty, integrity, truth-seeking, and living your life from the point of view of the truth.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters are complex and well-developed, but the film traffics heavily in family dysfunction, secrets, lies, and betrayals. Although a few characters stand out as honest and well-intentioned, others are not what they seem or take some time to root out.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The film contains a graphic suicide scene wherein a man shoots himself in the head in a hotel dining room in front of a room full of people. Though the scene shows the event unfolding in a slightly off-center way, the action is clear, and blood splatters. There also is a shot of a man lying facedown in a pool of blood. There also is a brief scene of a dying man visibly coughing up blood. The discussion of a purported rape and a related civil charge is a major plot point.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The film contains a scene in which a college graduate-age man and woman have sex, with the implication that it's her first time. The pair are undressed down to underwear and fully under a blanket with no nudity shown, but the action is portrayed through breathing and conversation, such as when the woman asks after why there's blood, suggesting she has lost her virginity. Elsewhere, there is some frolicking in bathing suits on the beach, a few scenes of swimming at night in bathing suits, some kissing while characters are lying on a beach on top of each other, and a kiss in a tree.\n|Language|: There is some brief use of casual profanity, such as \"the world is a f--king miracle.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: There are a few scenes of drinking involving college graduates.

The New Orleans-set story is a spin on the classic fairy tale about the princess who finds true love when she kisses an enchanted amphibian, but there's more to this tale than just romance: Tiana is a resourceful, hardworking heroine who's a strong role model and is one of the first Disney heroines who doesn't have to be rescued by a man. While some have been concerned that the movie might reinforce stereotypes -- and it's true that many of the supporting characters feel shallow (and the movie's voodoo subplot is far from subtle) -- overall the film does a good job of adding diversity to Disney's hit parade. But while the movie is kid-friendly on the whole, the villain and his shadowy spirit henchmen can be quite scary, and one important character does die, which makes it a little too intense for the youngest viewers.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: The movie has a heartfelt message about love being the most important thing of all, trumping both financial and professional success. And Tiana is one of the only Disney princesses who doesn't have to be rescued by a man. The movie's secondary voodoo theme, while tongue-in-cheek, plays to assumptions of what New Orleans is like.\n|Positive Role Models|: Much has been made of heroine Tiana, who\u2019s blazing a new trail by being the first African-American Disney princess. She\u2019s a strong role model for girls -- hardworking, loyal, and resourceful -- albeit a relatably imperfect one. She sacrifices some aspects of her personal life in favor of work. Her princely counterpart starts off on shakier ground, seeking to capitalize on his good looks. But in the end he changes into someone more soulful. On the downside, many of the supporting characters aren't very well developed, and some make derisive comments that could be interpreted as being racially motivated (i.e. suggesting that someone of Tiana's background couldn't understand business).\n|Violence & Scariness|: A scary villain (who commands very creepy shadow minions and casts voodoo spells involving the \"other side\") and some cartoonish battling: For example, a man clubs another with a piece of wood, and inept hunters brandish guns and clubs at each other. One throws knives at Frog Tiana. Also, the villain hurts a major character badly. The injury leads to death, which is gracefully handled -- though still pretty intense for a kid-targeted movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Characters kiss when they live happily ever after. The plot turns on a princess kissing a frog. Naveen is quite the ladies' man, but it's mostly shown through very mild flirting.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Tiana is a Disney Princess, whose brand reaches far and wide.

But the movie's skewed humor and its storybook feel lessen some of the impact of the violent scenes.

And there are several chaste kisses between couples, mostly married. Characters drink alcohol and make jokes about Santa's elves smoking too much mistletoe and someone spiking the eggnog. Language includes \"damn it,\" \"damned,\" \"hell,\" \"devil,\" \"wretched,\" \"idiot,\" and \"Dear God.\" Characters put themselves in danger to retrieve a valuable stolen antiquity, but only minor injuries are involved. The main characters represent different races and nationalities, and the film has positive messages about forgiveness, family, love, and marriage.\n|Educational Value|: The film could raise discussions about monarchies, forgiveness, the importance of family, and the meaning of Christmas.\n|Positive Messages|: Forgiveness is a measure of our humanity. Home is where the love is. Kids never get over feeling abandoned by a parent. You have to let people in even at the risk of later suffering loss.\n|Positive Role Models|: The three main female characters all have good hearts and ultimately good intentions, though one is a bit edgier than the others. They look out for each other. Married couples are depicted as loving and supportive \"teams.\" The characters are willing to take some risks to \"steal back\" a stolen relic. A woman with abandonment issues treats others coldly until she's able to open back up to love. Maggie, Stacy, Peter, and Fiona all show compassion and forgiveness for a person who caused them harm.\n|Diverse Representations|: The main characters represent different races and nationalities. The setting is a faux kingdom in northern Europe. A joke is made about inviting a yodeler to perform so as not to offend the Swiss ambassador. A Black bishop delivers a priceless relic from the Vatican. Nuns are depicted in a stereotypical way as old and out of touch.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Security guards are said to have been drugged. Some pratfalls, including a man falling from a rope down the side of a building (he just has sprains). People are chased and escape in a van that tosses them around while driving. A couple worries about their daughter who's flying during a storm. A character suggests a heist could end in death if things go wrong.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some innuendo and flirtation. A woman meows at men, references their abdomens, and flirts shamelessly. A man tries to get a woman up to his room with expensive gifts. Several chaste kisses between couples. One sexy tango dance.\n|Language|: \"Damn it,\" \"damned,\" \"hell,\" \"devil,\" \"wretched,\" \"idiot,\" \"Dear God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Characters drive Teslas and Mercedes Benzes. The film could inspire interest in the earlier Princess Switch films.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink alcohol -- wine, martinis, liquor.

It has positive messages about true love and inherited responsibilities, but some parents may be turned off by the princess theme and the suggestion that ultimate happiness for an average American is marrying into royalty. The film also normalizes living with extreme wealth, though the characters are portrayed as regular people with regular relationship and confidence problems. That said, in one scene the queen's consort convinces her boyfriend that he's not an appropriate match for her because he's just \"a baker from Chicago.\" The villains are exaggerated for humor, though they do drug and kidnap a princess. Nobody is seriously injured in her escape. The heroic characters are all portrayed as compassionate and well-meaning people who are quite innocent at heart. Expect mild innuendo and kissing between married or soon-to-be-married couples. Adults drink champagne and wine at parties. Language includes \"sucked\" and \"hell.\"\n|Educational Value|: Kids could take an interest in the idea of monarchies and coronations. Families could look at a map of the world to guess where the fake countries of Belgravia and Montenaro might be located, based on clues from the film.\n|Positive Messages|: True love conquers all. White lies are sometimes acceptable, but honesty is a better policy, and scheming usually backfires.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main characters are mostly kind, compassionate, and well meaning adults. They behave like regular people despite their royalty and wealth, and grapple with the same problems as anyone else. Margaret realizes she's prepared and confident enough to step into her royal duties as queen. Fiona, her \"minions,\" and Tony are all punished for their wrongdoings, including lying, kidnapping, and attempting to steal money and the crown. Same-sex couples dance at a ball.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mindy and Reggie drug Stacy, drag her into a van, and lock her in a basement. When she awakes, she escapes by knocking Reggie over, dumping Mindy into a box, and racing out into the snow, where Edward and Frank knock Reggie out.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Married and soon-to-be-married couples kiss. A husband makes some suggestive but not explicit comments about things the couple could do together. A man is shown topless. Two women talk about boys being \"hot\" and \"handsome.\" Couples dance together at a royal ball.\n|Language|: \"Sucked.\" \"Hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The film normalizes living with extreme wealth in a royal palace.

The queen's cousin, who quips \"pics or it didn't happen\" before selfies, has wasted her inheritance and hires minions to steal from royal party guests. She also schemes to be crowned queen herself in order to pilfer royal bank accounts, aided by the queen's consort, who complains he's been left with little inheritance but \"expensive tastes.\" A young girl asks a family friend to take her Christmas shopping all afternoon to distract him from something happening back at the palace.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink champagne and wine at events.

Characters make unthinkable choices to find their missing kids, and there's frequent bloody violence. In addition to the central kidnapping of two little girls, people are shot and killed (or kill themselves), beaten to an unrecognizable pulp, and tortured in various ways. One man shoots himself in the head, and a police officer must shoot a suspect. There's frequent strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole\"), as well as excessive alcohol use by adults and some use of pills and other drugs. The movie's disturbing themes and unflinching violence make it best suited for adults and possibly some very mature teens.\n|Positive Messages|: Sometimes otherwise moral people make murky (and even illegal) choices in order to take justice into their own hands -- particularly when their loved ones' lives are at stake. Keller tells his son that the only thing standing between a man and a sudden threat is his ability to protect himself and those he loves.\n|Positive Role Models|: All of the parents in the movie are flawed and confused. They're desperate for their girls and in some cases feel compelled to do unthinkable things to get closer to information on their whereabouts.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many scenes of bloody torture and imprisonment, including close-ups of a chained and brutally beat-up man's face, a young man who shoots himself in the head, a man forced to drink a sedative, a girl who's about to be poisoned to death, the screams and cries of victims, and police killing a criminal. A father yells angrily and curses at his son. People are shot, bludgeoned, tortured with scalding or freezing water, and imprisoned. Young girls are missing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two married couples are affectionate, but they usually embrace out of grief rather than passion. A very brief glimpse of a teen girl in a tub (just her head and shoulders).\n|Language|: Frequent strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn it,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: A few vehicle brands -- Ford Crown Victoria, Trans-Am.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink, sometimes to excess. A priest is so drunk on whiskey that he's basically passed out on the floor, and a man who says he hasn't had a drink in nine years then starts to drink regularly.

Two characters have sex and are intimate in a few scenes (i.e. lying in bed together), though nothing sensitive is shown.

It's just a string of killings and gory bloodshed. There's also some discussion of sex and sexuality, references to underage drinking, and strong language (\"s--t\").\n|Positive Messages|: Some discussion of class; a rival for prom queen notes that \"I just want Crissy to know she can't buy everything.\" Crissy is also referred to as a \"rich bitch.\" And then there are all the killings...\n|Violence & Scariness|: A total of 13 murders, mostly committed with a knife (although there are some stranglings and a shooting as well, plus scuffling, someone's face getting smashed into a mirror, and kicks to the face). Many of the murders occur off screen, and viewers never see a knife cutting or stabbing into flesh, but there's plenty of spurting blood and shots of bloody murder weapons. Several corpses with visible bloody stab wounds or lying in pools of blood are shown.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Cleavage discussed and on display; characters talk about \"alone time,\" \"looking sexy,\" and \"getting laid.\" The protagonist's stalker is clearly motivated by romantic/sexual pathology. A group of older men invite female teens up to their hotel rooms; the young women laugh it off.

The ones who try to take advantage of her inability to consent are in store for an epic reckoning. Sexual assault is at the center of the story, and while none of it comes to fruition on camera, the idea and memory of it live in every frame. The film makes a very clear point about the toxic, sexist culture that allows sexual assault to go relatively unchecked. Cassie is brilliant, cunning, and in control: Her brand of vigilante justice may come across as appealing, but she purposely seeks out very dangerous situations. Scenes show men kissing her and even pulling her underwear down without her OK. This lets the film simultaneously (1) make the point that a woman who drinks too much is never \"asking for it\" and (2) operate as an unforgettable warning to women that doing so can have terrible consequences. Substance use isn't portrayed in a positive light but includes drinking, smoking, and snorting cocaine. Expect strong language (\"c--t,\" several uses of \"f--k,\" etc.) and a shocking struggle that leads to tragedy.\n|Positive Messages|: Creates a powerful, empathetic view of the victims of sexual assault. Condemns rape culture and toxic masculinity. Shows the power of friendship.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cassie is smart, creative, the most loyal of friends; she's also driven almost entirely by revenge. The men she meets/teaches a lesson to range from toxic would-be rapists to \"good guys\" who try to get by with \"boys will be boys\" excuses. Cassie's parents care about her but have no idea how to relate to her. Black trans actress Laverne Cox plays a positive, supportive character who's a successful small-business owner.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intimidating, threatening behavior by the main character. Men try to coerce a seemingly drunk woman into sex; one kisses a woman's legs as he pulls down her underwear without her consent. Verbal threats and arguments. (Spoiler alert!) Forceful struggle leads to a fatal suffocation. Description and audio of a past sexual assault that happened (no visuals), with an emphasis on the emotional and mental distress of the victim and those closest to her. Suicide is referenced.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Joke about anal sex. A developing romance includes kissing, cuddling, implied sex. Sexy shots of a stripper at a bachelor party (she doesn't actually take anything off).

But since it's rated PG-13, all that's shown is a tumble of skin. There's also plenty of innuendo, as well as couple of passionate kisses and a comical scene featuring a flabby exotic dancer in a G-string. Language is the basic PG-13 variety (\"ass,\" \"bitch,\" and \"s--t\" are the main offenders), and there's some social drinking and product placement.\n|Positive Messages|: Lessons about looking past the superficial.\n|Positive Role Models|: Margaret treats employees poorly -- especially Andrew. She blackmailshim into marrying her, and he accepts. But as the movie goes forward,she realizes she can't do something so questionable.

The main character uses his skill at perception to analyze details others miss in an effort to solve a crime, this time involving a friend. His buddy comedy sidekick often is on the receiving end of his quips, but theirs is a genuinely reciprocal friendship that proves valuable to their professional success. The dialogue includes suggestive terms like \"boner,\" \"pubes,\" and \"turned on,\" as well as \"dumbass,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\" Violence is minimal but still shows shootings and a handful of other similar scenes. That said, viewers who are familiar with the show itself won\u2019t find any surprises in the content. Those who are new to the characters and their relationships will probably find it challenging to get up to speed quickly enough to jump into the fast-paced story from the start.\n|Positive Messages|: Shawn\u2019s skills aren\u2019t psychic, but they do make him an exceptional investigator. The guys lie to their respective romantic partners about their work. They have a strong friendship and working relationship.\n|Positive Role Models|: Shawn is a smooth talker who can wiggle out of just about any jam, and he puts that skill to good use. He and Gus leap into action to help an old friend, and they\u2019re undeterred by the challenges the case brings.

Tense/perilous scenes include several duels, an elaborate \"dance off,\" a cannon/gun fight, a \"monster\" chase, and a character who willingly plummets to their death. There are a couple of double-meaning jokes and a repeated mention that Puss is a \"lover,\" as well as a funny conversation about starting a family between the villainous Jack and Jill. Overall this animated adventure is aimed at kids young and old, although families with adopted children should note that (once again) the main character is an orphan. The 3-D factor makes a couple of scenes slightly more intense, but it's nothing overly dramatic, so you won't miss out if you catch it in 2D.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn some words in Spanish that Puss repeats again and again. The relationship between Puss and Humpty will remind children of how peer pressure can go wrong and ruin a friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's positive messages include the power of redemption, the importance of unconditional friendship and the love between mother and child, and how everyone has a choice to make the right decision.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most of the characters -- Puss included -- are rather ambiguous from a moral/ethical perspective: They're outlaws or they're hiding something from others. At least Puss and Humpty's adoptive mother, Imelda -- who never stops missing or loving her sons -- are consistently steadfast. And in the end, Puss, Kitty, and Humpty all redeem themselves in different ways.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few characters are injured (and shown later hilariously bandaged up), and one character decides to let go of another character who plummets to their death. As with all of the Shrek movies, there's peril that features sword play and occasional gun/cannon violence. One tense scene involves characters being pursued by a mysterious monster, who ends up being less scary than anticipated. None of the violence is bloody, but it might upset younger or more sensitive viewers. The main characters are also orphans, which, while practically ubiquitous in animated movies, disturbs some children.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Puss calls himself a \"lover\" and in the opening sequence is shown tip-toeing out of a female cat's house (he \"dresses\" with a belt, hat, and his signature boots). The female cat sighs as he leaves. Later Puss and Kitty Softpaws dance, flirt, and rub noses. At a nightclub full of cats, Puss flirts with the lady cats. Jack and Jill are a couple and are shown in bed together. At one point Jack and Jill discuss the subject of starting a family, and they agree to practice on their little pet pigs.\n|Language|: Mild insults include the puns \"rotten egg\" in reference to Humpty Dumpty, \"bad kitty,\" and Jack and Jill jokes.\n|Products & Purchases|: As a spin-off of the Shrek franchise, this movie has a built-in system of merchandise that includes apparel, toys, video games and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some scenes are set in a pub, where men have steins in front of them, but the only drink viewers see poured or consumed is milk (leche).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776835880197001ec9361b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/quantum-of-solace", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that the second James Bond adventure starring Daniel Craig is, like 2006's Casino Royale, full of non-stop action sequences and has a darker, grittier tone than earlier Bond films. Unlike his predecessors, who barely broke a sweat while sipping their precious martinis, Craig's 007 bleeds real blood and gets into dirty, bare-knuckle, hand-to-hand fights. The violence includes knife fights, gun fights, fist fights, and fire fights. A liked character dies, a woman is tortured (off camera) in a particularly cruel manner, and dozens of characters die in explosions or shootouts. There are a couple of passionate kisses and one scene that obviously takes place after Bond and a woman have had sex (her bare shoulders and back are shown, and he's shirtless). Product placements are mostly cars, like Bond's signature Aston Martin, and language is relatively minimal (\"s--t\" and \"bastard\").\n|Positive Messages|: Revenge, espionage and corporate greed are glamorized.\n|Positive Role Models|: James Bond is largely motivated by a thirst for revenge and seems to have little regard for human life. He does save the life of a character he barely knows, however, because he senses she's in danger. Felix Leiter disregards a directive he feels is immoral.

Guns are a plot point, but no bullets fly here -- just F-bombs, as well as lots of other strong language (\"d--k,\" \"s--t,\" etc.). The film offers diverse representations among the cast; while the movie can't claim to promote the message that crime doesn't pay, teens may garner the idea that there's value in being frugal.\n|Positive Messages|: It's not positioned as a moral, but message may be that our choices (including iffy ones) make us who we are. And two characters have mantras that will likely stick: \"The simplest explanation tends to be the right one\" and \"Watch the pennies, and the dollars will take care of themselves.\" But the film does ask viewers to root for characters who are breaking the law, and there's no takeaway that crime doesn't pay.\n|Positive Role Models|: Postal inspector character shows that those in authority don't automatically mistreat or demean people in pursuit of justice. Other characters aren't role models but do show how, out of desperation, people may justify wrong or illegal behavior.\n|Diverse Representations|: Racially diverse community portrayed. Main characters are both women; one is Black, one is White. Both are struggling to make ends meet. In a representation more drawn from stereotype, a Mexican couple is shown opting to commit crime to escape poverty.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A SWAT team points guns at a suspect. Guns are shown in nonthreatening ways.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A kiss.\n|Language|: Strong language throughout includes \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"idiot,\" \"s--t,\" \"stupid,\" and frequent use of \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Many real products are seen frequently, though mostly incidentally. Some brands (Wheaties, Carefree) get more attention and are important to the story, but there's no endorsement of their use. High-end luxury items are seen.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Smoking, not shown in a glamorized light. Champagne signals celebrating and living the high life.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d8496b655001fe4aef5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/a-quiet-place", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that A Quiet Place is a horror movie about a family that avoids deadly monsters by staying quiet and communicating via American Sign Language. The family survives through teamwork and bravery, even when they're scared or unsure. Expect monster violence, including blood spurts and puddles (a character steps on a nail and leaves bloody footprints), as well as guns and shooting. Children, including a baby, are in peril, and one child is swept away and killed (offscreen) by a monster. A mangled corpse is briefly shown, and characters commit suicide by shouting. There's also some arguing and a few jump scares. A pregnant woman goes into labor and gives birth (offscreen). This is a clever, gripping, satisfying horror movie that should appeal not just to horror hounds but to casual viewers as well. John Krasinski (who also directed and co-wrote) and Emily Blunt co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Bravery and teamwork can overcome difficult odds. It's important to overcome fear and self-doubt. A deaf girl is allowed to be a real character, not defined entirely by her deafness, and characters communicate via American Sign Language.\n|Positive Role Models|: Father shown to be resourceful and caring toward family but also fearless when protecting them. Mother is endlessly brave, also while protecting her children. Violence sometimes required, and children sometimes placed, inadvertently, in harm's way. A character blames herself for a tragedy, and another family member learns that to tell her he loves her means more to her than he can guess.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A young boy is attacked (and killed, offscreen) by a monster; he's quickly snatched away in the blink of an eye. Children in jeopardy. A monster kills a raccoon, with blood spurt. A woman's body is torn to shreds. A bare foot steps on a protruding nail, with blood puddles. Blood puddles in tub.

A baby is also in peril. Guns are fired, entirely at the monsters. There are also jump scares, scary attacks, and general peril and terror. A character softly says what could be either \"goddamn it\" or just \"damn it,\" and \"Jesus Christ\" is spoken once. A bottle of vodka is used to clean a wound but isn't consumed. Sex isn't an issue. The movie is skillfully made, with some amazing sequences, and its pandemic-related images may resonate more with viewers in a post-COVID world than they would have in 2020, when it was originally scheduled for release.\n|Positive Messages|: Champions characters who help one another; those who take rather than help are seen as outcasts and villains. Sometimes you have to find other/creative ways to help people.\n|Positive Role Models|: Regan (a deaf character played by a deaf actor) is an amazing role model: She's strong, resourceful, persistent. Evelyn risks her life to protect her family. Less positive representation includes a Black leader being prematurely killed by the monsters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Child's leg caught in bear trap; blood and gore, screaming in pain.

A flying goose tries to defecate on the head of the antagonist. The movie also talks of how the mother of the lead teen girl died while horseracing.

And before she has the children, she has casual sex, but afterward she is ready for a more complete relationship. An underage couple plan to have sex but are stopped in time.

The main character experiences an identity crisis and ponders life's big questions -- like \"who am I?,\" \"where do I belong?,\" and \"why am I here?\" (to name just a few of Rango's existential issues). There's also stronger language (both \"damn\" and \"hell\" are said several times, as well as insults like \"trollop,\" \"tart,\" and \"floozy\") and notably more violence than in many animated kids' movies -- violent/scary scenes range from gun showdowns and a gallows outfitted with nooses to a frightening killer hawk and a sadistic snake that threatens beloved characters. A few characters are killed (or nearly killed), shot at, or crushed, and there's a fair bit of smoking by supporting characters. But there are also positive messages about living up to your potential, defending those who are defenseless, and the importance of authority figures who do what's in their community's best interest instead of their own.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's messages are mostly philosophical, with the classic \"good vs. evil\" battle (common to Westerns) as one of the overwhelming themes. Rango's character development encourages viewers to think about who they are and what kind of individuals they want to be; the movie also makes you think about what it takes to become a hero and how lawmakers and politicians bear responsibility to protect their constituents.\n|Positive Role Models|: Beans is willing to stand up to the Mayor to fight for her family's farm. Rango overcomes his humiliation to defend the town of Dirt against corruption and ruin.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Notably more violence than in many animated kids' movies, including a near triple hanging (three nooses hang on gallows) and many genre-specific kinds of violence: gun duels, shoot-outs, and more. In fact, characters all have guns, and most of the violence is at gunpoint, except for the very freaky looking rattlesnake, who threatens to squeeze characters to death (his rattle is a gun!). One character walks around with an arrow stuck in his eye (creepy image); another is suicidal. Characters are killed and shot at. A predatory hawk swoops down and picks up prey to swallow; she terrorizes the inhabitants of Dirt and is killed after a spectacular chase. Characters cross traffic dangerously.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild flirting -- first with a headless Barbie and then with Beans, whom Rango obviously falls in love with throughout the movie.\n|Language|: More language than many other animated kids' movies, including \"damn,\" \"hell,\" son of a ...,\" \"tart,\" \"floozy,\" \"trollop,\" \"loser,\" \"I want to see you die,\" \"pathetic,\" and the Spanish words \"cojones\" and \"huevos\" (both of which are included in Mariachi-style songs and are euphemisms for \"balls\").\n|Products & Purchases|: There's a headless Barbie, but the name Barbie is never mentioned; also references to Clint Eastwood and his most famous Western character (The Man With No Name), as well as Pop Tarts.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Many instances of smoking by supporting characters.

There are toilet jokes and gross-out jokes, such as when one character vanquishes a rival by shooting him in the face with milk from a cow's udder. There is racial humor, gun humor, and tons of scenes in which fast-moving cars and buses go off the road and careen down hills. There is drinking, gambling, and a scene in which an escort prices a list of odd sexual services. For all this, Rat Race is cheerfully loony and quite funny, with a brilliant cast and enough jokes that if one misses there's another to get you chuckling again. Unshockable parents will enjoy watching this with older kids.\n|Positive Messages|: The cast boasts racial and ethnic diversity, but there is some mocking of certain ethnicities, most notably Italians courtesy of Rowan Atkinson. Nonetheless, all characters are equally mocked, sending a positive message of unity and respect wrapped in giddy silliness. Many characters are willing to scheme and steal to beat out their rivals, but such scheming usually meets comic comeuppance.\n|Positive Role Models|: All of the characters are lovable (though not very realistic), and generally very sympathetic. At the movie's end, all the characters are called upon to make a difficult, self-sacrificing choice and all opt to do the right thing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Near-constant and sometimes tense cartoonish violence, with many car crashes, a helicopter accident, a monster truck coming within inches of crushing two characters, etc. No one actually gets hurt, however.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An escort is summoned to a hotel room and an unusual erotic situation is priced; a woman flashes a man on the highway and we see her breast from the side; there are numerous references to cross-dressing and several to a racist-sounding porn movie.

Kids will miss most of these references but most likely will still enjoy the plot and animal characters. Not surprisingly for an animated kids' movie, the protagonist, Linguini, is an orphan -- although at least he's a young adult and not a child. There's some moderate peril involving the rats and weapon-wielding humans that may frighten sensitive and younger viewers; the sewer sequence is particularly tense and potentially scary, as is the gun-toting grandma. Two characters kiss, and there are a few mild insults, such as \"stupid\" and \"loser,\" and one \"hell.\"\n|Educational Value|: Kids can't help but pick up a few pointers on cooking and food, but the movie's primary intent is to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Linguini learns to give credit to his rat pal, and Remy realizes that his family connections are more important than his human ones; together, they work as a team to succeed. On the downside, two chefs in the kitchen are very hostile to Linguini, which could make some kids uncomfortable. Themes include perseverance and integrity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Remy doesn't let the fact that he's an unconventional chef prevent him from following his dreams, and Linguini learns to stand up for what he believes in. They both make mistakes, but they learn from them. There are several jokes at the expense of the French (\"Sorry to be rude, but we're French\" and so on).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Remy is hunted by an angry, gun-toting grandma and knife-throwing chefs. A gun is fired. One chef is rumored to be an ex-con and looks menacingly at the rest of the kitchen staff. Characters crash through windows, are struck by lightning, are hit, and are trapped.

Set in the fictional land of Kumandra, which is based on real Southeast Asian cultures (including Thai, Malay, and Vietnamese), the movie follows Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran), who for years has tried to find a way to reverse a scary, curse-like plague known as the Druun, which takes the form of relentless purple-and-black blob monsters and turns anyone it touches into stone. Awkwafina co-stars as the voice of Sisu, the last surviving dragon, whom Raya recruits to help in her quest. Grief is a major theme of the movie, and several characters talk about the loved ones taken by the Druun, including children who've lost parents and entire families. Scary sequences involve characters fleeing for their lives from various dangerous situations, including both human enemies and the Druun. There are intense close-up fights with swords/blades, and a skeleton is visible in one sequence. In another scene (spoiler alert), a main character is struck by an arrow and presumed dead. In one very emotional scene, characters willingly sacrifice themselves to the Druun; young viewers may believe they're dead. The movie emphasizes the importance of trusting others and overcoming prejudice to find common ground. And Raya is a standout role model who exhibits courage, teamwork, and perseverance.\n|Educational Value|: Audiences will be exposed to a non-specific blend of Southeast Asian cultures and will learn about courage, teamwork, communication, and perseverance.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong theme of importance of trust. Lasting messages about impact of grief and acknowledging how those you love are a part of you. Lessons about courage, teamwork, perseverance. Shows the need to overcome prejudice and assumptions to find commonalities with others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Raya is brave, selfless, generous, and kind -- also suspicious and wary of accepting help, but she learns the importance of teamwork. Sisu is powerful and courageous but also sweet, forgiving, trusting, and empathetic. Namaari is loyal and persistent but also deceptive.\n|Diverse Representations|: Raya is the first Disney film to focus fully on the cultures of Southeast Asia. The characters are all voiced by Southeast Asian and Asian actors, and the script was written by Qui Nguyen (Vietnamese American) and Adele Lim (Malaysian American). However, there's little in the movie that specifies different cultures and peoples from this diverse region of the world, which could lead young Western viewers into thinking that cultures as different as Thai and Vietnamese are pretty much indistinguishable.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Electric-purple blob monsters -- the manifestation of a plague known as the Druun -- attack relentlessly at every opportunity, turning people and dragons to stone. Central characters are impacted; some sacrifice themselves (i.e., willingly turn to stone) to save others. Many have lost loved ones (including children who are without parents/family members). A main character is struck by an arrow, presumed dead. People fight with bow and arrow, swords, knives, other blades. Close-contact combat/violence. Characters must run to escape capture. Dangerous pursuits on ground, at sea. Glimpse of a skeleton. The Fang warriors ride scary big cats.

Expect both virtual (i.e., in the Oasis) and real-life violence, although the movie's real-world violence isn't quite as traumatic as the book's. The in-game action can get pretty intense (especially when seen in 3D) and includes over-the-top shoot-outs (with every kind of weapon imaginable), all-out attacks, large-scale battles, destructive car chases, giant monsters, and a frightening re-creation of a gory horror film that includes ax attacks, zombies, and more. Outside the Oasis, there are assassination attempts, an explosion that kills civilians and destroys homes, forced labor, a car chase, and gun threats. Characters also flirt, kiss, and touch each other suggestively, and there's quite a bit of swearing (mostly \"s--t,\" though there's a memorable use of \"f---ing\"). Although fans of the book, gamers, and Gen Xers with '80s nostalgia are the most obvious audience, you don't need to have read the book to understand or appreciate the story (in fact, if you haven't read it, you're less likely to be distracted by the massive story changes made for the movie...) and its themes of teamwork, perseverance, and valuing real-life connections.\n|Positive Messages|: Ultimate message is that games, movies, TV shows, other forms of popular culture definitely matter, but consuming them shouldn't be more important than connecting with people, fostering friendships, finding love in the real world. The Oasis -- a symbol for various forms of online culture -- is both a blessing and a curse; it's a powerful tool, but it can also isolate people. Also promotes teamwork and perseverance, taking calculated risks, researching, practicing, and studying to become an expert/skilled in a particular field.\n|Positive Role Models|: Wade/Parzival triumphs in the Oasis despite disadvantaged upbringing, thanks to his discipline in studying Halliday's life and interests. He's quick thinking, focused, and friendly in the virtual world. Women/girls can play and participate in and succeed in the Oasis as well as men/boys, and Art3mis is intelligent, proactive, committed, and hardworking (though she also defers to Wade in some areas where she doesn't really need to). Aech is a skilled fighter and a loyal friend to Parzival. Avatars come in every shape, size, and color in the Oasis; real-life characters also show a range of representations.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many action-packed battle/fight/destruction scenes in the Oasis, a few in real life. In the Oasis, Parzival and friends must survive enemy attacks in the form of dinosaurs, King Kong, and other players targeting them with arsenals of virtual weapons (from guns and swords to grenades and world-leveling bombs). Scary re-creation of a horror film includes a literal flood of blood, ax attacks, frightening/gross zombies. Intense car chases/crashes. Characters die frequently in the Oasis (often brutally), breaking apart and turning into coins, which \"zeroes out\" their avatars. In the real word, an evil corporation sends assassins to kill and/or arrest people, put them in debtors' prisons, blow up their homes, pursue them in armored vehicles, and shoot at them. Gun threats. Creature from alien pops out of an avatar's stomach in a jump-scare moment.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Virtual flirting, dancing, touching, including a moment when Art3mis touches Parzival seductively (in his crotch region) and asks whether he can feel it in real life with his high-tech suit (the corresponding area of his suit glows red); he says of her \"she's hot.\" A few big kisses. Brief innuendo about the kinds of things you can do in the Oasis; some avatars wear pretty skimpy outfits. During one of the key challenges, a naked woman gets out of a bath and approaches a character's avatar; her bare back/top of her buttocks is shown. A woman mimes pole dancing while plugged into the Oasis.\n|Language|: Many uses of \"s--t,\" plus the occasional \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"dickweed,\" \"douche bag,\" \"balls,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"pissed,\" \"ghetto trash,\" \"noob,\" etc. And there's one momentous use of the word \"f---ing.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nonstop references to movies, video games, directors, and '80s pop culture. The movies The Shining and Back to the Future play a pivotal role, and there are glimpses/mentions of Atari, Dell, Apple, Minecraft, Firestone tires, Batman, Iron Giant, Robert Zemeckis, John Hughes films, Tab cola, Pizza Hut, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Empty/half-filled wine glasses in a post-office party flashback scene.

There's minor name-calling such as \"freaks,\" \"babies,\" \"stupid,\" or \"punks,\" a precarious near-fall from a roof, and some mild bullying that mostly involves exclusion, but the main characters work to divert those forces for the greater good. Otherwise it's a fast-paced, hyper-smart, and refreshingly gentle size-up of the politics and power plays of middle school that features smart, diverse kids and adults who are a tad oblivious but eventually come around to seeing things from the kid's perspective. Perfect for the age it dramatizes.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Standing up for your beliefs; the power of negotiating; trying to understand where kids are coming from; the little guy can make a difference; treating kids younger than you with respect; seeing other points of view.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kids are simplistic but diversely portrayed and well-intentioned, and they fight for things they believe in.

Mild bullying consists of calling other kids \"dumb\" or \"young.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: A kid hangs precariously from a rooftop but is rescued.

The action sequences may be accompanied by plenty of laughs, but the body count is high and the weapons military-grade. On the plus side, there's no overt sexuality, and the language is standard issue for the rating (\"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" etc.). Teens will also take away the positive message that senior citizens can still \"kick butt\"; it's good for kids to realize that the elderly aren't all meek and frail -- most of them had long (and in this case exciting) careers before they retired.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's message -- that senior citizens are still vibrant and useful -- is a worthwhile take-away in our youth-obsessed culture. Although there are some obvious conspiracy-theory messages about defense contractor firms and the government, overall the story is about retirees you wouldn't want to mess with. On the downside, the way that Frank and Sarah's relationship starts (with him drugging and abducting her -- with the goal being to rescue her) is pretty iffy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sarah trusts Frank enough to help him uncover the truth. Frank embarks on a fact-finding mission to clear his name and save himself and his friends from being murdered; another character selflessly agrees to sacrifice himself to ensure that the mission can go forward. Marvin overcomes his fears to join the RED team.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of violence and a high body count. Once the protagonist is first ambushed, barely a scene passes in which people aren't trying to kill or not be killed. People are shot to death, blown up (quite vividly), stabbed, hanged, and burned. Severed fingers are shown, and a couple of scenes include bloodied characters (especially when shot) and heavily bruised ones. Weapons include everything from everyday office supplies to rocket-propelled guns, and you'd probably need a military background to identify everything in between.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Hand-holding, a couple of passionate kisses and embraces, and one early scene in which a female character undresses down to her slip. One character stares at a woman's bottom. Two characters' romantic relationship begins when one ties the other up and drugs her as part of a rescue.\n|Language|: Words like \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"a--hole\" are used infrequently; one \"f--k.\" Also \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mostly cars like Volvo and and the Chevy Tahoe, as well as an older Chevrolet sedan.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adult characters drink socially and do shots of vodka in a couple of scenes. There's also a reference to the many years that Marvin was given LSD as part of a military experiment. One character drugs another as part of an abduction/rescue -- the drugged character makes a reference to feeling \"high\" when she wakes up.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769b5ad5437001f765974": {"verified": false, "updated": "2022-07-28"}, "plex://movie/5d77704481ba41001faec15d": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/red-notice", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Red Notice is a globetrotting action-adventure starring Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot, and Dwayne Johnson.

Inspired by the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible story of the prophet Hosea and his marriage to Gomer, the story takes place in 1850 during the Gold Rush. Farmer Michael Hosea (Tom Lewis) prays for a wife and falls for Angel (Abigail Cowen), the highest-earning sex worker in Pair-a-Dice, California. The movie, like the book, deals with heavy subjects including child and domestic abuse, forced prostitution and human trafficking, and more. The film has strong, clear faith-based messages and themes of compassion, empathy, and perseverance, but there's also partial nudity, kissing, and non-explicit sex scenes, as well as several sequences that take place in brothels. Violence is pervasive, too, with the threat of/references to child and adult rape, pedophilia, incest, brawls, beatings, domestic abuse, and murders, including a lynching. Adults drink, and language includes \"son of a bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"whore,\" and other insults.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's messages include the importance of redemption, faith, and honesty. Unwavering belief in God and unconditional love for your spouse are also major themes. Overt Christian messages through on-screen prayer.\n|Positive Role Models|: Supported by his faith, Michael loves Angel unconditionally (and unrelentingly). No matter how many times she wrongs him or leaves him, he remains loyal and loving. He's also hard-working and disciplined. Angel has survived very difficult circumstances and grows to believe herself worthy of love. Lucky and Mai Ling are kind and look out for Angel. Paul starts off angry and mean, but like Angel, redeems himself through faith and love. Other characters are sadistic and cruel, like Duke and his goons.\n|Diverse Representations\n\n\n      \n          Flagged for concern|: Most of the characters are White Americans (a few are identifiably of Irish heritage). Chinese and Black actors play sex workers, a maid, and unnamed clients of a sex worker.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character orders someone to kill an unarmed man in front of a little girl, as well as to kill another woman and to burn down two establishments. A madam's hired muscle bloodily beats up a woman. A child hears her father beating her mother (off camera); the mother later sports a black eye. Angel is a sex worker who's raffled off in a daily lottery for her services. A man threatens to rape a woman. A character is hanged by a mob. Two people are killed by fire. A pedophile \"owns\" a young girl and displays her at a brothel. Brothel owners are abusive toward their sex workers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A sex worker is known to have had sex with hundreds, if not thousands, of men. She's displayed in a window, and in various scenes, nudity is partial or implied (i.e. her hair covers most of her breast, but the sides are visible, or she covers herself with shawls, robes, or blankets, but it's still clear she's topless). Several kissing scenes and at least three love scenes between Angel and Michael; shoulders and backs are visible, and some quiet moaning and heavy breathing can be heard. A sex scene takes place off camera; the participants adjust their clothes afterward.\n|Language|: Language includes \"son of a bitch,\" \"whore,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn fool,\" \"you're a dirt farmer,\" \"hell.\" One use of \"My God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink at taverns, brothels, and dinners.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776836eb5d26001f1e0f2c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-rescuers", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Rescuers isn't as accessible to the youngest viewers as many other Disney features -- its dark story (a suspenseful tale of child kidnapping and slavery) may be too much for sensitive preschoolers.

Language is also very strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. There's a brief moment of full-frontal male nudity, and some whisky drinking is shown.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a revenge movie, with no other character traits in evidence other than the hero's dogged pursuit and the villain's greed and cowardice. In the end, the need to see that revenge through to the end personally is questioned.\n|Positive Role Models|: While Hugh Glass is sympathetic for the way he appreciates nature and doesn't judge people by race -- and his skills as a frontiersman are undoubtedly impressive -- his main role in the film is seeking vengeance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Men are shot through with arrows, and various body parts are hit (faces, limbs, etc.).

Richie is a kid who doesn't have any normal friends (his school friends are freakishly precocious in cultivating their inner Donald Trumps). So his butler gets the \"townie\" kids to come over, and Richie blows them away by sharing his toys (a kid catapult, a roller coaster, an in-home McDonald's).\n|Positive Messages|: Mired in the depts of all of the product placement is the message that the Rich family values the things that are sentimental in value, rather than those silly material things that they spend so much time and effort accruing. Cute and maybe a little endearing, but confusing.\n|Positive Role Models|: Role models go both ways. Richie is a good guy underneath the trappings of all of the riches. Just like his dad, who wants to keep Union Tool company in business just so people can keep their jobs. Meanwhile, though the Riches do love each other, their excess distracts them from spending that most precious of commodities: quality time together.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are pistols, machine guns, and lasers, which are used at close range. Though no one is killed, there are many perilous scenes, including a plane crash where the victims land safely in the water and a scene where a group of kids are about to be destroyed by a molecular reconstruction machine.

There are a couple of frightening characters -- most notably a scary white cockatoo who relishes harming his fellow birds -- and a few bird smugglers (though most of them are dimwitted and not nearly as cold-blooded as their hench-bird). A couple of birds try to give the main character advice on how to attract his potential mate, and there are many sightings of men and women in skimpy/skin-tight Carnival costumes. Both the main lovebirds and their owners fall in love, so there are a few scenes of flirting and embracing, plus one brief kiss or nuzzle. Characters also use some insulting words, such as \"idiots,\" \"stupid,\" \"losers,\" and \"shut up.\" Linda and Jewel are strong, selfless female characters who are willing to put themselves at risk for freedom (and their loved ones), and kids and parents will learn a good bit about Brazilian customs, particularly Carnival, and what makes Rio such a unique place. Note: The movie is playing in 3-D in some theaters, which makes some scenes more vivid/intense.\n|Educational Value|: There are environmental lessons about the importance of wild birds and about trying to keep animals safe from smuggling. Kids will also learn about Brazil, especially the Rio Carnival.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has plenty of positive messages about broadening your horizons, believing in yourself, helping others even when it's dangerous, and caring for the beautiful animals in our midst instead of stealing and selling them for profit. The subplot with Fernando also teaches viewers that no matter how difficult your life is, you can still make good choices and turn your life around.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite the presence of the smugglers and their evil hench-bird, Nigel, most of the movie's role models are positive. Tulio and Linda both love birds and tirelessly work to find Blu and Jewel and provide them with a sanctuary. Blu puts his fears behind him to help save Jewel, and Jewel is a strong female character who isn't afraid or a stereotypical damsel in distress. Young Fernando shows remorse for having helped the bird smugglers and teams up with Tulio and Linda to rescue the blue macaws.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Human smugglers trap and steal various exotic birds (chaining them together in cages), but it's white cockatoo Nigel who's most likely to upset kids. He's very mean and nasty, getting a group of small monkeys to help him by threatening to throw them from great heights and watch them plunge to their deaths (he drops one as an example but saves him at the last minute). The monkeys and birds fight at a party, but no weapons are used. Nigel also chases the macaws and their friends, and he squeezes or stamps on other birds. He sings a scary song about being evil, and he's called a cannibal for eating a chicken wing in front of the other birds.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Many animated women (and men) are scantily and provocatively dressed in Carnival costumes (bikini-clad bottoms are prominent in some scenes). Tulio and Linda flirt with each other and eventually hug and kiss (once, briefly). Same for Jewel and Blu, who spend most of the movie chained together but grow to have feelings for each other. There are a couple of jokes about mating and continuing the species, but younger kids won't get them. There are also jokes about how everyone in Rio dresses in barely there costumes. Nico and Pedro try to give Blu advice about how to seem attractive to Jewel.\n|Language|: Occasional use of insulting language like \"idiots,\" \"stupid,\" \"useless,\" \"dumb,\" \"losers,\" \"butt,\" and \"shut up.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769ec594b2b001e6ae1da": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/rio-2", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Rio 2, the sequel to 2011's hit animated adventure Rio, is another colorful, musical tribute to the natural beauty of Brazil, this time in the Amazon. Although the human threats are less scary here than in the original movie, there are now potentially frightening scenes of wild Amazon predators (jaguars, crocodiles, etc.) swallowing their prey. It's portrayed comically, but it may still upset some kids. Nigel, the vain villain from the original, is back, now with a poisonous frog sidekick who's more than willing to do his bidding. Still, despite the predator-prey scenes, this is a lively musical adventure that's perfect for families who enjoyed the first Rio.\n|Educational Value|: Young viewers will learn environmental lessons about the importance of wild birds, keeping the rainforest safe from logging companies that destroy natural habitats, and information about various parts of Brazil shown in an entertaining musical sequence.\n|Positive Messages|: Plenty of positive messages, both environmental and personal. The story teaches kids the importance of the Amazon and keeping wildlife habitats safe from destruction and stresses the necessity of a close family and a home where you can be yourself. The movie also encourages viewers not to judge others by superficial differences, because characters who seem dangerous might not be and might actually be a friend or ally.\n|Positive Role Models|: Blu and Jewel are wonderful parents who teach their children different sets of skills -- both an appreciation for the domestic world and their wild habitat. The kids are all smart, active, and curious juvenile birds. Linda and Tulio have the birds' and the Amazon's preservation in mind. Eduardo and Roberto are brave leaders who want to keep their blue macaw community safe. Gabi's obsession with Nigel (to the point that she's willing to help him poison and kill if she has to) is funny but also borderline disturbing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Nigel has a one-track plan to poison and kill Blu. His beloved poisonous frog companion is always willing to donate her poison for the cause. The blue and red macaws threaten one another and engage in a winner takes all \"turf war\" that turns out to just be an aggressive game of soccer. In an extended scene, loggers fight the birds with cranes and other construction vehicles, while the birds peck and descend on them. The loggers also tie up Linda and Tulio and leave them to the elements. Lots of physical comedy and a sequence in which animals keep getting eaten/killed (albeit comically) by predators in the Amazon (but later those same animals are shown miraculously fine). The bad guys are creepy looking and mean.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Blu and Jewel are married, as are Linda and Tulio. They're affectionate and kiss a couple of times. Jewel's childhood sweetheart Roberto is called \"sexy\" and \"hot\" and preens around her, making Blu jealous by singing, dancing, and saying things like \"If anything happens to you, I'll take care of your family.\" Gabi the poisonous frog sings a slightly creepy love song about wishing she could be with her love, Nigel.\n|Language|: Insults like \"idiot\" and \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Rio has merchandise tie-ins to video games, apparel, and stuffed toys. One of the macaw kids listens to music on her iPod.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults are shown with champagne glasses.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768c5fb0d55001f519286": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/rise-of-the-guardians", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Rise of the Guardians is sort of like The Avengers with childhood icons: Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman. There's lots of action and some mild violence revolving around the menacing bad guy Pitch Black, who turns children's dreams into nightmares with his cavalry of scary stallions (some scenes may feel more intense in the movie's 3-D version). (Spoiler alert!) One Guardian is destroyed but comes back to life at the end of the movie. There's some insulting language like \"coward\" and \"selfish\" and \"go suck an egg,\" and in a flashback, a main character drowns but transforms rather than dying. Whether they personally believe in these characters or not (and the nontraditional way they're portrayed here could get some of them wondering...), kids will root for the Guardians as they fight the forces of chaos and despair.\n|Educational Value|: More for entertainment purposes than educational, but there's an interesting folkloric origin story to how these childhood icons were endowed with the protection of children's hopes and dreams.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie stresses the importance of the wonder of childhood, including belief in Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, etc. Preserving the innocence and joy of childhood is the reason the Guardians exist. Although the movie isn't religious, the idea of faith in something you can't necessarily see is demonstrated as a positive force in children's lives.\n|Positive Role Models|: All of the Guardians are strong and brave and ready to do what's necessary to protect children. The Tooth Fairy and her adorable little fairies keep baby teeth because they store children's precious memories. Santa loves providing toys because they spark imagination and wonder in kids. The Easter Bunny's eggs represent rebirth and new beginnings each spring. Jack's journey is to discover how he fits into the group and what makes him worthy of joining them.\n|Violence & Scariness|: (Potential spoiler alerts!) Some intense action. Pitch Black and his minions are able to destroy one of the Guardians. The other Guardians begin to lose their powers as children stop believing in them. Pitch cleans out the Tooth Fairy's castle, breaks all of the Easter Bunny's eggs, and generally breaks the hopeful spirit of all the children he encounters. He undoes the work of the Sandman so that kids have nightmares instead of sweet dreams. Pitch's shadowy black stallions can be frightening. In a flashback, viewers see that the boy who was Jack Frost drowned saving his sister and then transformed into the icon of winter. Santa uses swords.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The Tooth Fairy seems smitten with Jack Frost, and a couple of her \"baby\" fairies swoon in his presence. In one brief scene, Tooth and Jack share a moment of staring in each other's eyes.\n|Language|: Australian Easter Bunny says \"bloody\" this and \"bloody\" that fairly frequently; Pitch Black tells Bunny to \"go suck an egg,\" and some insults are thrown back and forth, including \"coward.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placements in the movie, but there's a good bit of Rise of the Guardians merchandise available, from plush sets and figurines to games, apparel, calendars, and more. The story is also based on a book series.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768a1594b2b001e691724": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an origin story that's less sci-fi and more relationship drama, making it a surprisingly equal-opportunity choice for teens and parents. There's not much language, sexuality, or drinking, but the animal-human violence gets intense in the second half of the movie. Humans are afraid of the apes, so they shoot and poke them, and the threatened apes react defensively by smashing cars, throwing spears, pushing police officers off a bridge, and generally wreaking havoc on the Bay Area. There are a few pivotal death scenes for both species, but the movie's focus is less on the action and more on the nuanced question of how animals and humans can co-exist once there's no intelligence barrier.\n|Positive Messages|: There are some thought-provoking messages in the movie, especially the idea about whether it's questionable to test animals with drugs that could injure them if it's for the benefit of curing human diseases. Animal equality is brought up via both the character of Caesar, who's of superior intelligence to his human age-counterparts, and the misery of the apes held imprisoned in the animal shelter. Will's decisions to keep Caesar, give his father the experimental drug, and bribe an official show the moral ambiguity of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. The tension between the pharmaceutical industry's drive for profits versus the good of helping the sick is another major theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite keeping Caesar and giving his father drug-trial medicine illegally, Will is a hardworking visionary who wants to help cure diseases at work and comes home to take care of his ill father. He's not perfect, but he's disciplined, kind, and intelligent. Caesar himself is more \"human\" than some of the human characters. He's thoughtful, generous, and thinks everything through strategically. He only uses violence when threatened, as opposed to for sport.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In the opening scene, ape poachers are shown trapping apes in nets and chasing them with machetes and guns; shortly after that, a lab ape gets very aggressive with the scientists and is eventually shot and killed. The ape-versus-human violence is usually in retaliation for human-on-ape violence, and it includes apes grabbing and nearly breaking someone's hand, Caesar biting the hand of a neighbor who's pushing his owner, and apes fighting off police officers who surround and shoot them from a helicopter and the ground. The goriest scenes are of a man who's electrocuted (he's hosed down as he turns an electric stunning device on), a police officer who's thrown off a bridge by a gorilla, and a man plummeting into the water from a falling helicopter. An ape also dies protecting his leader. An elderly man succumbs to illness in his sleep, while a contaminated human dies from a strange virus.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple of sweet kisses and some flirting between Will and Caroline. They live together (it's not clear whether they're married), and they're shown in bed, but only sleeping.\n|Language|: Language includes one use of \"s--t,\" plus infrequent use of \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"damn\" (as in the famous line: \"Get your damn paws off me, you damned dirty ape\").\n|Products & Purchases|: The only brand prominently featured is an Apple MacBook/desktop computer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A primate shelter worker and his friend are shown with drinks in their hands.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b94fb0d55001f56c0be": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/risen", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Risen is a Biblical drama set during the days before and after the death of Jesus Christ; it focuses on Clavius (Joseph Fiennes), a Roman soldier who tries to make sense of  seemingly impossible events. While there's no swearing and only a little bit of subtle innuendo, there's lots of graphic violence, in both battle scenes (slashing with swords and spears, bashing heads with rocks and clubs) and crucifixion sequences (detailed discussion and demonstration of precisely what's involved), though relatively little blood overall. Some characters also get drunk on wine.\n|Positive Messages|: Open your heart and mind to accept the seemingly impossible, and they may be possible after all.\n|Positive Role Models|: Clavius is an intelligent skeptic who's initially unable to make sense of what he's seen because it seems impossible. But eventually, he accepts what his eyes tell him and in the process realizes he must reevaluate many of his fundamental beliefs.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many scenes with combat and punishment, including people slashing each other with swords and spears and bashing heads with rocks and clubs (though overall things don't get that bloody/gory). Several sequences include detailed discussions and demonstrations of precisely what's involved in crucifying a person -- and the resulting slow, gruesome death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Subtle innuendo.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Scenes show people drinking wine and occasionally acting drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768374de0ee001fccc010": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/robin-hood", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Robin Hood is an animated 1973 Disney version of the classic tale of robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. There's some cartoon violence: Characters battle with bows and arrows, axes, knives, and swords. References to a noose and hanging. There's some slapstick violence, typically involving Prince John and his snake assistant Sir Hiss. Speaking of, in one scene, Sir Hiss is shown hiding out in a bottle of ale, then later reemerges with glazed eyes, slurred speech, and cartoon bubbles that represent drunkenness. In another scene, Little John is dressed as a female fortune teller, and hides gold coins down the front of his disguise, causing his top to swell as if he has large breasts, causing Prince John's guards to hoot and wolf whistle. Parents and families can use this as a chance to talk about how the people who are supposed to be the \"good guys\" engage in bad behavior, and it's the outlaw \"bad guys\" like Robin Hood who do the right thing, particularly for those less fortunate.\n|Positive Messages|: Ultimately, Robin Hood and his Merry Men demonstrate empathy to care about those less fortunate, and use their skills to fight back against economic injustice.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although Robin and Little John are technically outlaws, they're clearly well meaning; they engage in theft, duplicity, and pranks, but all in good humor. Prince John is the pinnacle of poor character: vain, greedy, gullible, and temperamental with a habit for thumb sucking.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon violence throughout. Characters fight with bows and arrows, flaming arrows, swords, axes. Slapstick fare with medieval weaponry; Prince John has a sadistic tendency to strike his courtier Hiss. Characters are held at knifepoint. References to a noose, hanging.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: While dressed as a female fortune teller, Little John hides gold coins down the front of his outfit, causing his chest to expand as if he has large breasts, causing Prince John's guards to hoot and wolf whistle.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: After Sir Hiss ends up hiding out in a barrel of ale, he reemerges with glazed eyes, slurred speech, and cartoon bubbles representing drunkenness.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768fd96b655001fdc756e": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/robocop-2014", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Robocop is a remake of the 1987 action classic that's less bloody than the original, but still fairly violent, with intense, frequent gun battles, thousands of bullets flying, and dead bodies (with very little blood shown). We briefly see gory photos of the main character after an accident, and his organs are shown inside the RoboCop armor. There's one moment of sexuality as the main character, still a human, kisses his wife and falls onto a bed with her (she is shown wearing a bra). Language is infrequent, but includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" as well as \"bitch\" and \"a--hole.\" (One use of \"motherf----r\" is bleeped out.) In one scene, RoboCop arrests some drug dealers/users and then busts a drug lab. Overall, it's not nearly as good as the original film, but it's a solid effort.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has two big themes. One is a question of humanity: how human is human, and where is the line drawn? The sub-theme is one of politics: how much freedom should one give up for the promise of safety? The movie also has something to say about greed: the employees at the company building the robots seem to be more interested in profits than in making safe machines.\n|Positive Role Models|: It's hard to argue for RoboCop as a role model, since he's both so tormented and so emotionless, and also because he's sometimes prone to unprovoked violence. But on a very surface reading, he's a pretty cool superhero, and one that tries to uphold the law.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie is filled with guns, shooting, and dead bodies, but it just barely achieves a PG-13 rating by showing hardly any blood. There are a few cuts and scrapes shown, and when one character is shot, we see a spray of blood (and a pool of blood from under his corpse). Thousands of bullets fly in this movie. Suicide bombers are part of the story. A robot shoots a teen boy holding a knife (he's determined to be a \"threat\"). The hero is caught in an explosion, which ravages his body. We see brief images of his wounds as well as his organs inside the RoboCop armor and some creepy \"operation\" footage. RoboCop sometimes beats people up with his hands, rather than with his guns.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Before the accident, when the main character is human, he is shown passionately kissing his wife. He removes her top, and she is shown wearing a black bra. They fall onto the bed, kissing, but they are interrupted.\n|Language|: Language is infrequent, but includes a few uses of \"s--t.\" Other words include \"a--hole,\" \"holy Christ,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" and \"bitch.\" A TV commentator uses the words \"motherf----r\" and \"horses--t,\" but these words are bleeped.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: RoboCop catches some young men doing a drug deal.

There's a little potty language (\"booty,\" \"fanny\") plus some potty jokes, including an extended fart joke sequence. There's also some mild sexual humor, including jokes about cross-dressing and \"fixing\" a dog. Great messages abound about following your dreams and not giving up.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: In this familiar story with a twist (robots instead of people) there are several clearly stated messages: \u201cFollow Your Dreams\"; \u201cNever, Never Give Up\"; and \u201cYou Can Shine No Matter What You Are Made Of.\u201d When the greedy corporation adapts the slogan \u201cWhy be you when you can be new,\u201d the heroes counter that slogan and everyone learns the value of repairing and revitalizing the old, sturdy favorites. Themes include perseverance, courage, and compassion.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rodney Copperbottom is a hero who is smart, loyal, compassionate, courageous, steadfast, and doesn\u2019t give up no matter what the odds. His father\u2019s greatest gift to him is believing in his son and letting him go out into the world to prove himself and realize his dream of making the world a better place. The two villains are greedy and care nothing for their fellow robots. Rodney has a group of friends who also prove their loyalty and individual worth.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon chases, falls, captures, and battles take place. Because all the players are robots, the most serious threat is that of being melted down in a \u201cchop shop\u2019s\u201d fiery oven and turned into scrap metal. Many of the action sequences are funny in that the characters' vulnerable body parts are metal and made of a variety of ordinary objects (pots, pans, screwdrivers, utensils). The two villains, a mother and son combination, are greedy, ruthless corporate types who may look or sound scary to the very youngest viewer.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some flirtatious behavior between two sets of characters. A very few humorous sexual references (i.e. cross dressing) that will most likely go over the heads of most youngsters.\n|Language|: No actual swearing or coarse language with the exception of a short sequence of farting, which includes a fart contest.

Although the Star Wars franchise is popular with fans of all ages, this installment gets quite violent (somewhat more so than 2015's A Force Awakens), with scenes that make painfully clear the sacrifices and casualties necessary in a war against tyrannical evil. There's a high body count, as well as violence that's both large-scale (even the Death Star's early, limited attacks cause mass destruction) and up close and personal. On the other hand, the cast is very diverse, and there are many admirable role models, particularly brave, tough, capable Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). And the movie's story repeatedly demonstrates the importance of trust, friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, and doing the right thing.\n|Positive Messages|: Ongoing struggle between the forces of good and evil, light and dark. Also a nuanced message about how both sides can have immoral, unreasonable rules that people shouldn't blindly follow. Jyn's parents' story makes it clear that not everyone rebels in the same way. The importance of trust, friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, and doing the right thing are demonstrated again and again.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jyn is brave, tough, and more capable than most of the men around her. Cassian is a courageous rebel fighter who makes difficult choices to disobey orders when necessary. Two Imperial soldiers (one an officer, the other a pilot) choose to subvert the fascistic Empire's rules/orders. A warrior monk is blind, but that doesn't keep him from being a superb fighter. This is the most diverse Star Wars cast to date, with rebel fighters from various cultures. Like other Star Wars films, this one follows a person (in this case Jyn) with an extraordinary ability to unite and fight for a cause.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie has a high body count that includes both major and minor characters. Not a lot of blood or gore, but many to-the-death battles and shoot-outs, and a couple of uses of the Death Star's \"planet killer\" force that causes mass destruction. Quick glimpses of both dead stormtroopers and rebels, as well as dead civilians lying around. In one scene, a character narrowly saves a crying young child from certain death. In another, a young girl sees one parent get killed and the other taken; she ends up hiding for her life in an underground hiding space. A character uses mind control to hurt someone. A character is tortured with a huge creature that invades his mind to see whether he's telling the truth.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters are obviously attracted to each other (they stare at one another longingly and speak in close quarters); they finally embrace in a climactic scene.\n|Language|: \"Traitor,\" \"thief,\" \"criminal.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera, nothing; but the Star Wars universe has tons of merchandise -- including branded/themed apparel, games, accessories, housewares, action figures, toys, and just about anything else you can imagine.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77684f85719b001f3a83b5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-ron-clark-story", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that in this made-for-TV movie, Clark's students have difficult family lives.

Together, they write their own code about friendship that makes Ron one of a kind. The movie explores issues of class (Barney is the last person in his school to get a B*Bot) and the proliferation of technology, social media, and screen time among tweens and teens. While there's little in the way of violence or scariness, you can expect instances of school bullying (a boy is even ridiculed while on the toilet) and brief moments of light peril as a team infiltrates a company to save the day. There's also some rude language (\"sucks,\" \"freakin',\" etc.) and bathroom humor, including a meme about a \"Poop Girl\" and a toy plastic unicorn that \"poops\" glittery slime. The movie stresses the importance of real-life friendships, of accepting others who aren't like you, and of family-wide compassion, empathy, and teamwork. Olivia Colman co-stars as Barney's grandma, and Ed Helms voices his dad.\n|Educational Value|: Mostly intended for entertainment, but viewers will learn a bit about marketing and technology use, as well as teamwork and communication.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages parents and kids not to rely too heavily on technology for friendship and happiness, while also acknowledging positive aspects of technology and social media. Stresses importance of real-life friendships, of accepting others who aren't like you, of family-wide compassion, empathy, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Barney is loyal and loving but also lonely.

The movie features a great deal of suggested violence (particularly rape), as well as an upsetting scene of the kidnapper yelling at and injuring Ma. There's also an incredibly tense sequence when Jack attempts to escape from his captor and another scene in which a character is shown having overdosed on pills (she survives). Along with the violence, there's some strong language, including nearly a dozen uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more. But in the end, despite their horrific circumstances, Ma and Jack have a beautiful, incredibly close relationship that's hopeful and inspiring.\n|Positive Messages|: The bond between parent and child is so strong that it can create meaning in otherwise-hopeless situations.

Also suggests that young women should be kind but have a healthy distrust of strangers' intentions.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jack is intelligent, curious, and kind. He loves his mother, who's also his best and only friend. Ma teaches Jack and makes sure he's active and learns, even in their horrible situation. Both of them are very brave, though at one point Ma attempts suicide. Ma's mother is patient and loving after reuniting with her daughter and meeting her grandson.\n|Violence & Scariness|: It's obvious that Ma has been systematically raped and intimidated for her seven years of captivity. She's also been injured and beaten, but mostly sexually assaulted during her time in the shed (during one assault, Jack is hidden in a wardrobe and hears noises).

There's some minor language (\"damned,\" \"suckers,\" \"freakin,\" \"crap,\" \"holy moly,\" \"stupid,\" \"Oh my God\"), light kissing, and some stereotyping about the poor and the wealthy. Adults drink wine on a couple of occasions. The film and diverse cast of characters ultimately convey a repeated message about showing compassion for others, especially when injustice is uncovered.\n|Positive Messages|: Love is essential to life. Having more money or possessions doesn't necessarily make you happier. When you see injustice, you should try to do something. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to help others. Some stereotypes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Izzy is devoted to her family and her coworkers at the salon. She's a beloved member of her community and treats everyone with dignity and respect. She's compassionate to others who have even less than she does. Thomas struggles to feel treated or spoken to honestly by others, but he hasn't taken the effort to look beyond the life he's been given, and his parents use him as a pawn.\n|Diverse Representations|: Lots of racial and cultural diversity in the cast. Working-class people are portrayed as barely getting by financially but still satisfied with what they have and generally happy and supportive of each other, while the wealthy are depicted as just wanting to maintain or improve their status. The two main characters want to help fight social and class injustice. A main character is gay, though this is only revealed through a story toward the end.

While it initially treats physical differences as undesirable, it ultimately has a great message about nonconformity: Just be yourself, don't worry if you don't fit in, and there's strength in teamwork. Rudolph and friends show courage and perseverance to defeat the Abominable Snow Monster and save Christmas. Kids will likely get the message, and even for the youngest ones, the cute little reindeer and musical numbers -- as cheesy as they might seem now -- will hold their interest. Even the show's \"scary\" villain, the Abominable Snow Monster (or \"Bumble\") becomes a friend in the end. All of that said, the film has outdated gender and race representations and sexist comments that parents should point out to kids.\n|Educational Value|: The film is intended to entertain, rather than educate, but kids may learn why physical differences are special and being yourself is a good thing.\n|Positive Messages|: Just be yourself, don't worry if you don't fit in, get the support of others and you'll find that there's strength in teamwork. Rudolph and his friends show courage and perseverance, and their differences, which are initially made fun of, become assets.

But Rudolph and his friends show courage and perseverance, and their differences -- which are initially made fun of -- become assets.

Comments about \"getting the women\" to safety, Donner as \"man of the house,\" and Mrs. Donner not being allowed to search for Rudolph because it's \"man's work.\" Female characters have fewer lines than male characters and are mainly defined as wives, mothers, and girlfriends. Rudolph is initially laughed at, called names, and excluded for his physical difference. Even though the film goes about it in a flawed way, differences are ultimately shown as positives that should be valued and celebrated. Two Indigenous characters are stereotypically depicted as \"Eskimos\" and briefly shown in an igloo.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mild peril, mostly related to the Abominable Snow Monster. He has a scary growl and attempts to eat Rudolph's family. Rudolph and friends fight him by pulling his teeth and pushing him off a cliff.

With very little iffy content, it transforms and pokes fun at what may worry some parents about the sport. Because the wrestlers are large, unrealistic creatures, they seem much more likely to be able to endure the hard hits and pile drivers that happen in the ring. Some characters, including muscle-bound champion Tentacular (voiced with relish by Terry Crews), have pretty oversized egos and exchange over-the-top smack talk. By contrast, the main characters -- human teen Winnie (Geraldine Viswanathan) and underdog monster Steve (Will Arnett) -- are humble, demonstrating strengths like perseverance. What all three have in common, though, is trying to figure out how to step out of the shadow of former legends in their sport who were idolized in their city. The story begins nine years after deaths of these big names, so there is a theme of loss, but characters are no longer grieving. There's notable positive diversity throughout, including strong, smart women and people of color.\n|Educational Value|: To improve in an activity that doesn't interest you, mix it up with an activity you do enjoy. Offers the insight that some wrestling matches are real and some are not (i.e. they have planned outcomes).\n|Positive Messages|: Blaze your own path. To succeed, you must put in the work.\n|Positive Role Models|: Winnie is a fantastic role model and example of perseverance. When everyone in her town is willing to give up, she takes it upon herself to find a solution and in doing so finds her calling. She's a confident teen who's aspiring to being a coach in a male-dominated field; she believes in herself, offers great analysis, and refuses to be dismissed. Winnie's mother is loving and supportive. Once Steve starts to truly work with Winnie, their teamwork yields success.\n|Diverse Representations|: Positive gender and racial diversity in both the animated characters and voice-over cast. Teen main character and her mother are people of color (their ethnicity is never specified). The intimidating boss of an underground wrestling operation is female, as are many of Steve's tough wrestling competitors. Steve is less concerned with muscle and aggression and loves to dance, which counters common gender stereotypes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick cartoon wrestling inside the ring. During a match, a folding chair is thrown and (comically) hits someone in the stands, who at the end of the film says \"I'm OK, for those who were worried!\" Wrestlers are oversized monsters, but only the menacing boss who issues threats while filing her sharp talons is at all scary.

High school student Zoe (Isabel May) fights back against a gang of her peers, led by Tristan (Eli Brown), who wants to secure his own notoriety and immortality by committing mass murder. Violence is frequent, graphic, and bloody, as many characters are murdered in cold blood. Explosions kill and injure people. In an early scene, Zoe is shown shooting dead a deer. The movie does little to try to understand either the victims or the perpetrators. But Zoe does begin to deal with grief she is suppressing after the death of her mother. There is a strong gender balance in terms of roles with not just Zoe but also other female characters shown to be intelligent, pragmatic, and brave. However, Zoe is shown to have a sadistic and vengeful streak, while Tristan is portrayed as being a psychopath. A female teacher is forced to remove her top and bra -- there is a brief glimpse of her breasts. There is also a brief scene where a character exposes their bare backside for comedic effect. Cellphones are a vital part of the plot, as Tristan and his gang live stream their attack. One character is shown smoking cigarettes. Due to the sensitive nature of the movie, families are advised to watch the movie with caution.\n|Positive Messages|: Facing your fears, fighting for survival, dealing with grief. But also using vengeance to resolve situations.\n|Positive Role Models|: Zoe is forthright and independent. But she sometimes struggles with interpersonal relationships, including those with her family members and close friends. She also struggles to fit in at school. This is made worse by her not being able to properly process the death of her mother. A small of group of high school students murder their schoolmates. Their leader, Tristan, is particularly remorseless and appears to be a psychopath. He also displays patronizing, sexist attitudes toward Zoe. Both Zoe and Tristan display little sympathy or understanding of those who do not think or act as they do. Strong female representation -- female characters have knowledge of hunting, mechanics, science, and music. Also strong diversity among the cast, including a gender balance and multiple ethnicities represented among the main and supporting characters.

It depicts their athletic skill and determination, but it's also about their dark sides: their excesses, dirty tricks, and personal failures. In other words, they aren't anywhere near the squeaky-clean role models parents might be hoping for. The movie includes several car crashes, with blood and bones shown, and a very intense sequence in which one character is badly burned. Language is very strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"c--t.\" Hunt sleeps with many women, and some female toplessness is shown (Lauda's girlfriend is also shown topless.) Hunt is also shown drinking to excess, smoking cigarettes, and briefly smoking pot. Finally, it's no secret that racing is all about merchandizing, and many brand names are shown throughout, including Coca-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes.\n|Positive Messages|: Two race-car drivers discover that rivalry increases their drive for competition -- not necessarily the healthiest lesson, as it leads to destructive behavior. On the surface, this is also a movie about fame and success and how, if they're allowed to run rampant, they can destroy relationships. Success is shown as a big trophy, some champagne, and lots of parties, as well as the realization that it's fleeting.\n|Positive Role Models|: The two main characters are real-life champion race-car drivers, and they come with a certain amount of hero worship. Their athletic skills are impeccable, and they have an intense drive to succeed, but their behavior is often destructive and disrespectful. But it's shown that the men's relationship is, on a deeper level, complicated and respectful.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The most intense sequence takes place when Niki Lauda suffers a fiery crash and burns in his car for almost a minute. In the hospital, he's shown burned and scarred and later with fresh skin grafts on his face. There's also a horrible procedure in which a tube is shoved down his throat to suck black gunk out of his lungs. Several other crash sequences are shown, with blood and broken bones.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character, James Hunt, has sex with many, many women over the course of the movie. Some sex scenes are shown, and others are implied. He's shown kissing women and in bed with them. Some female toplessness is shown. Niki stays with one woman throughout, and she's also shown topless.\n|Language|: Language is very strong, including fairly frequent uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"c--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"balls,\" \"prick,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"Christ\" (as an exclamation), and \"turd.\" A middle finger gesture is used.\n|Products & Purchases|: Racing is all about sponsors, and many corporate logos are (realistically) on display throughout, including Marlboro cigarettes, Goodyear tires, Coca-Cola, Levis, Shell, and STP. One character drives for Ferrari. There's an early speech about trying not to use sponsors, but eventually this idea goes by the wayside.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The main character is always sober before a race, but afterward, he drinks a great deal (champagne, various kinds of hard liquor), sometimes to drunkenness. He also smokes cigarettes frequently, and he and other characters smoke pot.

While the romantic stuff is pretty tame for teens, save for one session in bed that reveals bare shoulders, the film does deal with heavy subjects such as death and spousal abuse. One character clearly has an alcohol problem (he's shown drinking while driving), which colors his decisions at work and at home. He also turns violent, resorting to guns and worse. There are also scenes with a destructive fire and a bloody knife, as well as some swearing (\"s--t\" is the worst of it).\n|Positive Messages|: Safe Haven's message is heartwarming to the core: Surround yourself with kind, good people, and you can emerge from the darkness that you may find yourself in.

A gun is shown, and there's some fighting; a supporting character dies. A young man and a young woman kiss; she's also shown in a bikini and a tight tank top.

Set during the early 1960s, it follows a new kid in town (Tom Guiry) who makes friends by joining a local pick-up team. The main threat to the gang's happiness is The Beast -- a giant, slavering dog on the other side of the sandlot fence (he might briefly scare younger viewers). Strong language includes \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and lots of colorful insults, and there are some scuffles between the boys. Adults may also raise an eyebrow at the way the movie treats a much sought-after, slightly older lifeguard \"babe.\" Boys ogle her with typical preteen interest (and one tricks her into kissing him), but it's the camera that unnecessarily lingers on her various body parts. Family relationships are also somewhat strained (particularly between one of the boys and his indifferent stepdad), but friendship plays a strong role and comes off in a very positive light. Overall, the movie has a sun-kissed, nostalgic tone that both kids and parents will appreciate.\n|Educational Value|: Kids are bound to pick up a few baseball-related tips and rules.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages about friendship and loyalty. Family relationships are more complex, but characters' intent is generally good.

The story is filled with cheery messages about caring for others and sharing our gifts, with a little touch of empowerment by way of Kris's determination to do the right thing, even when it means arguing with a mean and misguided mayor. Parents and kids alike will delight in the story's take on how established Christmas traditions (Santa's red suit, gifts under a tree, and the date of Christmas itself) came to be. There are some tense moments between Kris and Winter before the holiday spirit warms the warlock's heart, but only your littlest tots might be temporarily frightened by them.\n|Educational Value|: The movie tells a version of the story behind Santa's fame, explaining how popular traditions like putting gifts in stockings and Santa's Nice List came to be.\n|Positive Messages|: The story's themes include kindness, generosity, and sensitivity to others' needs. A villain experiences of a change of heart when he's on the receiving end of a kind act, and, despite a few pitfalls, the deserving heroes prevail to spread joy and happiness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Kris and his family and friends do what they do to make others happy with little thought of themselves. They do break established rules to do it, but even kids will understand that those rules were unfair and inspired by the mayor's selfishness.\n|Violence & Scariness|: No violence, but Winter starts out as a curmudgeonly and occasionally menacing-looking character before softening into a kind-hearted friend.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One quick kiss between Kris and his wife.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f34fed74e6700200202df": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-santa-clause", "cs_age": 9, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 9+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Santa Clause is a 1994 Christmas-themed movie in which Tim Allen plays a toy industry executive who transforms into jolly old Saint Nick himself. The original Santa Claus takes a fatal, accidental fall (yikes -- Santa dies!). Guns are drawn as Tim Allen's new \"Santa\" gets arrested by police. There are grown-up (and gross) jokes, and the movie deals with divorce and estrangement between a father and son. While the whole plot revolves around the idea of Santa being real, many characters talk about the fact that he might not be -- so this may not be the best fit for families looking to extend kids' belief in St. Nick. There is also some potty humor involving human and reindeer flatulence, as well as a vague reference to being on drugs in the 1960s.\n|Positive Messages|: The religious significance of Christmas takes a big back seat to present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment. Predictable, forced message on giving as exemplifying the \"true spirit of Christmas.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: While the lead character begins to exemplify the spirit of Christmas giving and selflessness as he transforms into Santa Claus, this is done through no conscious effort on his part; he becomes Santa by virtue of accidentally killing the previous Santa and finding his business card. The other lead characters are too one-dimensional to be seen as positive role models. Some attempt is shown to convey the reality of Christmas for the child of divorced parents who share equal custody.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The original Santa Claus takes a fatal, accidental pratfall. Guns are drawn as Tim Allen's new \"Santa\" gets arrested by police.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: As he begins his transformation into Santa, the lead character makes a suggestive remark to an attractive woman on the sidewalk.\n|Language|: One distantly off-color joke about whether a sexy grown-up has been \"naughty\" or \"nice.\" Some flatulence humor. \"Hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Denny's is mentioned by name and featured in a scene. Several FedEx trucks park outside a home.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Vague gag reference to the main character's 1960s drug use. Drinking at a corporate function.

Some potty humor is included, such as flatulence jokes and a brief close-up of the exposed rear end of the robotic Santa Claus replica (also played by Tim Allen). After chugging a large mug of cocoa, the robotic Santa does an exaggerated imitation of someone who has just had a shot of alcohol, talks of \"feeling a little buzz.\" A teen character acts out by vandalizing school property. There's some pratfall violence: A character falls over a railing and downstairs after trying to yank out his tooth by tying the tooth to a toaster and dropping the toaster. While the movie has strong, intelligent female characters, the elves (played by children) conform to 1950s-era stereotypes, with the boys creating toys and playing football while the girls deliver the cookies and cocoa. There are very few minority characters, and the movie doesn't acknowledge any other religious or cultural holiday traditions.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Some expected messages on the true meaning of Christmas.\n|Positive Role Models|: No real positive messages.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Teen shown committing acts of vandalism -- defacing school property with graffiti.

A reindeer learning how to fly knocks his passengers into cars and mailboxes. Teens throw snowballs at the principal's house.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: When the newly created robotic Santa emerges from the North Pole assembly line, it's a near exact replica of Tim Allen as Santa Claus; there's a very brief shot of the robot's rear end, intended to be a moment of humor.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Product placements for McDonald's and Nestle.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The robotic Santa, after chugging a large mug of cocoa, talks of \"feeling a little buzz\" while shaking his head and acting like someone who just drank a shot of alcohol.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683a7e9a3c0020c6de00": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-santa-clause-3-the-escape-clause", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that kids will probably be eager to see the third tale in this fun, tame holiday movie series.

There's no sugar-coating, no \"cartoon violence,\" no nameless, inconsequential casualties like LucasFilm Imperial Stormtroopers. This is unrestrained, ugly, and dirty combat, meant to make the viewer appreciate the monstrous human cost and tragic sacrifice of the Allied beachhead -- a price mostly paid by young men. Stunned, vengeful U.S. soldiers are seen committing what would be considered atrocities (shooting surrendering Germans, as well as innocent non-Germans who can't speak English). Even though characters are religious -- one prays fervently before killing with his sniper skills -- everyone swears a lot, too. Some \"special editions\" carry supplementary documentary material, including clips of Steven Spielberg's own 8mm war movies he made as a kid.\n|Positive Messages|: Some themes of courage and teamwork are present, but also cowardice and the breakdown of discipline. Parents may want to discuss with kids whether \"glory\" is really attained on the battlefield -- and if military might and conflicts can ever be positive things.\n|Positive Role Models|: Capt. Miller is here a paragon of military discipline and fairness, though he too weeps when a friend is killed. He explains in a key moment that in peacetime life he's a schoolteacher, not a career soldier. Even though they bristle at their mission, the men carry out the assignment, at great personal risk. One shows mercy to a German and comes to grievously regret it. Others shoot defenseless and surrendering enemy without thinking twice. Though the platoon is of mixed backgrounds (Jewish, Christian, Italian-American, Appalachian), all are white, which accurately reflects the racially segregated U.S. forces at the time.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Graphic, savage battlefield violence, as men are blown up, shot, and dismembered by artillery fire, and bayoneted, beaten, and stabbed in hand-to-hand fighting. Unsparing death comes to sympathetic characters as well as ones we hardly know.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Dirty jokes and salty stories cracked by members of the platoon.\n|Language|: Lots of F- and S-words, \"asshole,\" God's name in vain (or prayed to before killing), and the profane military acronym F.U.B.A.R. is eventually explained.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Social drinking, smoking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f3582ca3253001ef29562": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/scared-shrekless", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that for kids who are familiar with Shrek and his pals, there\u2019s nothing in Scared Shrekless, but it's a very funny Halloween special.

Expect a fair amount of the trademark potty humor (vomiting, pooping, and the like) that Shrek is famous for, as well as one very subtle bit of sexual innuendo. Of course there\u2019s also the major marketing tie-in as well, since Shrek\u2019s face graces everything from lunch boxes to loungewear, but more than anything, families should prepare to laugh at this treat of a Halloween special.\n|Educational Value|: The show intends to entertain rather than to educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Shrek and his friends are good-humored and mostly embody positive traits of friendship, loyalty, and reliability.

Exaggerated cartoon violence -- falls, fierce fights, in-your-face scares, blood, monsters and skeletons, burning, gunfire, gross-out wounds -- is continuous, with no serious injuries or deaths. Obscene language and swearing is also non-stop (i.e., \"f--k,\" the \"N\" word, \"s--t\"), with jokes and sight gags about racial discrimination, religion, disabilities, ejaculation, rape, penis enhancement, homosexuality, masturbation, and more. There are multiple scenes depicting simulated sex (including oral and anal) -- all with comic intent. Alcohol consumption and drug use are also treated as farce. Not to be left out, vomiting, peeing, farting, and pooping are awarded lots of screen time.\n|Positive Messages|: The messages presented here aren't meant to be positive.\n|Positive Role Models|: Promotes \"diversity\" in that race, gender, sexual preference, and handicaps are all made fun of equally, and all become the butt of the jokes and physical comedy. Stereotypes rule here. Girls often are braver than their male counterparts.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of violence that is never meant to be taken seriously. The hapless teens trapped in the haunted house are attacked by: a ferocious cat, a skeleton, an out-of-control marijuana plant, a cackling ghost, dueling wheelchairs, an invisible rapist, blow-up breasts, furniture and chandeliers, and a disfigured caretaker. Spooky music, slamming doors, fog, screaming, and ghoulishly-leering characters are meant to heighten the phony suspense. Creepy images: a man with the top of his head cut off, a vomit contest, weird protruding nipples, a demon girl in dire need of an exorcism.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Continuous farcical sexual images, innuendo, and dialogue. Extended simulated sex, including oral sex, masturbation, homosexual and heterosexual foreplay, occurs throughout. Three girls wear sexy bikinis in one scene, and one young woman wears revealing clothing all the time.

The film's comic sensibilities rely on potty humor (pooping, peeing, farting, vomiting, snot), sexual innuendo and suggestive visuals (dogs copulating, large jiggling breasts, bare butts), and low-brow parody (racial stereotypes, a pedophile priest, people with disabilities). There are fewer obscenities than in the earlier films, but still plenty of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" and an occasional \"f--k.\" Drinking, drug use, and smoking are occasional, intended as over-the-top humor.\n|Positive Messages|: Some racial humor. There are jokes about drinking, smoking, drugs, sex, race, drunk driving, pedophile priests, gang shootings, barfing, menstruation, testicular cancer, bestiality, and people with disabilities.\n|Positive Role Models|: Always with comic intent, the film mocks stereotyping even as it perpetuates it: black characters are armed and dangerous; women are dumb; Asians are bad drivers; priests are pedophiles.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick throughout. Characters (including one hapless little boy who is continuously battered ) are decapitated, hit by cars and falling objects, knocked out, crash through windows, shot at, kicked in the groin, and attacked by corpses and zombies.

No actual sexual activity other than some slobbery kisses and shots of dogs copulating, but innuendo along with sexual language, jokes, and leering are frequent.

There is occasional profanity -- some of it spoken by 10-year-olds -- and Black's character freely discusses his hangovers with the class he's teaching. There are brief shots of adult characters drinking and smoking (this is about playing rock 'n' roll, after all), but nothing terribly gratuitous. Beyond this, School of Rock is an enjoyable way for kids to learn about music, and for families to talk about the amount of work and personal satisfaction that results in starting a band. Furthermore, the film addresses body issues in a positive way when one of the girls in class is afraid to sing because she thinks she's \"too fat.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Hard work, practice, and dedication are a huge part of any success. It's important for kids to follow their dreams and to apply their talents to their fullest potential. An emphasis on finding your passion and giving it your all. Also, in a comedic manner, the roles of different instruments are discussed, and the film does touch on the work and practice required to be in a successful band. Dewey gives a body-positive pep talk to a girl who's feeling embarrassed about her weight.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dewey starts out as a slacker and misleads others for his own gain. But as the movie progresses, he finds real joy in working with kids and finds ways to be supportive and inspiring to them, and he's ultimately selfless. Characters learn and demonstrate self-control, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Early in the film, a character dives off a stage. No one catches him and he lands on his face.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nothing at all, though one girl says groupies are \"sluts.\"\n|Language|: Occasional profanity: \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"pissed.\" A 10-year-old uses the word \"stupid-ass.\" Early in the film, the main character uses an obscene gesture, sort of. A child talks about \"sluts\" briefly.\n|Products & Purchases|: Band stickers are pretty much everywhere.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: As some of the film is set in rock clubs, characters hold beers and cigarettes. During one scene, Dewey has a beer with the principal of the school. The principal starts to act tipsy, but that could just as easily be the effect the Stevie Nicks song on the jukebox has on her.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768333c3c2a001fbcdc89": {"verified": false, "updated": "2022-07-28"}, "plex://movie/5d776d7423d5a3001f523571": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/scooby-doo-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Scooby-Doo & Batman: The Brave and the Bold is an excellent animated crossover with mild comic book violence and threat.

The fight scenes involve kicking and punching, but no one comes to any serious harm. Threat includes characters being chased through a burning warehouse. Younger viewers could find the movie's floating phantom monster scary. A chimp detective with an English accent uses the term \"bloody\" on several occasions. There is also mild flirting between characters.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can start to think about word puzzles.\n|Positive Messages|: Communication and teamwork: a crime fighting organization presents mysteries to another group -- together they try to solve them. Batman shows empathy when he recognizes Aquaman feels left out of the group.\n|Positive Role Models|: Batman is a dedicated crime fighter who works to keep his city safe. He feels guilt about a person he thought he couldn't save. The entire group of Mystery Analysis of Gotham work together and help each other, drawing on their individual skills.

The campers and counsellors are a multicultural group who generally work together to make the camp experience worthwhile.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Any movie that features an ax-wielding maniac is bound to have a few scary moments.

Frankencreepy is jam-packed with comic spookiness, action, monsters, and creepy bad guys.

The movie includes all the \"gothic\" people and events a fan could dream of: Dr. Frankenstein's monster, the von Dinklestein Curse, a spooky castle, a ghost, a hunch-backed assistant, and a menacing housekeeper, as well as townspeople out for vengeance. Although Velma's family history is the engine for this movie's plot, Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo all take center stage at times for their usual individual nutty and endearing behavior. Daphne, whose vanity and pride in her appearance is key here, is cursed by \"losing her good looks.\" The visuals of her weight gain and a specific reference to dress size, though mocking that vanity, may perpetuate unrealistic and undesirable standards of beauty for girls.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.

Characters encounter an assortment of villains, including a Frankenstein-like monster; the metal-faced ghost of a baron; Iago, a cackling, hunch-backed scientist's assistant; a scary housekeeper; and Velma, who for a time is turned into an evil scientist by a curse.

As in most of the Scooby gang's escapades, there are some moments of tension and peril, but no one is seriously hurt. In this story, Velma flirts with a like-minded young scientist, and the two go out to dinner and even briefly touch hands. But forget fledgling romance: Scooby and his four teen mates are all about crime-solving collaboration.\n|Educational Value|: This is definitely an entertainment-only movie, but conversations about various dinosaurs and their attributes could be educational for budding paleontologists.\n|Positive Messages|: Scooby-Doo and his teen pals are always there to help protect each other. They're unconditional friends who use teamwork to solve mysteries and help strangers.\n|Positive Role Models|: It may not be obvious, but the four teens represent how very different people can still be great friends, and they're all clever or helpful or brave in their own way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The \"phantosaurs\" aren't just spooky ghost-like apparitions; they roar and run and cause people to hide. There are also very real-looking dinosaurs running around frightening the locals. In one scene, Shaggy, who's been hypnotized to become a \"fearless hero\" whenever he hears the word \"bad,\" gets into a tussle at a diner, where he leaves things in disrepair.

Mr. Hyde, the movie's villain, has a scary hound and releases bats that cause a great deal of destruction, but no character is gravely injured. The Mystery Inc. gang represents how even very different teens can still be good friends and work as a team to defeat criminals.\n|Educational Value|: Like most Scooby-Doo movies, this one is for entertainment, not educational value.\n|Positive Messages|: The Mystery Inc. pals always espouse the virtues of teamwork, collaboration, and friendship. They are a diverse group of teens with different personalities and strengths, but they always work together to solve the mysteries and save the day.

Scooby and Shaggy, more than their friends, have to overcome their fears to face down villains.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mr. Hyde is a frightening character with bats and a hound that can do his destructive bidding.

Moon Monster Madness is a typical Scooby-Doo franchise release. Familiar quirky members of Scooby's gang solve a simple mystery with an ample supply of comedy antics, parody of existing cultural icons, and cartoon action. Besides the usual explosions, chases, bumps on the head, and narrow escapes, this entry's central villain is a black, reptilian, fanged alien monster who is a menacing presence in many sequences. It may be too scary for very young kids or sensitive kids who aren't comfortable with imaginary jeopardy. Straightforward messages about teamwork, coping with fear, and self-confidence are delivered with humor. Some stereotypical characters (astronauts, an alien resistance fighter, a media tycoon, and a football player) are satirized with good-natured humor.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: If you put your mind to it, you can do anything. Teamwork and respect are important qualities. It's important not to argue; better to work together against a common threat. A strong heroic character reveals that he has fears like everyone else; it's crucial to learn how to handle fear.\n|Positive Role Models|: Classic Mystery Inc. roles: Velma -- brainy, insecure; Daphne -- pretty, vain, friendly; Scooby and Shaggy -- unmotivated except by food; Fred -- handsome, a bit dim. Together they call upon their better selves (resourceful, courageous team players) and overcome petty jealousies to achieve a common goal. An enormously large and strong African-American football player defies stereotyping when he admits to being afraid of a lot of things and needing support. Wealthy businessman is prototypical braggart and egomaniac.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon scares, mostly from what appears to be an alien monster, who menaces the spaceship in which the gang is traveling and later on the moon. It's a black, reptilian wraith-like demon with sharp teeth, a horrible roar, and glowing red eyes. It flies through the air, chases the heroes, damages the spacecraft, and scares the passengers in numerous scenes. No substantial injuries or deaths. Other potentially frightening moments: pounding footsteps, explosions, heroes trapped in space. In a cartoon-within-a-cartoon, the gang imagines comic alien attacks on humans; they battle and defeat the not-so-scary aliens using their unique skills.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Discussion of the wearing of \"atomic\" diapers and emptying the resulting \"payload.\" Name-calling: \"four-eyes,\" \"you're crazy.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The 23rd direct-to-DVD and streaming entry in the Scooby-Doo franchise, which includes toys, products, games, TV shows, and so on.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f35ca6fc551001ef82b0c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/scooby-doo-music-of-the-vampire", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this animated adventure features the typical components of a Scooby-Doo mystery: frightening creatures that are actually people in disguise, mild flirting, creepy characters, and violent scenes. Families who don't like paranormal themes should know that the movie centers around vampires. There's a somewhat disturbing subplot involving Daphne being kidnapped and offered up to a vampire as his eternal bride, and there's a lot of flirting, dancing, and touching in one sequence. The violence -- including stakes being thrown and a scary, screaming vampire -- will likely frighten younger kids.\n|Educational Value|: This isn't an educational film, unless you count familiarity with how to kill a vampire.\n|Positive Messages|: Scooby-Doo and his teen pals are unconditional friends who use their various talents and smarts to solve mysteries together and help rescue strangers. They're willing to put themselves in harm's way as long as it will help solve the case -- or a friend.\n|Positive Role Models|: What's great about the Scooby gang is that they're all so different yet manage to be close friends who work well together. They use their different skills to complement each other when working on a mystery. Sometimes (well, a lot of the time), Shaggy and Scooby are frightened, but eventually they rise to the occasion and push through to act bravery.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Paranormal characters may automatically frighten younger viewers unaccustomed to vampires. The first time viewers see the gang, they're fighting a huge cockroach monster that's very scary but turns out to be a man in costume. The vampire that comes to life screams and turns into a bat. A woman gets rich selling stakes, garlic, and other ways of killing vampires or keeping them at bay. In one scene, Fred nearly kills all his friends when stakes from a makeshift weapon start flying out. A swamp seems to swallow a man, but he doesn't die as imagined. Vampire-obsessed friends are willing to exchange Daphne's life for immortality.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A young actor flirts with Daphne and kisses her hand. Fred acts jealous. A guy talks just centimeters from Daphne's face, swings her around on a rope, and then touches her possessively. They dance, and he picks her up and proposes an eternal marriage with her. Daphne is kidnapped and nearly becomes a vampire's bride. Daphne is told she's beautiful and has the countenance of a queen -- a vampire queen.

But for kids who are comfortable with pretend vs. real violence, there are no true scares, and the suspense is minimal. No one is injured or killed. In addition, there are funny send-ups of juvenile internet stars and movie producers and a competitive sister relationship.

Scooby and the gang also must venture down a long corridor to rescue Shaggy, a corridor filled with traps that set off swinging axes and arrows. After offering Shaggy a job in Waste Management, King Arthur makes reference to \"a few ripe buckets of...\" before he's cut off. Some bodily function humor, such as Merlin burping the alphabet.

The Wrestlemania pay-per-view event, many of the WWE character \"brands,\" and the action in the ring, feature prominently throughout the film, filtered through the prism of the typical Scooby-Doo mystery formula of bad guys dressed as monsters, meddling kids, and Shaggy and Scoob ever on the lookout for snacks. There is also, predictably enough, frequent wrestling-style violence, both in and out of the ring. Some of the demonic and nightmarish images make this film a bit much for younger viewers.

The sexuality includes some passionate kisses and a couple of hooking-up scenes (both gay and straight); in one scene, a couple ends up in bed -- she in her bra, he shirtless -- but no sex is shown on screen. One character explodes after unexpectedly having an instantaneous orgasm. Language includes some uses of words like \"s--t\" and \"ass,\" and there's one character who says \"f--k\" several times, though they're mostly bleeped. All of the violence is stylized and cartoonish rather than realistic and bloody. And for a geeky-hipster tale, there are remarkably few product placements.\n|Positive Messages|: Utlimately the movie's message is that you have to harness the power within yourself to be powerful -- you have to know who you are to figure out what you want. Teamwork is also encouraged.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although Scott's circle of friends is mostly loyal to him, no one in the movie is truly selfless. Scott himself cheats on Knives, who then hates Ramona and wants to get revenge. Ramona, in turn, doesn't adequately prepare Scott for the fact that he has to defeat her many exes for them to be together.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The six big face-offs are staged like video game battles, with lots of almost cartoonish martial arts and hand-to-hand fighting. There's no blood, but the defeated exes do blow up, disappear, disintigrate, etc.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Scott barely holds hands with Knives, the girl he's dating at the beginning of the movie, but he does hook up with Ramona in a scene that shows them both in bed and half-dressed (though they never have sex). Scott's roommate, Wallace, ends up in bed with not just one but two guys, one of whom started out being a girl's date (no sex is shown on screen). Wallace is also shown making out a couple of times. Scott and Wallace share a bed but have a platonic friendship. One of Ramona's evil exes is a \"bi-curous\" girl; Scott defeats her by touching her in an innocuous place that makes her have an instantaneous orgasm and explode. Scott's band is called Sex Bob-omb.

Also words like \"c--k,\" \"boob,\" and \"bang\" and insults like \"loser,\" \"creep\" and \"slut.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Fairly moderate for a teen-targeted film: a Sharpie T-shirt, Amazon, mentions of Pac Man and other video games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Several scenes take place in nighclubs or concert venues where people have bottles in their hands, but there's no drunkenness.

In the hands of new filmmakers, the meta-horror idea still has enough juice to produce a lightly flawed but wickedly entertaining shocker for mature fans. Violence is extremely strong and over the top, with lots of blood: spurts, sprays, and gurgles. Expect to see guns and shooting, characters dying, repeated stabbings, fighting, kicking, and punching, etc. Language is also quite strong, with many uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and more. There are several instances of sex-related dialogue, and two scenes with kissing, plus a discussion about \"going upstairs.\" Teen drinking is briefly seen at a party, and there's dialogue about teen drug use and alcohol dependency (many liquor bottles are shown).\n|Positive Messages|: Somewhat unexpectedly, primary takeaway is that glorifying violence only brings about more violence. In earlier movies, Gale gained fame by publishing books about the murders; here she decides to keep the story to herself and \"let it die\" on its own, without inspiring any more copycats.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sydney Prescott is a pretty decent role model for a horror hero: She's more than the traditional \"final girl\"; she's a true survivor, tough with sharp instincts. But she hasn't closed herself off, either; she still has room in her heart for her kids and friends. She does rely a little too heavily on firearms. Gale has overcome her earlier backstabbing ways to become an admirable, powerful person.\n|Diverse Representations|: The two new main characters are played by actors with Latino backgrounds (Mexican and Puerto Rican), and main group of friends includes Black siblings.

It includes animated action violence and potentially scary images of enormous sea monsters attacking ships and causing destruction. Monster hunters attack and kill the giant creatures with a variety of weapons (spears, cannons, etc.). Chaos and fighting lead to a child getting seriously injured, and a little blood is briefly shown. There are swashbuckling sword fights and close calls with drowning, an adult points a gun at a child, and a child wields a knife. Adult characters drink, and language includes \"bloody hell\" and \"ass.\" The story shows the power of young people's standing up for others and making a big difference, as well as teamwork, integrity, and looking past the surface of a situation. And the film boasts a diverse cast, including a young, strong female character who's kind, optimistic, and brave.\n|Educational Value|: There's often more to things/situations than what meets the eye.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes optimism, bravery, integrity, perseverance, teamwork, and looking past the superficial. Encourages people to challenge long-standing beliefs that might be wrong; just because something has always been a certain way doesn't mean it can't (or shouldn't) change.\n|Positive Role Models|: Maisie is a brave child who's willing to stand up for what's right and challenge anyone who stands in the way of that. She has integrity and helps those around her learn to think differently and, even as the youngest main character, is a strong leader. Jacob tries to do what he thinks is right; he's used to a certain way of doing things but is willing to learn and to listen to other/better ideas. He helps others in need and practices loyalty. Captain Crow is determined and courageous but also very set in his ways.\n|Diverse Representations|: Maisie, a lead character, is a young Black girl. She has a powerful voice that she uses to educate and inspire adults. First mate on monster-hunting ship is also a Black female; she has agency and is respected. Ship's crew includes several diverse characters of all shapes, sizes, and colors; some have prosthetic limbs. Women are seen as equal leaders.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The hunters are attacked by various sea monsters, some scary looking and causing lots of destruction with sharp teeth, long tentacles, and pincers. The monsters attempt to swallow and/or harm humans. Hunters attack, injure, kill monsters with spears, cannons, poison. Chaos and fighting leads to a child getting seriously injured. A little blood is briefly shown. Sword fights. A character points a gun at a child. Several close calls with drowning.

It's cleverly constructed and emotionally satisfying, as well as diverse and culturally relevant. Expect brief on-screen fighting, arguing, and yelling, as well as offscreen and verbal references to violence. A main character dies of cancer. There's a bit of sex-related dialogue and some sexual references, and there's a brief, wrongful theory that an uncle is having some kind of sexual relationship with his teen niece. Language includes one \"f---ing\" and uses of \"perv.\" A secondary character appears to be a drug dealer, supplying pot (offscreen) to a teen girl. A jar filled with pot is shown, teen drug use is inferred, and there's pipe smoking. Many tech brand names are shown throughout (Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), but all in service to the story. Underlying everything are messages of perseverance and the need for stronger communication among family members, as well as the notion of the internet as both a useful and a dangerous place.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is all about solving problems, as well as persistence/perseverance in the face of great stress and very little hope. Generosity is a virtue, and better communication between family members is encouraged. Simple \"protection\" of family members, no matter what they've done wrong, is discouraged.\n|Positive Role Models|: David Kim is a sympathetic character, a problem solver, a good parent who goes to great lengths to rescue his daughter. He's also a positive, three-dimensional Asian American character. Without giving too much away, Margot performs an act of incredible generosity; it doesn't turn out well for her, but her act is nonetheless seen as admirable.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A main character dies of cancer. A teen girl goes missing. A car is found in a lake (there's the possibility of a body inside). A man punches a teen boy. Bloody/bruised face. Spoken reference to a jaw being broken.

It aims to show the value of \"street smarts vs. book smarts,\" as well as the value of female friendship. While it would seem like the moral of the story should be \"don't lie,\" all of Maya's dreams do eventually come true as a result of the fibs, which could imply to kids that lying is a winning strategy. Maya's best friend's non-stop potty mouth -- which is copied by her young son -- is played for humor, so there's lots of swearing (including \"s--t,\" one use of \"f--k,\" and more), but the language eventually has consequences. The friend also makes sexual jokes, and Maya and her long-term boyfriend flirt and shower together (bare shoulders and a man's chest are shown). Characters kiss, sex is implied, there's cleavage on display, and characters discuss the concept of sexual fetishes. Many real brands are on display, both visually and verbally, particularly high-end skincare products. The movie has a significant adoption storyline about finding a birth mother; it doesn't portray an instant connection, but rather one that flourishes into a near-BFF relationship.\n|Positive Messages|: The primary theme is that everyone deserves a second chance -- both offering that opportunity to others and allowing it for yourself, too, whether that's trying to achieve a dream or forgiving yourself for a mistake. The film revolves around an inflated resume, so there's also the message that a relationship can't survive a lie (although, you know, second chances). A recurring quip is \"the only thing stopping you is you.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Women are shown to help empower one another in the workforce; but at the same time, female coworkers are also are shown to be conniving. One character demonstrates courage in making a tough, unselfish decision. The film features a strong female cast, female producers and a female screenwriter; two female characters of Hispanic heritage are top executives at a large company.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A flock of birds accidentally and comically dies (their own doing). Friends slap each other in a \"wake up\" manner. A man says he'd like to beat a corporate rival with a chair.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple considering marriage lives together and is shown showering together; shoulders and a faint body outline are seen. Flirtatious, sexual banter; discussion of sexual fetishes in general terms. Frequent sex jokes/innuendo. Several low-cut/revealing outfits (lots of cleavage). Characters kiss, with a sexual relationship implied, but no sex is seen. Their relationship is a part of the story, but not the film's primary focus.\n|Language|: Frequent swearing, and the plot involves a storyline in which characters must curb their use of profanity. Words include: one use of \"f--k,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"balls,\" \"boob,\" \"bitch,\" d--k,\" \"frickin',\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"p---ies\" (used like \"wuss\"), \"s--t,\" \"slutty,\" and \"for Christ's sake\" and \"oh my God\" as exclamations.\n|Products & Purchases|: Full Moon Pizza in the Bronx.

Other brands/logos in the background in the context of the story, such as CoffeeMate, Cafe Bustelo, and Dunkin' Donuts. Characters bond at a Dean and Deluca coffee shop.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink wine and beer at parties, clubs, and when friends get together to chat.

In the movie's case, it involves quite a bit of danger and peril -- which isn't what was showcased in the movie's promotional campaign. Main characters Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet) are frequently chased, sometimes on foot and sometimes in cars/vans/buses, which bang into things, crash, and catch on fire. They also dodge Animal Control officers; navigate dank, gloomy sewers; face off against an enormous viper and other predators/angry animals; and confront each other via barking, growling, yelling, and more. Animals discuss killing people (one anti-human animal character is impressed when others claim to have offed their former owners and detail how they did it). At one point it looks like a main character may not survive, and one bad guy dies in an altercation. There's some bodily function humor (a Chihuahua pees on the floor in excitement, dogs sniff each other's rear ends, etc.), a fair bit of insult language (\"dumb,\" \"stupid,\" \"weirdo,\" \"idiots,\" \"cry baby,\" etc.), and one use of swear stand-in \"holy schnitzel.\" But underlying all this are positive messages about friendship, teamwork, perseverance, and empathy -- as well as the futility of revenge and the importance of being open to new friends and the experiences that life brings. Max and Duke's relationship could particularly resonate with blended families and/or those dealing with sibling issues.\n|Educational Value|: In addition to social-emotional lessons regarding teamwork and empathy, kids may pick up a little bit about animal behavior/habits and New York City.\n|Positive Messages|: While there's a lot of anger/revenge going on, the messages about perseverance, teamwork, and empathy are ultimately positive (if not as clearly stated as in some kids' movies). To wit: never stop trying, and you can get a lot more done with the right team than you can by yourself. Be open to new friends and the experiences that life brings -- change can be hard but also rewarding (especially when it comes to new \"siblings\"). Loyalty and friendship are key to success. Think about others' feelings.\n|Positive Role Models|: Max initially fears and dislikes Duke; he doesn't want to share Katie (or anything else) with his new \"brother.\" But over the course of the movie, he comes to value Duke and learns that he can live with change. Duke starts out impulsive and pushy but also grows and changes to become more helpful and less defensive. Snowball is very angry; he hates humans because he was abandoned and dreams of revenge -- but he also steps up when circumstances demand. Gidget is loyal, determined, and fearless; she refuses to give up on Max, no matter what stands in her way. Tiberius manages to control his impulses to help his new friend.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent danger and peril. Chase scenes on foot and in vehicles (driven erratically and dangerously by animals); cars/buses crash into other vehicles, buildings, bridges, and more (sometimes catching on fire), and characters are pursued through dank, gloomy sewers. At one point it looks like a main character may not survive. Some scary/intimidating animals, including mangy alley cats, a huge viper, an alligator, a hungry hawk, and other predators; one unsympathetic character dies in an altercation. Human Animal Control officers go after several characters on multiple occasions and sometimes succeed in grabbing them and locking them up in cages. Some animal characters want all humans to die; a couple lie and say they've killed their owners (and go into detail about how the supposedly did it). Animals yell/growl/hiss/bark/yowl at and threaten each other and wreak havoc in human living spaces (messes, broken decor, etc.). Pratfalls and physical humor.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Gidget watches a telenovela-like TV show with some embraces between passionate characters. She also has a huge crush on Max and at one point pounces on and licks him.\n|Language|: Insults/rude language includes \"dumb,\" \"dummies,\" \"stupid\" (several times), \"weirdo,\" \"shut it,\" \"suckers,\" \"idiots,\" \"ugly,\" \"crazy,\" \"poo poo,\" \"caca,\" \"cry baby,\" \"big fat brown dog,\" \"bad dog,\" \"got a screw loose,\" and \"freak.\" Also one use of the swear stand-in \"holy schnitzel.\" Lyrics for soundtrack songs include the word \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: YouTube logo is shown when a cat video goes viral. Associated product tie-ins outside the movie -- toys, books, games, apparel, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Max and Duke almost seem to get high on sausages during their interlude in the meat factory -- they share a hallucination-like vision of a magic land full of singing, dancing meat products.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c67594b2b001e6f2f79": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-secret-life-of-pets-2", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Secret Life of Pets 2 is the sequel to the 2016 animated comedy about what pets do when their humans aren't home. It continues the story of Max (now voiced by Patton Oswalt) as his owner gets married and has a baby. A subplot has Snowball (Kevin Hart) and new dog Daisy (Tiffany Haddish) working together to rescue an abused tiger from a Russian circus that has menacing wolves and a cartoonishly villainous lion tamer. The dark humor and peril are toned down from the original, with more of a shift to slapstick violence that's meant to be funny. Animals punch and throw knives at one another, and a bad guy is hit by a car, but no one is ever really injured. Language includes \"pissed,\" put-downs (\"jerk,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" etc.), and potty humor (\"turd\"). And there's a scene in which a cat is high on catnip. Messages for parents revolve around Max's anxiety about keeping his owner's toddler safe; his helicopter ways are questioned by a dog named Rooster (Harrison Ford), who's more of a let-them-get-hurt-and-learn kind of canine. For kids, though, the main moral of the story is to face and embrace the changes life inevitably brings.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Life is constantly changing; you can either run away from it or run at it. Teamwork is a clear theme; the animals have to work together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Two female dogs are brave and confident; Gidget goes the extra mile to keep her commitment, and Daisy acts with compassion to save a mistreated animal. A male dog, Max, acts maternally to a human baby. Snowball and Daisy work together to help a tiger.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick animated comedy, such as cats punching each other for a toy. Two animals throw knives at each other. It's implied that a circus animal is being mistreated (he cowers; the villain cracks a whip near him). Menacing wolves chase characters, snapping their jaws. Characters are in peril. A fox attacks a dog, is then attacked by another dog. A bad guy is hit by a car. Animal shot out of a cannon. Dog bites a pig's tail; it reacts in pain. In all instances, no one is really injured. Animal is shot with a dart gun; it goes to sleep. Dog in a rural area hears sounds of nature, is scared.

As in the original Brothers Grimm tale, orphaned siblings Hansel (voiced by Nicholas Corda and Alyson Leigh Rosenfeld) and Gretel (Courtney Shaw) -- in this case, adults transformed temporarily into kids -- are taken in by an old witch in the forest who plans to put them to sleep and eat them. She gives them drugged cookies and sharpens a knife in preparation. That's just one scene, and the siblings have resources to escape thanks to Gretel's secret agent training and magical devices like a flying machine. But the two are also threatened by a variety of humans, animals, magical creatures, and animated objects. There are explosions and fires, slaps and punches, ovens and vats, falls and crash landings, electrocution, freeze guns, magical potions, and more. The siblings manage to not only escape unscathed, but also save the kingdom and be given special status by the king, learning in the process how much they love and must rely on each other. Childish taunts include \"hustler,\" \"cheat,\" \"charlatan,\" \"con artist,\" \"thief,\" \"brat,\" \"jerk,\" and \"liar.\" There's some potty humor, and a buxom female in a tight dress and red lipstick tricks the king into marrying her. She and the king kiss a couple of times.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can connect the classic fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel with the characters and aspects of the film's plot.\n|Positive Messages|: Family, especially orphaned siblings, must stick together and support each other no matter what. Teamwork gets the job done. Good deeds are rewarded, while bad deeds and trickery aren't.\n|Positive Role Models|: Gretel has worked hard to be a straight-A student and rise as one of the kingdom's top secret agents. She models discipline and dedication and believes she has achieved her dreams all on her own by being completely self sufficient. When she learns she's had help she didn't know about, she's apologetic for being presumptuous and ungrateful. Hansel works as a charlatan and magician, selling people false amulets and other goods, but he has a kind heart and helps others in need. He consistently puts his sister and the greater good above his own interests. A female character is an inventions whiz. Baba Yaga and Ilvira behave selfishly and are willing to hurt others to get what they want. Diverse characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cartoon violence that includes explosions and fires, slaps and punches, falls and crash landings, electrocution, freeze guns, and animated food and animals attacking human characters. Hansel and Gretel are transformed into kids and threatened repeatedly, given cookies laced with a sleeping agent, dropped into a candy oven and a sticky vat of cookie dough, caught in a collapsed home, and nearly turned into fish. They barely escape most situations, and they do so using weapons like a potion shooter, an uncontrollable flying machine, and explosive devices. Human characters fall on their heads and black out, get launched into space, and are kidnapped or held hostage.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Hansel is dazed by the attractive mermaids in a paradise realm and makes plans to wow the \"single ladies\" of the kingdom. Ilvira is a buxom female in a tight dress and red lipstick who is using magical cookies to bewitch the kingdom and trick the king into marrying her. She and the king kiss a couple of times.\n|Language|: Childish taunts include \"hustler,\" \"cheat,\" \"charlatan,\" \"con artist,\" \"thief,\" \"brat,\" \"jerk,\" and \"liar.\" A French-sounding chef yells \"Mon Dieu!\" Some potty humor.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of magical potions that can transform people and animals and can also animate objects, including food items, or put any of these to sleep, bewitch them, and make them behave in different ways.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e16227378ba8e003fd446ce": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/secret-obsession", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Secret Obsession is an intense thriller in which a female protagonist is in dire jeopardy throughout.

Brutal killings occur in murky, disorienting shots; dead bodies are seen, bloody and/or decomposing.

There's not much to worry parents -- even those with preschoolers -- but a few tense scenes might make little kids a bit sad at the thought of Tink or her sister Peri not being able to fly. In one sequence, it seems like a weather-related disaster will demolish Pixie Hollow. A fairy couple kisses and another fairy overtly flirts with a brawny male fairy.

As a group of teenage \"second-born royals\" discover their secret superpowers and are trained to use them, the teens are put into perilous situations: They're shot at with lasers, thrown to the ground, hit by falling objects, and more. A dangerous criminal with the ability to move objects with his mind escapes prison and launches a deadly plot to kill the world's royalty. It will be up to the second-borns to save the royal families, even if that means eliminating the criminal. The teens learn about teamwork, friendship, and the value of traditions -- and also about betrayal and people who are willing to kill for their own purposes. There are some positive messages here that could hit home with younger viewers, including teen characters needing to master their own insecurities and learning to care about other people and spend less time online. The main character rebels against her own royal family, shouting \"Down with the monarchy!\" in public and sneaking into a club even though she's underage. There's mild flirting between the teen characters, and language is limited to \"sucks\" and \"jerk.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Everyone needs friends. Teenagers don't always know what's best for them when they rebel against society, traditions, or their elders. Individuals can be more effective when they work together. Change, even at state level, can come about peacefully.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sam's mom and sister are patient with her even though she critiques all that they stand for. Sam's sister says she took on extra responsibility so Sam could have a normal childhood after their dad died. Her mother has kept certain aspects of her father's death hidden. Sam rebels against her own royal family, shouting \"Down with the monarchy!\" in public, sneaks into a club though she's underage. Teens at summer school long to feel accepted by true friends. They each have something to learn about overcoming insecurities, caring for others, living real life more than virtual life.

Some children will understand that this is intended as macabre humor but others will not, so parents should be particularly cautious about deciding whether the film is appropriate for their kids. Other parental concerns include some very crude language \"said\" by a baby (\"shmuck,\" \"bite me\"), and a forced marriage with a 14-year-old (predatory, but only with regard to her money).\n|Positive Role Models|: Brave and intelligent children of both genders.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Peril, tension, and violence (mostly off-screen), some graphic images.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A forced marriage with a 14-year-old (predatory, but only with regard to her money).\n|Language|: Some very crude language \"said\" by a baby (\"shmuck,\" \"bite me\").\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683f54c0f0001f304ad6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/seven-brides-for-seven-brothers", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that some critics have complained that this movie all but promotes rape, but that's unfair.

There's a surprising single use of \"f--k\" (used in exasperation), and there's more immediate passionate kissing and romance than in comparable YA fantasy adaptations. In one scene it's even implied that a teen couple has had sex, based on their position on a bed and the way the girl's top is loose and off her shoulder. The violence is on par with other fantasy series, but it's still disturbing when people are burned to ash, swallowed (the evil witches turn into animal familiars, like dragons and leopards), or killed with swords and other medieval weapons.\n|Positive Messages|: Thomas' mother urges him to clear his heart of grief and fill it with courage. The storyline encourages people to question immoral rules and stand up for what they believe.\n|Positive Role Models|: Thomas' mother puts herself at risk to strengthen and protect him. She sacrifices her safety to defend her town. Thomas and Alice believe they can be more peaceful than their hate-filled elders. On the iffier side, a witch's minions are played exclusively by minority actors.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many characters die, some in horrifying ways. Master Gregory kills witches by burning them. The Witch Queen and her cronies turn into their animal familiars and destroy a town, killing many innocent citizens; although there's no blood, residents are burned, crushed, and, in one case, swallowed/eaten. Some confrontations are hand to hand, with weapons like swords, knives, chains, and staffs. Some of the witches fight as their familiars -- dragons, bears, leopards, etc. -- which adds to the violence as they bite, roar, and jump on people.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Thomas and Alice flirt from the first time they meet; they kiss passionately several times and eventually make out; the scene then fades into a shot of them lying next to one another, drowsy and embracing.

The son of The Mandarin (Tony Leung) -- the superhumanly powerful leader of the underground criminal organization the Ten Rings -- Shang-Chi was trained as an assassin from an early age. As a teen, he abandoned his destiny in order to live a normal life, but his father sends muscle to force him back home a decade later. As in all of the MCU movies, families can expect lots of sometimes-intense comic book-style violence. Most of it is martial arts-based and involves heavy hand-to-hand combat, although characters also occasionally use guns, bows, spears, and other weapons (and, naturally, things blow up). There's a fairly large body count, frightening demon-like creatures, and a couple of deaths that may hit viewers hard. Language is infrequent but includes \"s--t\" and \"damn.\" There's less romance in this movie than in other MCU entries, with the exception of flashbacks to how two characters met and fell in love (there are a couple of embraces and kisses). The film is notable for featuring a nearly all-Asian cast (including popular comedic actor Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend), as well as for its messages of teamwork, perseverance, and courage.\n|Positive Messages|: Courage, heroism, protecting those you love, belonging to a community, acting for the greater good. Themes include teamwork, perseverance, courage. Shows how important family and friendship are, how the concept of family is more than blood: People can have incredibly strong chosen families, with friends who love you unconditionally. Emphasizes idea of knowing and being who you are, not who you think you're destined or supposed to be to please others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Shaun/Shang-Chi is brave, empathetic, kind. He's protective of his loved ones, particularly his friend and sister, also of his mother's community. Katy is a loyal friend who's like a sister to Shaun; she commits to helping him even when she could easily stay safe back at home. Xialing is bold, brave, independent. Central characters put themselves in harm's way to save a community.\n|Diverse Representations|: Nearly all-Asian/Asian diaspora cast, with exception of a couple of supporting players. Focuses on racial/ethnic representation, as well as non-stereotypical depictions in the form of Shaun and Katy, who aren't in predictable career paths.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent, intense comic book-style action violence. It isn't especially gory, but there are a couple of injuries/deaths, plus frequent peril and danger. Characters are killed and severely injured. Viewers see people plummeting to their death; being stabbed, crushed, shot, or impaled; pursued by scary, demon-like monsters, etc. Explosions/destruction. Lots of hand-to-hand combat.

The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex. Guards beat and kill an inmate. A prisoner is shot and killed by a man with a rifle. There is also a scene in which a character crawls through 500 yards of a sewer pipe filled with excrement. There is also frequent profanity, including \"f--k\" and its variations. However, the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions and a sense of maintaining perseverance and hope in the darkest of hours.\n|Positive Messages|: Hope, endurance, and unconditional friendship are core themes of the film. Corruption, manipulation, and betrayal are also present, but they're shown to fail in the end. The problem of \"institutionalization\" is shown and discussed -- a prison inmate has spent so much time in prison, he has forgotten how to live outside the prison walls. Integrity and perseverance are major themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Andy never gives up hope. Red is loyal and practical. All the characters are flawed, but it's clear who the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys are, even though their positions might not suggest that from the start. Inmates work together, often illegally, to make life more bearable. The warden is corrupt and takes bribes, but it's shown in a negative light.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A man commits suicide by hanging. A man is shot and killed by another man with a rifle. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references to oral and anal sex and the takeaway that one of the lead characters was raped repeatedly by other prisoners.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sex is portrayed obliquely at the beginning. Lots of cheesecake photos of sex symbols from the 1950s and '60s decorate the prison walls.\n|Language|: Frequent profanity, including \"f--k.\" Jokes about rape. \"Maggot d--k motherf---er.\" \"Queer\" is used pejoratively. \"A--hole.\" \"Son of a bitch.\" \"Piss.\" \"Horses--t.\" \"Prick.\" \"Fatass.\" \"Ass.\" A euphemism for defecation.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A man is shown sitting in his car drinking whiskey from a flask before stumbling out to, presumably, murder his wife and her lover.

Kids are also bullied. Language isn't constant, but characters do say \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"oh my God,\" and more. And you can expect a little innuendo/suggestive humor, especially in scenes where characters go into a strip club. More serious themes include abandonment, disability, and more. But there are positive messages about the importance of family (the movie's example of a loving, caring foster home is refreshing), generosity, courage, teamwork, and standing up for others.\n|Positive Messages|: Several positive messages for kids. Shows importance of having strong foundation in family, whether it's a biological one or a foster one (movie's example of loving, caring foster home is nice change from many representations). Main character might not have a lot of money, but he's rich in unconditional love and support from foster family. Meanwhile, main antagonist's wealthy family never supported him. Clear themes of teamwork, courage, gratitude, responsibility to the greater good, redemption, and selflessness vs. selfishness.\n|Positive Role Models|: Billy/Shazam's story is one of redemption, maturity. He learns to not just focus on himself but also think about others. He's finally able to accept love, give it in return. Freddy provides positive representation of teen with physical disability. The Vazquezes are kind foster parents who love and support their foster kids, expect them to respect and value one another.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense car crash near beginning includes character being thrown from the vehicle; some blood. Lots of superhero violence (much with slapstick tone, but some quite scary). Villain unleashes the potentially upsetting \"Seven Deadly Sins\" monsters out of his eye in a boardroom; they kill people in variety of ways. Some characters crumble and disintegrate disturbingly (one screams in terror as it happens); others are shot with guns, slammed against buildings, walls, concrete, etc. A character is thrown out of a window; another's head is bitten off. Lots of chases and pursuits, with big fights between Sivana and Shazam and later a climactic battle with more characters. Property damage. School bullies push Freddy to the ground; Billy punches them. Parents yell at, disparage children. A child loses his mother in a crowd, leading to permanent separation.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Shazam and Freddy go into a strip club twice, once by themselves briefly and once with the entire sibling gang (the oldest sister is shown covering the eyes of the youngest sister, but the boys look pleased and dazed). The scenes are comedic in tone. In one case, Freddy asks Shazam whether he saw any boobs. Some innuendo (e.g., Wizard: \"Lay your hands on my staff.\" Billy: \"Gross!\").\n|Language|: Language isn't constant but includes \"ass,\" \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"sucks balls,\" \"douche bags,\" \"butt,\" \"nuts,\" \"you suck,\" \"moron,\" \"pee,\" \"oh my God\" and \"Jesus Christ\" (as exclamations).

The movie is intended to be a modernized version of the Shakespeare play Twelfth Night, and, as such, Bynes' character's gender switch leads to frequent misunderstandings and deceptions leading to further deceptions. The humor is frequently derived from sex. When dressed as her brother and showing up at her dorm for the first time, her/his roommates find her tampons, she claims it's for bloody noses; later a character stops up a bloody nose with one of her tampons. Characters are forced to prove they are who they say they are by exposing their naked body parts (not shown); when Viola's actual brother drops his pants, their father conveys pride in the size of his penis.

Gritty, late-1800s London is the movie's backdrop, and there's no shortage of action -- from brutal, slo-mo fistfight scenes (most with blood and broken bones) to gunplay and big explosions. There are also some fairly gory crime scenes (including shots of dead bodies, one with a few wriggling maggots), a brief scene of a naked (aside from a strategically placed pillow) Holmes handcuffed to a bed, references to the dark rituals of occult secret societies, smoking, and drinking. But there's no swearing to speak of, and the movie ultimately celebrates Holmes and Watson's close friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: There are some power-hungry, murderous villains on the loose in London, and the city itself is presented as a fairly brutal, gritty environment. But the film also celebrates Holmes' eccentric genius and his close friendship with Watson. Though he's a cantankerous soul, Holmes clearly values his friend and even tries to save a former paramour despite the fact that she once double-crossed him.\n|Positive Role Models|: They trade barbs and are feisty with each other, but Holmes and Watson always fight for the good -- and for each other. That said, they're so intent on capturing villains that they sometimes sacrifice their personal lives.

Though the fight scenes are very choreographed and stylized, they're bone-crunching and often brutal.

There's also a fair bit of innuendo, one scene of a naked man from behind, some mild language (\"bastard\" and \"damn), pipe smoking, and social drinking. Holmes (again played by Robert Downey Jr.) dons women's clothing in one sequence.\n|Positive Messages|: There's lots of iffy stuff going on here, but Holmes and Watson's friendship is a powerful example of loyalty. Also, Holmes continues to remind audiences to pay attention to even the smallest of details because the answers to our questions, big and small, lie in them.\n|Positive Role Models|: Holmes' sharp mind continues to be admirable, his eccentricities notwithstanding. And Watson remains straightforward and forthright. The friends always fight for good, even if their methods are sometimes iffy. Watson's wife, Mary, has a bigger role in this film, proving herself equal to the task of crime-fighting.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The film is filled with highly choreographed fights and lots of other action violence.

The violence is generally humorous and fantasy based; most is directly related to characters' wishes (people transforming into animals, the above-mentioned booger becoming a giant menace, etc.). On a more serious note, the movie has several thought-provoking messages about bullying, family relationships, and technology.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will definitely remember the message of being careful what you wish for. They'll also pick up on the lessons about how a bully could end up actually being your friend, how greed is bad, and that \"green is the new black.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork and overcoming obstacles (usually in the form of the Black family) are key messages, as is the basic idea that you have to be careful what you wish for -- because you never know if you just might get it. There's also a strong message about family life. Many sibling and parent-child relationships are strengthened over the course of the adventure. Toby makes new friends and rediscovers old ones who all work together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Toby works tirelessly to keep the rocks from falling into the wrong hands. He convinces others to do the same, even when it's against their self interest. Helvetica, although a somewhat negative role model, is a strong female character, and she ultimately redeems herself. Loogie's brothers are the voice of reason, trying to explain to Loogie that he should be wishing for world peace or the end of starvation instead of fortresses and candy bars. Toby's parents are also good role models, prioritizing their marriage and family above career goals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish and fantastical violence includes a booger turning into a giant monster that chases a group of scared people; a person becoming a weaponized, Transformers-like being that wreaks havoc on a town; a kid's \"wish\" of rattlesnakes and crocodiles coming true (and then attacking him and his brothers); and the like. More realistic incidents include Helvetica's ongoing bullying of Toby, which usually consists of a daily trip, headfirst, into the nearest trash can; kids falling out of a tree; and kids falling out of a window and breaking both arms.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Toby jokes that Helvetica picks on him because she actually likes him; they have a middle-school love/hate relationship. Toby's parents lament their loss of intimacy, and, after a rock literally binds them at the hip, they nearly kiss and eventually fix their relationship. Loogie misguidedly flirts with Toby's older sister, who's in a fight with her boyfriend (they eventually make up with a hug).\n|Language|: Fairly frequent use of colorful insults like \"lunkhead,\" \"hillbilly teeth,\" \"Dr. Dumb Butt,\" as well as more traditional ones like \"you suck,\" \"freak,\" and \"loser.\" Kids' nicknames can be mean-spirited, such as \"Toe\" for Toby, \"Hell\" for Helvetica, and \"Nose\" for a boy who eats his boogers.\n|Products & Purchases|: The candy bar Nutrageous is shown many times as part of a running joke (a boy wishes he had an endless supply), and Skittles and IKEA are both mentioned.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Glimpses of adults drinking wine/champagne at a fancy costume party in one scene.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682861141d001fb136c8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/shrek", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Shrek includes some edgy humor directed at teens and adults. The jokes that teens and adults snicker at (like when Shrek wonders whether the small Lord Farquaad is compensating for something with his very tall castle) will be over the head of most younger kids, but parents should be ready for some questions. There's also plenty of potty humor and gross-out jokes directed at kids \u2013 mostly based on the appalling personal habits of ogres. Scary scenes for young ones include fights with guards, villagers coming after Shrek with pitchforks, and a fire-breathing dragon (who turns nice when she falls for Donkey). A bird explodes, and its eggs are eaten, and a character is eaten in one gulp by the dragon, but it's not graphic.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Staying true to yourself, looking beyond appearances, and the power of friendship are big themes. (But there's also a fair bit of bodily function humor.)\n|Positive Role Models|: Princess Fiona is a strong character who challenges the prim 'n' proper princess stereotype. Shrek seems cantankerous and rude, but he has a tender heart and is ultimately trustworthy, loyal, and brave. Donkey is a dedicated friend. Many characters demonstrate the qualities of curiosity, integrity, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Characters in peril; ogre hunters wave pitchforks and torches; a bird explodes; scary fire-breathing dragon (who is much less scary when she gets a crush on Donkey); one character is eaten in one gulp by the dragon.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild sexual humor. Some innuendo that will go over kids' head (for example, when Shrek sees the big tower that is Farquaad's castle and says to Donkey, \"Gee, think he's compensating for something?\").\n|Language|: Strong language for a kids' movie, including \"damn,\" \"ass,\" and \"crap.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of tie-in products available in real life.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776828e6d55c002040b27f": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/shrek-2", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Shrek 2 has some crude potty humor and some moments of mild peril and tension.

Shrek and Fiona, as well as Donkey and his dragon wife, are all affectionate and flirt and kiss and declare their eternal love to each other. The gross-out humor is limited to some disgusting items the ogres eat and a few jokes about Donkey and the ogres, but otherwise, this is an animated movie for general audiences. Be warned, though, Shrek has a lot of merchandising tie-ins, so the consumerism is difficult to escape. Also, since it's offered in 3-D, a few scenes are more intense than they'd be otherwise.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn the importance of banding together to fight injustice, just as the ogres do.\n|Positive Messages|: The messages include being grateful for what you have (including family and friends), even when it's difficult. Also, having integrity and standing up for freedom and the rights of the disenfranchised. And don't make important decisions when stressed out (or after drinking!). Some fat jokes at the expense of Puss.\n|Positive Role Models|: Fiona is a great example of a take-charge fighter of injustice. She believes in defying the tyrannical rule of Rumpelstiltskin, inspires her fellow ogres to overthrow their evil dictator.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence includes Gingy fighting animal crackers gladiator-style; the ogres taking up arms to fight the witches who are around Rumpelstiltskin.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Fiona and Shrek kiss, flirt, and proclaim their true love for each other. Donkey and his Dragon-wife also make kissy faces at each other. Rumpelstiltskin surrounds himself with a cabal of witches, many of whom seem to adore him.\n|Language|: Some mild insults like \"stupid\" and \"fat,\" as well as \"ass\" used appropriately to describe Donkey.\n|Products & Purchases|: As in past installments, real brands are referenced and changed for use in Far Far Away. The real issue with consumerism, however, is all the merchandise tie-ins that target kids: McDonalds, Gogurt, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Shrek has five or six \"Eyeball-tinis\" in martini glasses mixed by Rumpelstiltskin, who also offers him \"Mudslides.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768273c3c2a001fbcb521": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/shrek-the-third", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Shrek the Third is the third movie in the Shrek franchise. There are several references to alcohol and drugs that are clearly meant to entertain parents and likely will go over kids' head. Real brands such as Foot Locker, Versace, and Hooters are parodied for humor. Profanity and insults include \"butt,\" \"dork,\" \"loser,\" \"poop,\" \"stupid,\" \"twit,\" and \"suck.\" There's quite a bit of innuendo: Puss starts to explain where children come from (a man is \"full of urges\" for his wife) but is cut off; Doris says Charming makes her \"hotter than July.\" The villains and heroes of fairy tale lore engage in face-to-face battles with sticks, swords, fists, and more. Some bullying -- one of the main teen characters is shown hanging from a clock in the auditorium of the high school; characters openly discuss \"wedgies\" and \"swirlies.\" There's also frequent slapstick violence -- pratfalls and clumsiness leading to exaggerated destruction.\n|Positive Messages|: The princesses are selfish and a bit stereotypical at first but eventually prove to be good role models since they defend themselves rather than waiting to be rescued. Fairy tale villains choose to be good. Typical high school relationships (popular kids picking on those who don't fit in, for example) are played for laughs. The importance of integrity and choosing to be yourself no matter what others think of you is shown through discussion and action.\n|Positive Role Models|: Shrek is a kind-hearted ogre who loves his wife and wants to do what's best for the land of Far Far Away. Although shown early in the film to be a frequent target of bullies, Artie learns to stand up for himself and to understand the responsibilities required to rule a kingdom. The women in the movie act somewhat helpless early on, but they learn to stand up for themselves and to use their skills to escape being held prisoner.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The villains and heroes of fairy tale lore engage in face-to-face battles with sticks, swords, fists, and more. Some bullying -- one of the main teen characters is shown hanging from a clock in the auditorium of the high school; characters openly discuss \"wedgies\" and \"swirlies.\" Frequent slapstick violence -- pratfalls and clumsiness leading to exaggerated destruction.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Shrek and Fiona are affectionate and kiss; they're shown sleeping in the same bed (it's implied that Shrek is naked, but you don't see anything). Two other couples hug, and Puss flirts with various female cats. Puss starts to explain where children come from (a man is \"full of urges\" for his wife) but is cut off; Doris says Charming makes her \"hotter than July.\" Merlin wears an ill-fitting robe; a character says it \"doesn't quite cover his...\" but is interrupted before the final word is said.\n|Language|: PG words and insults: \"butt,\" \"dork,\" \"loser,\" \"poop,\" \"stupid,\" \"twit.\" A well-timed Viking horn bleeps out the final word when a character tells another that he is \"royally [bleeped].\" A sign taped to a character's backside reads \"I sucketh.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Real brands are parodied for humor. Versace logo is shown as \"Versarchery,\" men flock to \"Ye Olde Hooters,\" and a box has the label \"Ye Olde Foot Locker.\"  Shrek also is the spokes-ogre for a wide variety of real-life products, including candy and fast food -- while simultaneously appearing in anti-obesity ads for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Fuzzy navels are ordered at a bar where characters drink out of steins and glasses. Puss proposes that he and Shrek drink mojitos. Students at Artie's high school tumble out of a smoke-filled carriage talking about frankincense and myrrh in an obvious pot reference.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e1625bd9ff55d003e76d454": {"verified": false, "updated": "2022-07-28"}, "plex://movie/5d7768365af944001f1fa488": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/shutter-island", "cs_age": 18, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 18+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Shutter Island is a very intense thriller, with some highly disturbing imagery, including drowned children, Nazi concentration camps, piles of corpses, blood, guns, dark prison corridors, and bizarre, scary nightmares and hallucinations. It contains strong, but not pervasive, foul language, smoking, and suggestions of various medical/experimental drugs. The movie's surprises and twists, while somewhat transparent, might appeal to older teens, if they can stomach the strong stuff. Younger kids and teens are strongly warned away.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie deals with the limits of the human mind and the sheer amount of horror and torment it can take before it snaps. It also examines the extent to which humans are capable of violence and evil. Some characters may or may not have good intentions, but the movie deliberately blurs this behavior in the service of the story. Some conversation about belief in God.\n|Positive Role Models|: The hero is not much of a role model. He has twin goals: One of them requires bravery and selflessness and the other, selfish revenge. But whether he achieves either of these goals is up for debate. He also exhibits violent and erratic behavior throughout and does not play well with others. (On the other hand, he does risk his life in one sequence to save his partner.) Other characters do not seem trustworthy or reliable either.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Quite a few disturbing flashbacks and nightmare sequences, with piles of dead bodies in the Dachau concentration camp, a failed suicide attempt (the victim lays twitching in a puddle of blood), drowned children, a woman's body burning, shooting victims, and more blood. One scene shows the mass slaughter of Nazi guards by American soldiers; their bodies are riddled with bullets as they collapse, one by one, in a line. There are also scary images, such as prisoners grabbing through prison bars at the hero.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No sex, but in a flashback sequence we see a little kissing between an affectionate married couple. Brief flash of unclothed male prisonors.\n|Language|: The words \"f--k\" is heard about a dozen times; \"s--t\" a few times. We also hear \"dick,\" \"prick,\" \"cock,\" \"screw that,\" \"dammit,\" \"Jesus Christ,\" and \"Goddamn it.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters smoke cigarettes often, and one character smokes a pipe. The main character once had a drinking problem, but now abstains from liquor. We see him drinking whisky in flashbacks. Other characters drink in a social way. The hospital uses various sedatives and other kinds of drugs on the patients. The hero takes aspirins and there is a suggestion that they might be laced with hallucinogens or other drugs. We see the effects of these drugs through the eyes of the hero.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768adebdf2200209c5d47": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/silence", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Silence is a religious epic set in the 17th century from Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese. Anyone who loved his earlier films The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun (or pretty much any of his movies) will want to see this. It's complex, difficult, and at times unwieldy and gory, but it's also magnificent and masterful. Expect some scenes of very graphic violence: People are crucified and tortured in other ways, including drowning, scalding water, bleeding cuts, etc. Heads are severed, and blood sprays are shown. Characters die, including some main characters. In one scene, a secondary character is shown stumbling drunk, but otherwise, substance use, language, and sex aren't issues.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages aren't clear-cut, but there's plenty to discuss.

Expect lots of strong language, including  swear words (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more) and graphic descriptions of sexual situations such as incest, affairs, and threesomes. Viewers will see multiple sexual situations; there's no \"live\" nudity, but an explicit portrait of one of the characters is shown frequently. Expect several violent incidents (murders, a shooting, a car accident, vehicular assault) and images of their aftermath. Characters also do a lot of day drinking, sometimes to excess, and heroin use is a plot point. Directed by Paul Feig of Bridesmaids fame, the film (based on the novel by Darcey Bell) also stars Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians) and Andrew Rannells.\n|Positive Messages|: You could say that \"crime doesn't pay\" could apply and that hard work and courage do pay off, but it's not a message film, and there's plenty of iffy stuff too.\n|Positive Role Models|: Stephanie is smart, loyal, determined. She overcomes fear and low expectations to become her best self.\n|Violence & Scariness|: (Possible spoiler alert!) A decomposed body is shown. The results of a woman being hit in the face with a wrench are shown, though the moment of impact is not. A brutal drowning is depicted. Someone is murdered in a fire, someone else is shot, and a character is hit by a car.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several sexual situations are shown or described, including an incestuous relationship, public sex, and a threesome (described only).

Sexual descriptions.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several brands are shown as being part of the finer life -- cars, blenders, etc. -- but mostly, there are frequent blatant plugs for Aviation Gin, which happens to be owned by star Blake Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds. It doesn't play as an in-joke, but in-your-face product placement.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Extensive day drinking by both main characters, including drunkenness.

It centers around a theater-owning koala (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) who decides to run a talent contest to boost ticket sales for his financially flagging theater. The A-list voice cast, reality talent show premise, familiar pop songs, and cute animal characters make this an appealing pick for families with young kids. But note that there's some peril/danger: Angry gangster bears try to kill a cheating mouse, a gorilla thief is mean to his son, and a building collapses spectacularly, putting many key characters in danger. There are also slapstick laughs, silly jokes, risque moments (from bunny singers waggling their bottoms while they sing \"oh my gosh, look at her butt!\" to a pig husband passionately kissing his wife after she performs in a sexy costume), and insult language (\"stupid,\" \"porky,\" etc.). And while the movie clearly promotes trying hard, being brave, working together, and following your dreams, it also has some stereotypes and mixed messages about lying, parent-child relationships, and the value of motherhood/homemaking.\n|Educational Value|: Offers some background about the difference between high art and performance and popular art.\n|Positive Messages|: Clear messages about believing in yourself, pursuing your dreams, being brave, trying hard, working together, and performing for the joy of it -- but it's important not to overlook the fact that Buster lies to everyone and still comes out OK/is rescued in the end (though you can also interpret events as conveying the idea that lying to others doesn't succeed and cheaters get found out). Some viewers may also raise an eyebrow at what Rosita's story says about how the movie views motherhood/homemaking.\n|Positive Role Models|: A mixed bag. The characters work hard, pursue their dreams, and learn to believe in themselves, but they're not all clear-cut role models, and there's some stereotyping based on gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Rosita is a devoted wife and mom who manages to take care of her family even while auditioning and rehearsing for the show, but her husband/kids don't even register her absence for days/weeks, which raises serious questions about how the movie views the value of her role at home. Johnny wants to be his own person and not just follow the family business (crime), but he also desperately wants his convict father's approval. Mike is consistently egotistical, rude, and dismissive to others (even calling them names), but he eventually sort of discovers the value of teamwork and others' talent. When forced to, Buster comes clean about his lies and ends up showcasing the talent and what his theater is capable of producing (but he's also rescued by others after making serious mistakes). Meena is terribly afraid of the spotlight but learns to find her voice and follow her passion. Gunter convinces Rosita to let go and not be afraid to dance. Nana has exacting standards for what qualifies as art/theater.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mob-like Russian bears want to kill Mike for cheating at cards; a glass aquarium shatters, flooding and destroying the theater in a spectacular collapse (it's not clear everyone is OK immediately, but they are); car chases/pursuits. Police pursue an escaped convict with helicopters and more. Buster puts himself in peril to hook up electricity (illegally). A character is injured when stagelights fall on him. Ash's quills pepper the audience during her song. Some arguments/confrontations.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mouse Mike sees a female mouse, ogles/flirts with her, and they become a couple after he starts flashing his cash around. A male pig kisses his wife after she sings and dances to \"Shake It Off\" (wearing what, for her, is a quite revealing/sexy costume). A young, unmarried porcupine couple lives together until she catches her boyfriend cheating on her -- flirting, hugging, and singing with another porcupine. A rabbit act auditions to the lyrics \"oh my gosh, look at her butt,\" waggling their own rear ends. Another act performs a snippet of \"Butterfly,\" which has the lyric \"come, my lady.\" Buster and Eddie wash cars in their Speedo swimsuits.\n|Language|: Insults and exclamations, like \"stupid,\" \"fool,\" \"loser,\" \"porky,\" \"nobody,\" \"namby pamby,\" \"fat,\" \"jerk,\" \"holy moley,\" and \"fart.\" Possible use of \"hell\" in Ash's song.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie, but plenty of tie-in merchandise/promotions -- from apparel and toys to accessories, figurines, and Happy Meals.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Animals drink at the club.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776cac594b2b001e6fa3c8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/sing-2", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Sing 2 is the sequel to 2016's popular animated musical comedy Sing. Matthew McConaughey returns as the voice of Buster Moon, the starry-eyed koala theater director who, this time around, tries to stage a show at the glamorous Crystal Theater. But it will only work if he can convince the biggest pop star in the world (Bono, in his animation debut) to come out of retirement. Characters use some insult words (\"stupid,\" \"loser,\" etc.), there are moments of slapstick action, and a couple of scenes are violent/scary, like when a main character is nearly thrown off a balcony and later is actually pushed off a ledge (but saved at the last minute). A few conversations involve a supporting character's grief over the loss of his dead wife. A married couple kiss and embrace briefly, and two different characters flirt with love interests. Like the original, the sequel features dozens of hit classic and contemporary songs and has themes of teamwork, perseverance, and following your dreams. Most of the original cast members reprise their roles, including Reese Witherspoon, Nick Kroll, Scarlett Johansson, Tori Kelly, and Taron Egerton. New additions Bobby Cannavale, Pharrell Williams, Halsey, Eric Andr\u00e9, and Chelsea Peretti help round out the cast.\n|Educational Value|: Offers lessons in teamwork and perseverance -- as well as a bit of how showbiz works.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages teamwork, honesty, persevering to overcome personal and professional challenges. Like first movie, emphasizes following your dreams (though some methods used to get there aren't always ethical), but also focuses on dealing with loss, disappointment, grief.\n|Positive Role Models|: Buster is dedicated to following his dream but also lies to reach that dream. He cares for his cast and friends but doesn't always listen to their challenges. Meena learns to come out of her shell a bit, talk to new people. Rosita gets over her fears. Johnny stands up for himself. Clay Calloway rediscovers his love of music. Jimmy Crystal is self-absorbed, cruel.\n|Diverse Representations|: On screen, characters are a diverse group of animated animals, but main voice actors are mostly White (with exception of Pharrell Williams, Letitia Wright, Eric Andr\u00e9).

Animals get electrocuted. Buster is nearly killed more than once: nearly thrown off a balcony in one scene; in another, he's pushed off a ledge but saved. Someone is temporarily kept locked in a cage. Dance-style stage fighting with a weapon turns aggressive during the live show. A weapon that looks like a gun (but isn't) is used. Miss Crawly's eye pops out from time to time. A few conversations involve a supporting character's grief over the loss of his dead wife.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple embraces and briefly kisses. Meena develops feelings for a boy she meets. A character's nakedness is implied but unseen by viewers (the characters see it).

There's some mild swearing (mostly \"hell\"), open but superficial discussions about the hardships women face in and out of marriage; and some kissing -- nothing that most teens can't handle, really. Expect a bit of smoking and references to drug addiction too.\n|Positive Messages|: Single moms are painted sympathetically and their struggles are given some weight. The formation of their \"club\" underscores the importance of sisterhood, support, encouragement, and friendship among women.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the women bring their own different perspectives to the table, and sometimes their baggage, too, they are determined, caring, and open to what life brings them. Some of them are fairly harsh characters, however, especially Wendi McLendon-Covey's character, the publishing exec Jan, who can be insensitive and mean and makes bigoted statements.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A woman slaps a man.

The film includes tense family scenes, with a focus on reconciliation after angry flare-ups. Characters use some mild profanity (including \"suck\" and \"ass\"), and they drink.

They have offscreen sex, but both show maturity after, judging that they went too far too soon. Lena learns to stand up for herself. Carmen overcomes the pain of her father's remarriage, and Tibby drops her protective outer shell.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A suicide that took place before the movie begins continues to affect the characters.

It's sure to appeal to teens and older tweens who are fans of both the books it's based on and the four stars, who are veterans of TV shows like Gossip Girl and Ugly Betty. That said, the characters are older now, and this film takes on more mature themes than the first movie. Some characters are sexually active: One girl loses her virginity, only to have a pregnancy scare soon after. Two underage characters drink wine in one minor scene, there are heavy discussions about suicide, and friendships are tested in sometimes painful ways. But all of these issues are relatable, and it's refreshing to see a film take them on in a straightforward manner. It's also great to see empowered, interested, caring teens make their way in the world.\n|Positive Messages|: Miscommunication befalls couples who are clearly in love; a teen avoids the boy she loves after sex because she's confused; a father cuts off communication between his daughter and mother-in-law, an act that has helped contribute to a character's confusion about her identity. Loyal pals neglect each other, though they manage to find their way back to friendship.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ultimately, the girls demonstrate empathy and loyalty.\n|Violence & Scariness|: One character's mother committed suicide years earlier. More backbiting than actual physical fights.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A 19-year-old has sex for the first time with her steady boyfriend (only the girl's bare shoulders are shown; bare chest for the guy); her boyfriend tells her the condom breaks, and she later has a pregnancy scare. Fairly passionate kissing between three other couples. References to how another supporting character got a girl pregnant. Discussions about contraception.\n|Language|: \"Suck\" and \"hell\" are about as bad as it gets.\n|Products & Purchases|: Somewhat heavy name-dropping of colleges, including NYU, Brown, Yale, and RISD; labels for Ding Dongs and Duane Reade. Since one of the main characters works at a video store, lots of posters for movies are visible. A T-Mobile Sidekick, logo clearly displayed, is brandished often. A Nintendo DS is mentioned by name.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Two underage characters drink a bottle of wine.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776acb9ab5440021503a2a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/sisters", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Sisters is a rowdy comedy starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler about growing up, growing old, and learning how to be a better sibling. Though it does touch on some serious concerns -- such as building a life after divorce and forging a stable relationship with your child after a rocky start -- ultimately it's an over-the-top comedy with tons of swearing (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and much more), lots of sexual innuendo and crude references (including some detailed descriptions of past sexual exploits and scene in which a man who's high uses his genitalia to paint on a wall), and frequent partying/drinking (definitely to excess) and drug use (mainly pot and a substance that mixes \"Molly\" with Adderall). There's also a long scene in which a character falls onto a child's toy, which results in two other characters trying to remove it from his rectum.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the rowdy chaos is the message that while sisterhood has its highs and lows, in the end, nobody supports you more than beloved siblings. Other themes include building a life after divorce and forging a stable relationship with your child after a rocky start.\n|Positive Role Models|: Maura is disciplined, meticulous, and caring (perhaps a bit too much so), while Kate is ill-tempered and irresponsible -- but her heart is in the right place, and she's supportive of her sister no matter what.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A rowdy party gets out of hand, and windows, doors, and other things get broken. Long scene in which a character falls onto a child's toy, which results in two other characters trying to remove it from his rectum. Sisters tussle when an argument escalates. Yelling between family members.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of crude gestures and innuendo, and in some scenes characters openly discuss their sexual exploits. Many references to male genitalia, and one character, while on drugs, dips his penis into a bucket of paint and uses it to paint a portrait of said penis on the wall; the painting is shown throughout the movie. One character reads a high school diary out loud, detailing the many guys she bedded. Two adult sisters walk into their parents' apartment and nearly catch them in the act. Their mother is seen in a robe and heels, and the father appears to be hiding in a corner, seemingly nude, though viewers don't see more than his bare chest.\n|Language|: Frequent use of every expletive you can imagine, from \"f--k\" and \"sh-t\" to \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" \"c--t,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands/products mentioned or shown include Apple, Skype, Diet Coke, Jose Cuervo, Kohl's, YouTube, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Lots of drinking; some drug use. The sisters throw a party and offer booze to their guests, who proceed to get pretty drunk pretty quickly. Pot use, and one character, a drug dealer, opens a bag to reveal his extensive inventory, which he then describes in detail, mentioning drugs like Molly, OxyContin, and heroin.

Some of the dead are children, one killed by her own mother.\n|Positive Messages|: Issues of life, death and afterlife are dealt with in a smart, humanistic way. Depending on individual beliefs this could be comforting or disturbing.

The empathy the viewer feels for him makes his experiences all the more terrifying but his courage and growth through the film is commendable. Dr. Crowe's journey with Cole is multilayered but the complexity of their experiences does not deter from the trusting bond they forge.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scary surprises, some quite grisly.

While not as gritty/dark as star Daniel Craig's last two go-rounds (Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace), Skyfall has all of the ingredients that longtime Bond fans have come to count on: sex scenes that are suggestive but not explicit, frequent sexual repartee, guns, fights, big explosions, car chases, some cringe-inducing injuries and deaths, and constant peril. There's also some drinking and swearing (one \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t\" and more) and some almost flirtatious-feeling scenes between Bond and the main villain. And, of course, the requisite product placement for everything from Aston Martin cars to Tom Ford clothes.\n|Positive Messages|: While espionage and conflict/violence are glamorized throughout the Bond series, in this installment, loyalty, tradition, and the notion that \"right trumps might\" prevail.\n|Positive Role Models|: James Bond often relies on violence to accomplish his goals, is frequently driven by revenge, has his share of vices, and has been known to choose iffy ways of resolving problems, but he's devoted to his employer, MI6, and to keeping the world's safety in balance. His mentor, M, may seem prickly, but she respects him highly. The villain is incredibly malicious and seeks to hurt for sport and vengeance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Though not as dark/gritty/bloody as Quantum of Solace, in true Bond fashion, there's nonstop action mayhem, with a strangling, gunfire, point-blank shootings, an execution, huge explosions, hand-to-hand combat, stabbings, car/train crashes, the works. A character removes shrapnel from himself with a knife. Characters die from falls, being eaten by hungry animals (not shown explicitly), gunshots, and more.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of sexual innuendo and sex scenes in the shadows -- literally, with couples in darkness in scenes that show Bond's bare chest and/or a woman's naked back. Kissing. Some scenes between bond and the villain feel flirtatious as well.\n|Language|: Infrequent swearing includes one \"f--k,\" plus a few uses of \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"c--k,\" \"hell,\" \"bitch,\" \"for Christ's sakes,\" \"bastard,\" \"buggered,\" and \"bloody.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands seen early and often include Rolex, Aston Martin, Audi, Sony Vaio, Range Rover, VW, Heineken, Tom Ford, etc.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A martini, shaken (not stirred), makes an appearance.

Other scary moments involve the witch Maleficent and her ogre-like goons; Maleficent kidnaps the prince, and the goons beat him up (mostly shown in shadow). She also shoots lightning bolts with her staff and at one point dissolves into a green mist. Maleficent sys \"fools,\" \"idiots,\" and \"imbeciles\" and makes a reference to \"hell.\" There's one notable drinking scene where the two kings toast to their children's impending nuptials, and the attending minstrel sneaks enough wine to get drunk, falling down under the table and hiccuping.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Love has a lot to conquer here, namely the wrath of Maleficent, a mistress of unfathomable evil and sorcery, but it manages to triumph. The good fairies take matters into their own hands without consulting the royals they serve, which suggests that disobeying the rules sometimes can turn out well. Parents may want to discuss the wisdom of love at first sight.\n|Positive Role Models|: Defying authority works out well for Princess Aurora and for Philip, both of whom declare they won't marry the people they've been promised to because they've fallen in love with others. The good fairies are both resourceful and loyal. They also generously give up their magic during the 16 years they raise Aurora hidden away in the woods.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Maleficent is scary, partly because her evil powers seem invincible. She turns herself into a fire-breathing dragon to battle the prince, who fights back with a mere sword, almost falling down a cliff. This is after he's been kidnapped, tied up, and beaten by Maleficent's ogre-like goons (mostly shown in shadow). The goons try to stop Philip's escape by raining boulders on him. The goons also perform a creepy dance around a bonfire. Maleficent's staff shoots lightning bolts, and at one point she dissolves into a green mist. Before the princess pricks her finger, she appears in a trance as she climbs the tower stairs to the spinning wheel. Ominous music adds to the general air of doom.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A kiss.\n|Language|: Maleficent utters \"fools,\" \"idiots,\" and \"imbeciles.\" She also makes a reference to \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Sleeping Beauty is a Disney Princess, whose brand reaches far and wide.

The main characters -- young teenage girls -- sneak out of the house after promising not to. They make a date with a man they met on the Internet with the plan of getting him to buy one of them a drink. They then sneak into a club and drink alcohol. One girl secretly watches a boy undress (from the rear, nudity off screen). They vandalize property, imprison a security guard, drive without licenses, make an overweight girl feel bad about herself. Many characters lie, including adults. One of the girls loses a boyfriend by refusing to \"hook up\" with him but apparently brags to her friends that she did. There is also some bathroom humor and intrusive product placement.\n|Positive Messages|: Although some of the characters' problematic behavior has consequences (getting caught trying to order a drink, for example), plenty doesn't, and overall there's not a lot of responsibility taken or learned during the course of the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: The young teen characters get up to lots of iffy stuff, from sneaking into clubs to vandalism to making a date with an older man they met online. They also lie and discriminate a girl who's overweight. Not much diversity in the cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mild tension and peril; skateboard/car crashes/wipe-outs.

Starring the voices of Channing Tatum, Zendaya, Common, James Corden, and more, the movie is age-appropriate for younger viewers but does have a lot of physical/slapstick comedy (including many falls from great heights, all of which are survived) and a couple of cases in which dart guns with sedatives are shot. A plane crashes, and a flashback story shows cruelty/weapons use based on hate and fear. People and yetis also show fear and are pursued -- sometimes with tension/peril and destruction of property -- but no one is seriously hurt. Two characters flirt a little bit, a minor character has a drink at a bar, and there's infrequent use of words like \"crap,\" \"stupid,\" and \"sucks.\" The movie strongly promotes the ideas of appreciating traditions but questioning the status quo, thinking outside the box, staying true to your ideals, and giving those unlike you a chance -- in other words, curiosity, communication, and integrity.\n|Educational Value|: Offers lessons about importance of curiosity, asking questions, learning from those who are different from you. Also a few miscellaneous animal facts from Percy's show.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages curiosity, innovation, taking educated risks, and questioning the rules/the way things have always been done, if the old ways don't make sense or can't be explained. Traditions are valuable and should be respected, but don't follow them blindly. Promotes value of integrity, being true to your ideals, open communication. Listening to and learning from those who are different from you is far more productive than reacting with fear or disgust to \"the other.\" The truth can be complicated and scary, but it's better than living a lie. Friends, family, and community are invaluable.\n|Positive Role Models|: Migo is brave, open-minded; he values his friends and community and wants to prove himself to them. He makes a poor decision at one point but sees his error and helps set things right. Meechee is curious, adventurous, intelligent; she's constantly asking questions/looking for knowledge, wants to learn everything she can about the world. Percy is caught up in the race for ratings and fame but is reminded of what's really important: friendship, discovery, integrity. The Stonekeeper has good intentions, but he uses them to keep his people living in ignorance and fear for most of the movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Humans panic when they see the yetis, which leads to a destructive/tense chase through a village. A plane crashes (smoke, fire); later, it falls over a cliff and is lost from view (wreckage is later found). Other crashes/smashings. Characters jump/fall from great heights; they're scared but unharmed. Characters use dart guns that fire sedatives. Characters sometimes scream at each other in fright. Migo's mom is dead (happened long ago). A flashback story (accompanied by a slightly creepy song) shows cruelty/weapons use based on hate and fear. An eagle snatches a goat. Confrontation with an angry bear (quickly turns funny); one character is caught in a bear trap. One character gets sick, which worries the others.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting between two central characters; Migo is clearly enamored of Meechee.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"butt,\" \"dumb,\" \"crap,\" \"crazy,\" \"weird,\" \"stupid,\" \"pathetic,\" \"jerk,\" \"sucks,\" and \"holy wowness.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: YouTube, Facebook logos seen/suggested (if they're not exactly the real ones, viewers are meant to think they are).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A rattled pilot drinks at the lodge bar.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776876e6d55c0020413b18": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-smurfs", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although there's nothing overtly upsetting in The Smurfs, you can expect some potty-type humor and some cartoonishly violent scenes involving bad guy Gargamel and his cat Azrael in this adaptation of the beloved childhood cartoon. But no one is ever seriously hurt, and the Smurfs always triumph. The word \"smurf\" is used often as a substitute for other words, including, on occasion, curse words -- i.e. \"smurf off!\" or \"smurf me.\"  Many brands are featured in the movie (usually if they have the word \"blue\" in them), as well as electronics and toy companies. While kids might pick up a few messages about positive teamwork and self-confidence, chances are they'll probably just laugh at the goofy pratfalls and jokes.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is meant for amusement only, but the Smurfs do teach kids about teamwork, while Papa and the Winslows teach about the importance of putting family first.\n|Positive Messages|: The Smurfs offer positive messages about cooperation, teamwork, and family togetherness. Clumsy Smurf's transformation into a fearless hero is a great lesson that none of us is just \"one thing,\" even if that's what we're most known for by our friends and family. On the downside, in one scene Gargamel calls an older woman a \"hag\" and uses magic to give her a younger, more bosom-y appearance, after which a group of people rave about her transformation.\n|Positive Role Models|: Grace is kind and helpful, even though the Smurfs frighten her at first. Papa always thinks of his Smurfs first, himself second. The other Smurfs are optimistic and sweet. Patrick learns how to be a father from Papa Smurf.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of pratfalls and cartoonish violence, mostly involving Gargamel, who's always trying to capture the Smurfs. Azrael the cat is often thrown into danger's way, after which Gargamel says \"Are you dead?\" to see if he made it. A climactic battle between Gargamel and the Smurfs (note -- possible spoiler alert!) causes a few minor Smurf injuries, but there's no blood or deaths. One sequence in which Gargamel finds Smurf Village might frighten very young children, since Gargamel destroys many of their homes and winds up driving them off into the enchanted forest. Azrael also coughs up Smurfette's hair in a rather graphic way that might gross out some viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A married couple is affectionate -- holds hands, embraces, and eventually kisses -- in a short-and-sweet manner. Smurfette stands over a subway grate, Marilyn Monroe-style, but her Smurf \"brothers\" are more interested in the breeze. Grace is pregnant.\n|Language|: The word \"smurf\" is used as a substitute for many other words, including curse words -- for example, \"smurf off,\" \"you smurfin' crossed the wrong smurf,\" \"smurf me,\" etc. Also very sparing use of \"damn\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Many visible product placements, including Blue Man Group; Samsung Blu-Ray player, Apple computers, a prominent mention of M&amp;Ms, Aerosmith Guitar Hero, CBGB, Bluetooth technology, FAO Schwarz, ALEX toys, Madame Alexander dolls, and references to Katy Perry's song \"I Kissed a Girl\" and Braveheart.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768bd431c830024c14ed9": {"verified": false, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-smurfs-2", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Smurfs 2 (sequel to 2011's The Smurfs) is packed with pratfalls and comic violence, but no one is ever seriously hurt, and the moments of peril won't feel very scary, even to most young kids. There's lots of mischief, and Gargamel is a big comic meanie, as usual, though his treatment of his child-like creations the Naughties feels pretty cruel at times. Expect some inherent sexism in the damsel-in-distress storyline and some brief ogling of Smurfette and Vexy, especially when Vexy sings a slightly suggestive song (\"Ooh La La\") at the end of the movie. And, of course, no Smurf movie would be complete without fake swearing using the word \"smurf\" in the place of stronger words (\"holy smurf,\" \"son of a smurf,\" etc.), plus some jokes about farts and someone being injured in the \"smurfberries.\"\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, not educate, but kids will see some iconic sights of Paris, like the Eiffel Tower.\n|Positive Messages|: The central message is that family isn't necessarily biological, but made up of people who love you, support you, and participate in your life, even if they're not perfect. Also, that character is what makes you who you are, rather than your past or your origin. On the downside, the damsel-in-distress storyline reinforces the old-fashioned notion that women need rescuing.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Smurfs care for each other and want to make Smurfette's birthday special. But their personalities are largely caricatures dictated by their names/personalities (Grumpy, Clumsy, etc.). Smurfette is fairly passive and a bit whiny. The female Naughty is deceitful and manipulative at first.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Slapstick throughout, with lots of comic falls and near misses. Some electrocution, a biting animal, a few crotch shots. Gargamel tosses Azrael out of his moving carriage at one point. But no one is ever seriously hurt. Gargamel is very mean to his Naughties, sometimes yelling loudly at them, and at one point he says that he'll let them die of hunger. He also captures Smurfs in cages and essentially tortures them, though they don't seem to be in pain.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some minor ogling of Smurfette and later Vexy, the female Naughty, by the male Smurfs. One comic scene in which a male smurf says he's going to show his bottom and offers a half-moon. Patrick and Grace make lovey-dovey talk at one point and say \"tres sexy\" and then kiss chastely. Vexy sings the Britney Spears song \"Ooh La La\" at the end of the movie, with lyrics that are slightly suggestive (\"Baby come with me and be my ooh la la.\")\n|Language|: Lots of fake swearing using the word \"smurf\": \"son of a smurf,\" \"holy smurf,\" \"I nearly smurfed myself.\" Plus one very brief pun: \"that was ducked up!\" One \"oh my God\" and a couple uses of \"brat.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: A Sony tablet is part of the storyline, plus Facebook and YouTube.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769a247dd6e001f6c8244": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/smurfs-the-lost-village", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Smurfs: The Lost Village is -- like the 2011 and 2013 live-action/animation movies -- based on the beloved blue cartoon characters. But unlike the previous Smurfs movies, this one is completely animated and aimed at slightly younger kids (in other words, there's less potty humor and iffy content this time around, though definitely still some slapstick moments). But you can expect scenes of peril/Smurfs in danger, as well as one genuinely scary, sad sequence in which a character has (sort of) died. Despite the occasional violence, no lasting harm comes to any of the main characters, and the movie has a clear girl-power message, as well as themes of courage and teamwork.\n|Educational Value|: Intended for entertainment rather than educational purposes, but kids will learn lessons about teamwork and heroism.\n|Positive Messages|: Kids will learn about teamwork, your identity being more than just one adjective, and the courage to protect those you love. Major themes include girl power (there's a whole village full of fierce female Smurfs) and standing up to evil.\n|Positive Role Models|: Papa Smurf and Smurfwillow are wise, caring leaders to the Smurfs under their care. Smurfette is courageous, kind, and encouraging; the movie acknowledges her longstanding position as the only female Smurf and crafts a story around it. Most of the Smurfs featured have redeeming and even heroic personality traits. Gargamel is a clear villain.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Gargamel has a nefarious plot to capture and kill the Smurfs in order to steal their magic for himself. His minions kidnap the Smurfs. Gargamel initially succeeds in his mission, and it seems like a bunch of Smurfs are being drained of their magic. Gargamel uses magical balls that freeze the Smurfs. In one scene, it seems like Smurfs are going to drown in the rapids after being pushed out of a raft and plunging down a waterfall. One character seems dead for a while but comes back to life. A vulture attacks a Smurf. Some of the Smurfs in the new village use arrows and spears. Some physical humor -- kick to the crotch, \"joke\" box that punches a Smurf, etc.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Hefty flirts with Smurfette, who asks him not to be \"weird.\" Later someone repeats this phrase to another Smurf who's somewhat flirting.\n|Language|: The word \"smurf\" is used as a substitute for many other words, but not overtly for four-letter words (i.e. there's no \"smurf off\" this time around).\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie itself, but off-camera there's a ton of Smurf-related merchandise, including toys, figurines, games, and apparel.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776826eb5d26001f1dd404": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs", "cs_age": 5, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 5+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney's first animated film, does contain a few scenes that might frighten young preschoolers. The scenes with the wicked queen are especially creepy, as are the parts when Snow White runs through the frighteningly enchanted forest, bites the poisoned apple, and when the Queen turns into the old hag. While the violence is far from bloody, the queen does order the huntsman to kill Snow White and bring back her heart. As is to be expected in a film made in 1937, Snow White is a passive damsel in distress who needs to be rescued by her true love, the prince.\n|Educational Value|: Not an overtly educational film, except for the message that your should never harm the innocent, even when ordered to.\n|Positive Messages|: The huntsman makes an ethical choice to disregard the evil queen's immoral command to kill Snow White; he shows mercy instead. Snow White stays positive, never complains about her lot, and finds the good in even dire circumstances. The dwarfs band together to defend Snow White. Themes include empathy, integrity, and humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although Snow White is the classic damsel in distress who dreams of being rescued by her prince, she's also generous and selfless. She's sweet, loving, nurturing, and trusting, albeit naive and gullible. The dwarfs are also brave, as they follow the Old Hag after they realize she has hurt Snow White. Obviously, the Wicked Queen is an example of bloodthirsty greed and hubris. Characters demonstrate compassion and courage.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are a few possibly disturbing scenes, especially any scene including the Wicked Queen. The queen threatens and orders the huntsman to kill Snow White and return with her heart in a box. The huntsman raises a knife, and Snow White shrieks in terror. As Snow White flees, the enchanted forest becomes increasingly scary. Menacing vultures follow the queen after she transforms into a creepy old hag (the transformation process itself is quite creepy). After Snow White faints into her \"sleeping death,\" the dwarves arm themselves with their mining tools and follow the queen, who eventually falls to her death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The prince kisses Snow White, and the songs are mostly of a romantic nature.\n|Language|: As has been noted by various film scholars and sociologists, the usually overlooked first word of the movie is \"Slave!\" as the Wicked Queen summons her slave in the \"Magic Mirror.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Snow White is a Disney Princess, whose brand reaches far and wide.

The movie has some fairly graphic sexual material, including a sex scene, topless photos on a computer screen, and pole dancing. There's also strong language (\"f--k\" and \"s--t\"), and Snowden is shown having epileptic seizures. Other scenes show drone strikes and explosions, and there are sequences of hunting (birds are shot with rifles) and a character breaking his leg. Secondary characters smoke and drink socially, but Snowden declares that he doesn't drink or do drugs.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie champions standing up for what's right, even at the risk of personal comfort or safety. It suggests that, if we find ourselves in that position, it's the right thing to do, and we won't be alone.\n|Positive Role Models|: Edward Snowden is a controversial figure in real life, which the movie touches on a bit. But the bulk of it portrays him as a hero who becomes alarmed at what he sees and eventually reaches a breaking point at which he risks everything to do the right thing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Explosions from drone strikes. Men hunt, shoot, and kill birds. Painful injured leg, falling from a top bunk. Epileptic seizures.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Fairly graphic sex scene; a woman straddles a man and is viewed from the side. Topless photos on computer screen.

The body count is very high and includes important/key characters. Strong language includes a few uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t\" (once uttered by a little girl), as well as \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and \"bastard.\" Characters are seemingly addicted to a fictitious drug called Kronol, and a character's carefully saved cigarettes are smoked lovingly at key moments in the story. The material is dark, with intense themes about the behavior of humans in particular and society in general. But even though it takes a pretty bleak view of humanity, the movie (which stars Captain America's Chris Evans) still has some admirable characters who take leadership positions, prove their strength, and work together to fight difficult odds.\n|Positive Messages|: The train is set up like a miniature country, where certain numbers of people are kept in poverty simply to keep the economy and resources in balance; the poor people could be helped, but they aren't. One character learns to be a leader, even though he doesn't necessarily believe in himself at first. And a secondary character thinks outside the box, literally. He dreams of escaping the entire system and starting afresh; the two characters have different solutions to the problem of poverty and repression.\n|Positive Role Models|: One character learns to be a leader even though he doesn't initially believe in himself. A powerful female character is shown to be just as strong as any man. Characters work together extremely well to attain a difficult goal.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Very brutal and bloody. Guards beat up an old woman and take children away from their parents. Many characters are violently beaten or shot during many assorted fights, brawls, and battles. Some are executed point blank; key characters die, and the overall body count is high. Characters fight with axes, knives, guns, and other weapons. Blood is shown dribbling and spurting. A man's arm is shoved through a hole in the train; after a few minutes, it freezes solid, and the bad guys shatter it. There's a gross-out scene involving some bugs. Children are shown to be brainwashed in a \"school\" car, and other children are forced to be laborers. Some disturbing dialogue about cannibalism. There's a huge crash.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some bathing suit-clad women are briefly seen lounging in hot tubs and pools.\n|Language|: \"F--k\" and its various permutations are used a few times, plus \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"bastards,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" and English slang like \"shite.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters are highly addicted to a fictitious drug called \"Kronol,\" which one character describes as \"industrial waste.\" Chunks of Kronol are stolen and used as bargaining chips.

There are several references to sexual relationships, adultery (Cyrus's character is a private investigator), and strong language (mostly \"s--t\" and \"ass\"). The sorority sisters drink, talk about their boyfriends, and even their \"personal massagers.\" Meanwhile, the protagonist learns that people can surprise you and that \"sisterhood\" is a powerful force.\n|Positive Messages|: This isn't exactly a movie with heavy-hitting messages, but through Molly's adventure, viewers may catch on to the idea that people are more than they seem at first (like the fact that she realizes sorority sisters aren't all superficial and stupid), and that teamwork makes difficult tasks much easier than attempting to do everything by yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: Molly is a devoted daughter with a close relationship with her father, an observant private investigator, and an intelligent student. She encourages her sorority sisters to see past each other's faults and to work together to help a sister in need.\n|Violence & Scariness|: An angry girlfriend pours punch on top of her philandering boyfriend. Molly punches a guy and ties him up, and she's later involved in a car chase and a fight at gun-point to free a friend from being taken hostage. Pepper spray is used to immobilize a man, and a car blows up but doesn't injure anyone. No one dies, and no one is seriously hurt.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's some kissing (between the protagonist and her love interest as well as other couples). There are references to sexual relationships, infidelity (Molly and her father track suspected cheaters for a living), some skimpy outfits (the sorority sisters fundraise by wearing teeny tiny bikinis during car washes), etc. There's also one joke involving a young woman's \"personal massager,\" which is obviously a vibrator (although that word is never said).\n|Language|: There is \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"assh--e,\" and a couple of religious exclamations like \"Jesus!\" and \"holy s--t!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Maybelline, Max Factor, LL Bean, Apple, Volkswagen, and other brands are mentioned or featured in the movie.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: College students -- most of whom are underage -- drink and play drinking games at fraternity/sorority parties.

Wendy also has a habit of fibbing, which gets her into pretty big trouble.\n|Positive Messages|: Overall struggle for harmony wins out over characters' weaknesses.\n|Positive Role Models|: Emily and her friends are the underdogs, so their diversity stands out against the snotty Malibu girls.

The people interviewed are unusual experts, in that many of them helped create the most popular social media sites today. Now they are speaking publicly about how the business model behind these sites treats customers as products to sell to advertisers. Teens may see their own experiences reflected in a fictional narrative set up to show the effects of social media addiction, the psychological harm of relying on social media for positive reinforcement, and the results of widespread misinformation. Violence is seen in images on the news, including protests, riots, fires, mobs, and bombings. In fictionalized scenes, a young girl breaks open a plastic jar to get at her phone, and a teen and his sister are arrested at a protest. Addiction to social media is compared to drug use, and interviewees discuss rates of self-harm and suicide among teens and tweens. At the end, the experts make a few recommendations that we can all do to try to reduce the hold social media has on us. Language includes \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" and exclamatory use of \"God.\" The documentary doesn't offer much diversity of experts/opinions.\n|Positive Messages|: Social media can be both utopia and dystopia. Its business model is based on selling our attention to the highest advertising bidders. Echo chambers it creates for individuals is leading directly to misinformation, polarization, chaos. But individuals can take steps to reduce and redirect their own consumption of social media, and public pressure could bring about greater regulation, changes to the business model.\n|Positive Role Models|: A series of former executives who helped create tech companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, among others, is speaking out about dangers of social media, the steps society needs to take to minimize the harm these companies are causing and havoc they have the potential to wreak.

The sexual content includes scenes of strip poker, a scene set the morning after a one-night stand, bathroom-stall trysts (with implied oral sex), girls dancing nearly naked, and more. College students party a lot, so it's no surprise that there's plenty of drinking -- often to excess -- and drug use (mostly marijuana, but also cocaine). While teens will learn the value of being innovative, there are some very negative messages and role models in the movie. Ultimately, The Social Network isn't the typical \"genius entrepreneur\" biopic, because it's really a story about the personal price of success.\n|Positive Messages|: On the one hand, seeing all these young entrepreneurs be creative and innovative is a great example for teenagers, but some of the actions that lead to Facebook's success are shady and unfortunate.\n|Positive Role Models|: They're big thinkers with great ideas, but many of the characters make questionable, borderline unethical decisions. Mark alienates and forces out his best friend, and he's accused of stealing the overall idea of Facebook from three other Harvard students. The character of Sean Parker is egomaniacal, parties a lot, and is the main catalyst for some of the uglier wheeling and dealing that goes on behind the scenes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A couple of men nearly come to blows but are stopped by their friends before an actual punch is thrown. In one scene, security comes to escort a character after he violently destroys a laptop.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sexuality is one of the main themes (and one of the major motivations for Facebook) of the movie. No graphic is sex depicted, but in one scene two young women take Mark and Eduardo to bathroom stalls, where they kiss passionately before the women take off the guys' belts and perform oral sex (you see one woman squat down before the camera cuts to the guy's ecstatic face). In another scene, a couple wakes up together but neither can remember much about the other -- including their names. The girl walks around in panties and a cutoff top. There's a scene of strip poker, and lots of women come on to the guys, make out with them, and dance around them while scantily clad. In an online pre-Facebook stunt, Mark pits women against each other for others to rank according to \"hotness.\"\n|Language|: Lots of casual use of words like \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"screw,\" \"hell,\" and \"bitch,\" and even a couple \"f--k\"s.

Many other brands are also featured, including Gap, Livejournal, Heineken beer, and schools like Harvard, Stanford, Boston University, Columbia, and Yale.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: College students drink like fish. Mark and his sophomore roommates get drunk and stoned in their dorm rooms and at frat parties, dinners, and nightclubs.

The movie reveals details about the infamous smuggler's past -- like how he became the captain of the Millennium Falcon and how he met legendary characters like Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Expect lots of peril, chases, and action violence, including scenes of large-scale ground warfare as well as executions, shoot-outs, and torture. While there's not much blood overall, characters do die. There's also a bit of language, some drinking in pubs, and innuendo (plus more kissing than is typical for a Star Wars film). Han definitely isn't always first in line to make the morally right choice, but ultimately the movie has messages about equal rights for all creatures and the importance of teamwork, communication, courage, and friendship. And the cast is noticeably diverse, with many female characters, people of color, and creatures who have distinct backgrounds and ideas.\n|Positive Messages|: Iffier messages like \"don't trust anyone\" and \"do whatever it takes to survive\" are balanced out by messages promoting equal rights for all creatures -- including androids -- and the importance of teamwork, communication, courage, solidarity, and friendship. Also explores how morally ambiguous characters still have a choice to make when it comes to whether they'll do what's right -- even if it puts them in harm's way -- or what's easy, even if it's wrong.\n|Positive Role Models|: Noticeably diverse cast, with many female characters, people of color, and creatures who have distinct backgrounds and ideas. Han is loyal and brave, if not always morally right. Chewbacca sticks by Han even when it endangers his life. Qi'ra is smarter and more of a survivor than people initially think. Beckett and his crew are smugglers but also abide by their own codes. Lando thinks mostly of himself but is willing to go along with plans that help others; he cares deeply about his navigation droid, L3-37. And L3 is an outspoken advocate for android rights.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of sci-fi action violence, both large-scale (warfare between Empire forces and those they seek to conquer) and small (close-range executions, shoot-outs, decapitation, one-on-one duels, a few three-on-one or two-on-one fights). Overall, not much blood. Chases, crashes, and frequent peril. A character is thrown in a confined space with a \"beast\" and is supposed to be tortured but ends up communicating with his torturer. A man is willing to kill anyone and everyone who crosses him. Spoiler alert: More than one supporting character is killed, both human and nonhuman.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several kisses and embraces. One main character is very flirtatious.\n|Language|: One cut-off exclamation of \"oh, sh--!\" plus \"hell\" and \"damn.\" Insults such as \"presumptuous ass,\" \"scum rat,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera, nothing, but off camera, the Star Wars franchise is a merchandiser's dream, with branded/themed apparel, games, accessories, housewares, action figures, Lego sets, toys, and just about anything else you can imagine.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A few scenes take place in pubs where characters drink and gamble.

Viewers can expect non-stop profanity, including \"s--t,\" \"d--k,\" \"bitch,\" \"p---y,\" and all forms of \"f--k.\" Sexual conversation is frequent, and sexual activities include kissing (straight and gay), partial nudity, and brief scenes showing intercourse.

There's especially strong language for a romcom (one \"f--k\" and many uses of the words \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and more) and a lot of scenes that take place while characters get sloshed at bars. Love scenes include kissing and loud sex noises, but nothing graphic is shown. Some of the movie's messages about love and friendship are pretty iffy, and the characters are sometimes unlikeable ... but in the end, as with all romcoms, everyone winds up with \"the one.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Many of the messages in this movie are questionable: that it's not as bad to cheat if one party isn't married yet, that best friends should be willing to sacrifice everything at every moment for their friend, that it's OK to lie about being gay so someone will stop hitting on you, that love justifies betrayal. Even if everyone winds up happy at the end of the movie, their choices throughout make the messages slightly confusing.\n|Positive Role Models|: None of the main characters is a positive role model. Darcy is self-absorbed, anti-intellectual, and conceited. Dex, despite having admitted his true feelings, refuses to change his situation out of fear of disappointing his parents. And Rachel allows Darcy to call the shots in their friendship and doesn't assert her own feelings. Characters are deceitful and betray each other.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character hits her friend in the nose with a badminton racket; a woman slaps an aggressively flirtatious man.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Couples make out and are then shown bare-shouldered in bed with a sheet covering them.

A womanizing man hits on many women and is sometimes slapped in the face.

Bigfoot's son, Adam, has been led to believe his father is dead; when he realizes that's not the case, he runs away from home and hitchhikes to find him. After they're reunited, they fight against an evil pharmaceutical company that plans to extract Bigfoot's DNA for genetic engineering. It's implied that the company unethically tests their products on animals, but the movie never shows animals being treated cruelly -- just a college intern (whose hair catches fire). One scene reinforces stereotypes about hunters, with talking woodland creatures calling them \"rednecks\" who relish \"killing God's most magnificent creatures.\" Headstrong Adam consistently makes risky decisions that don't result in real-life consequences. There's also bullying, frequent use of guns (dart, flare, or taser), and several cases in which characters fall off the edge of a cliff, potentially to their deaths (though all ultimately survive). Being raised solo by his mother, Adam's life isn't shown as empty or missing something, but one of the story's core messages is that no matter what kind of \"beast\" a parent may be, a boy needs his father.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, rather than educate, but there are lessons regarding teamwork and courage.\n|Positive Messages|: Demonstrates teamwork as method for overcoming a bully, whether of the schoolyard or corporate villain variety. Also shows that characteristics society may see as unattractive can hold a different kind of value. Message that parents sometimes try to protect their children by not telling them the complete truth, not due to lack of trust but because they're using their best judgment in a complicated situation. Argues that no matter what kind of \"beast\" a parent may be, a boy needs his father. Other macho-leaning views include declaration that powerful men have hair and that \"every real man has a son.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Adam, his father are always concerned about others' safety. Adam acts bravely to rescue his father and their woodland friends. On the other hand, Adam runs away from home, hitchhikes, dismisses his parents' wishes; they act more like friends than parents, and Adam comes off as being wiser than they are. One scene reinforces stereotypes about hunters. Women are sidelined, and Adam's loving mother is largely irrelevant.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several times, characters fall off the edge of a cliff with the immediate suggestion being that they died (though all ultimately survive). Hunters use guns to shoot at a bear, but the animals prevent the bullets from working. An enormous laboratory complex is blown up. Guns are prevalent, but it's always clear that they're dart, flare, or taser guns. An intern's hair catches on fire. Bullying.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Adam expresses surprise with exclamation \"holy crap!\" He's described by friendly raccoons as \"a stupid idiot.\" Insults also include \"freak,\" \"snitch,\" and \"jerk.\" A principal uses the words \"spazoid\" and \"friendless loser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a727a53e9001e7056d3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/son-of-god", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Son of God is re-purposed material from the History Channel's The Bible miniseries concentrating on the story of Jesus' ministry years, death, and resurrection. Although it's not quite as bloody and violent as The Passion of the Christ, the movie still features the violence of the crucifixion, like Jesus' flogging, the crown of thorns, and the nailing to the cross. There are close-ups of a bloody and beaten Jesus, as well as the two thieves crucified beside him. There are also scenes of dead Israelites killed by Roman guards, a child who is crushed and killed by a cart, and Judas hanging himself. Families must decide whether their kids are ready to see some of the more disturbing and bloody aspects of Jesus' story.\n|Positive Messages|: Encourages belief in God and specifically the Christian vision of Jesus as the Son of God.\n|Positive Role Models|: Unlike The Bible, which surveys major Judeo-Christian stories, Son of God concentrates on Jesus. Even those who do not believe in Jesus' divinity will find him a fascinating revolutionary who challenges the establishment, ministers to outcasts and sinners, and wants to change the world. His promise to people is simple: believe and you shall be saved. His disciples are all flawed, but they remain faithful. Even Judas, who betrays Jesus, repents for his part in Jesus' arrest.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The movie, which is taken from parts of The Bible miniseries, is quite violent. Jesus is flogged with the 40 lashes, forced to carry his cross, fixed with crown of thorns, and crucified. There are close-ups of his bloody body and bruised face. Pontius Pilate's guards push over a merchant's cart, and it falls and crushes his son, who is shown dead in his mother's arms. Crowds are stabbed and slaughtered. During temple scenes, there are animals being sacrificed, and people are pushed. Jesus is told his friend John the Baptist was beheaded.

Tonya jokes that she's going to make a baby with the neighbor. There's some vulgar humor, including potty jokes.

The famous blue hedgehog is also an alien with special powers that put him in danger in his world. While he's being pursued, his mama bird is shot with an arrow (she seems OK). For Sonic's safety, she pushes him through a portal to Earth with a warning that he must hide and stay on the run. Sonic never feels abandoned, but he is lonely. And the movie's messages, such as they are, revolve around the importance of companionship. Language is mostly mild (\"hell\"); it's more jokes about \"butts\" and \"farts\" than any actual swearing. One scene may raise eyebrows: Sonic and human hero Tom (James Marsden) stop at a roadside bar/restaurant where they get into a brawl (mostly punches), and Tom is seen drinking a beer and driving soon afterward, without incident. In general, the movie's violence is cartoonishly explosive, like an unrealistic video game: It's mostly drones shooting fireballs, lasers, and bullets. There are some moments of peril, but the audience is never in doubt that everyone will be OK -- even hysterically evil villain Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages about the value of friendship: It's how we survive. Treat others like you'd like to be treated.\n|Positive Role Models|: Deputy Tom Wachowski is the reliable rock of Green Hills but feels he could be of greater value in a big city -- he wants to help people facing life-or-death situations. His wife, Maddie, is the town veterinarian and has a big, kind, understanding heart. Their relationship is depicted as aspirational, supportive, loving and offers positive representation. Dr. Robotnik is a cartoonishly evil villain.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish fantasy violence includes drones that shoot lasers, bullets, and some type of explosive device. Punches are thrown both as a means of escape for main characters (they brag about it) and as a means of aggression for rough bikers. Two people fall off a building but are saved. A tranquilizer gun is used.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Language is more rude than profane -- words include \"butt,\" \"fart,\" \"hell,\" and \"freak.\" A couple of times, a profane expression is started, but the strongest word gets cut off/out (e.g., \"son of a ...\" and \"what the ... \").\n|Products & Purchases|: Pop culture references fly; some mentions of brands like Mello Yello and Amazon feel like they're meant as easy jokes; others feel more like product placement. Recurring joke about Olive Garden involves characters saying the restaurant's catchphrase, mentioning a promotional dish, talking about how much they love it. A Toyota Tacoma is also shown in a light that seems like it could be advertising. Other brands mentioned/seen include Volvo, Invisalign. And, of course, the film serves as a long commercial for Sonic video games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Sonic and Tom go into a bar where Tom drinks what appears to be beer; he drives soon after (without incident).\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5e5d3afb85f2ec003fd73c4c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-2", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 continues the Sega video game-based film series that began with Sonic the Hedgehog. The sequel depicts Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) as a tween who's determined to build a reputation as a hero in his community. Tom (James Marsden) and Maddie (Tika Sumpter) are now acting as his parents, trying to rein him in. With Jim Carrey also back as the comically evil Dr. Robotnik, the movie's cartoonish violence clearly isn't real, and most of the constant peril is unlikely to have a lasting impact on kids. But near drownings and real-life machinery that flies through the air could be scary. Sonic's childish outlook and humor (get ready for fart jokes) help make him relatable to kids -- so when he learns important social and emotional and life skills (like teamwork and personal responsibility), they might, too. Law enforcement officers use Tasers instead of guns. Mai Tais and champagne flow freely at a Hawaiian wedding, and when one character is under intense pressure, she drinks from the bottle. The same stressed-out character angrily calls someone an \"a-hole,\" and Robotnik tosses out comical insults.\n|Educational Value|: Delivered through humor and a likable character, Sonic develops social and emotional competencies including personal responsibility, self management, responsible decision-making, and relationship skills.\n|Positive Messages|: Heroes are those who take responsibility for others. For kids who dream of being a hero, a message is clearly delivered to help them understand not to put themselves in harm's way: \"You don't choose when to be a hero, your moment chooses you.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Sonic wants to help keep his community safe. When he faces an opponent with greater powers, he uses teamwork and compassion as tools to achieve success. He does lie, but in the interest of accomplishing something good. Sonic and Dr. Robotnik's behavior is contrasted to demonstrate what it means to be a friend. Sonic's guardians, Tom and Maddie, exhibit their love for Sonic, whom they see as their child, and show him they're a family.\n|Diverse Representations|: Tom and Maddie are a positively portrayed interracial couple, and both of their siblings have their own subplot. Supporting Black characters are positively portrayed. It's signaled that Robotnik's henchman is gay.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Considerable fantasy violence with animated characters often in peril, but little realistic impact. Animated characters are hit hard (including by a car) and nearly drown but are only temporarily stunned. One scene shows real-life large vehicles being magically sucked into the air and dismantled, forming a gigantic contraption used for evil -- but it has a silly face, and no one is hurt as a result. Law enforcement officers point and carry \"guns\" that are shown to be Tasers (a character is shocked, but viewers see that he's fine).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A supporting character is getting married, and there's an expression of romantic feelings and a kiss. Cleavage; men are seen shirtless. References to waxing, a groin attack, and the movie Magic Mike.\n|Language|: Language includes \"a-hole,\" \"butt,\" \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"we're screwed,\" and \"oh my God.\" Dr. Robotnik uses insults and hints at profanity when he calls something \"a piece of shiitake.\" Implied references to genitals, but not in a sexual way. Fart jokes.\n|Products & Purchases|: The Four Seasons and Oreos (positioned next to Chips Ahoy) are notably featured in what appears to be product placement. A couple of other brands are mentioned as humorous pop cultural references.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking Mai Tais is connected to fun and relaxation in Hawaii, both visually and verbally, including a \"Dr. Mai Tai's\" drink stand at a resort. Champagne flows at a wedding, and a stressed-out character swigs it from a bottle.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77702d594b2b001e746263": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/soul", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Soul is Pixar's thought-provoking animated movie about a middle-aged band teacher named Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx) who nearly dies and gets stuck in the \"Great Before\" section of the afterlife (where unborn souls prepare to be assigned a trip to Earth) and then tries to make his way back to his body. It's beautiful and creative, with themes of compassion, empathy, and perseverance, but it's likely to resonate more with adults who've wondered about the meaning of life than with little kids. And while there's no real violence, the movie makes it ambiguous whether Joe is dead or alive, which could upset or confuse some younger viewers. There are also philosophical themes about the meaning of life that might go over kids' heads, as well as arguments and a bit of insult language (\"imbecile,\" \"idiot,\" \"self-absorbed,\" etc.). This is Pixar's first movie with a Black main character, and the film struggles to sit comfortably with that: Joe spends much of the film outside of his own Black body, seen instead as a blue blob, a calico cat, or, in an eyebrow-raising body-swap plot, accidentally taken over and piloted by 22 (voiced by White actor Tina Fey). The all-star voice cast does embrace a diverse range of actors, though, including Angela Bassett, Daveed Diggs, Phylicia Rashad, and Questlove. It features jazz music composed and supervised by Jon Baptiste, as well as a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.\n|Educational Value|: Young viewers will learn a bit about jazz music, what it means to be mentored, what motivates people to live their best life.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes following your dreams, but not at the exclusion of human connections and relationships. Encourages not taking life for granted and savoring small, everyday moments. Strong family relationships and friendships are highlighted, as are having passions and interests. No life is meaningless if you feel love and have friendships. One person's \"spark\" may not fullfil another; we all have our own purpose to find. Themes also include compassion, empathy, perseverance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Joe is a dedicated teacher, a disciplined musician, a devoted son. And 22 grows as a character, discovering the small joys of humanity.\n|Diverse Representations|: First Pixar movie with Black main character. Majority of human characters are also Black and are authentically voiced by actors like Jamie Foxx, Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett, etc. Native actors like Rachel House (M\u0101ori) and Wes Studi (Cherokee) voice noncorporeal characters of Terry and Counselor Jerry, respectively. Several strong female characters, as well as genderless unborn/other souls. But the film never sits comfortably in its Blackness -- perhaps a reflection of how the character of Joe was established by White writer-director Pete Docter long before Black co-director Kemp Powers joined. Ultimately well-intended, Soul still feeds into decades of Hollywood's penchant for transforming main characters of color into nonhumans (The Princess and the Frog, Spies in Disguise). Many diverse cast members become stylized, formless beings who rally in support of a White- and female-coded character's personal journey -- including Joe, who for much of the film exists as either a formless blue blob or a calico cat. And having 22 (voiced by Tina Fey) piloting Joe's Black body uncomfortably evokes themes of Jordan Peele's Get Out, in which White souls use Black bodies for their own gain. Soul lacks that film's self-awareness around the flawed visual metaphor.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Joe falls down a manhole (nongraphic), and his body appears dead or dying. He's hospitalized and looks disheveled/jittery while walking around the city. It seems like Joe has died in a couple of scenes. Physical comedy as Joe makes his way around NYC with another soul controlling his body.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: One use of \"crap.\" \"My life was meaningless.\" Also \"meh,\" \"idiot,\" \"imbecile,\" \"selfish,\" \"self-absorbed,\" \"you ruin everything,\" \"you have no purpose.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mercedes decal.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77687ceb5d26001f1ed87c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/soul-surfer", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this inspiring true story about a promising young surfer who was attacked by a shark could give tween and teen viewers lots to think about, from trying to figure out their purpose in life (even at a young age) to trying to come to terms with adversity.

However, while the Star Wars movies are movies young kids can watch and enjoy, the bawdy humor and absurd innuendo and double entendre make this best for older kids. Characters have names like \"Major A--hole\" and \"Prince Valium.\" Ethnic and racial jokes abound; Princess Vespa, for instance, from the planet Druidia, is a \"Druish Princess,\" and when Dark Helmet orders his troops to \"comb the beach,\" African-American troops are shown using a giant afro comb to run through the sand. When Lone Star and Dark Helmet fight with light sabers, they turn them on while holding their hands close to their respective crotches, causing Dark Helmet to exclaim, \"Your Schwartz is as big as mine!\" One of the characters emerges from under the blankets in a bed with two identical twin women. There's some pratfall and slapstick violence, and language: \"f--k\" is used once, and \"s--t\" and \"a--hole\" are frequently used.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie is always irreverent and often crude, but the core story has the good guys triumphing, love conquering all, and friendship persevering.\n|Positive Role Models|: The good guys do the right thing in the end, and some characters change for the better (particularly Lone Starr and Princess Vespa). That said, there's some ethnic humor relating to Jewish and African-American stereotypes, and Vespa isn't a particularly independent woman. Dark Helmet is also whiny and petulant.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some cartoonish combat/violence. Princess Vespa shoots a group of enemy soldiers with a ray gun. Dark Helmet uses \"the Schwartz\" to inflict pain on a man's genitalia; he and Lone Starr have a battle with their respective Schwartzes.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Not too much is shown, but there's plenty of innuendo. Lots of groin-related jokes, the most explicit when Dark Helmet and Lone Starr activate their Schwartzes while cupping privates. President Skroob is shown in bed with a pair of twins. Much is made of preserving Princess Vespa's virginity.\n|Language|: \"F--k\" uttered once by Dark Helmet. \"S--t\" and \"a--hole\" frequently used. \"Ass.\" \"Son of a bitch.\" Humor often mined out of sexual innuendo; for instance, the famous line \"Your Schwartz is as big as mine!\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The movie mocks excessive movie commercialism by showing a Spaceballs-themed gift shop featuring a wide and absurd array of merchandise adorned with the Spaceballs logo. Lone Starr pilots a Winnebago, and Princess Vespa's ship is a Mercedes.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: References to smoking and \"beer-swilling space dogs.\" One of the characters is named \"Prince Valium\" -- he always looks drugged and sleepy.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a377a53e9001e6fdea1": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/spectre", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Spectre, the 24th entry in the James Bond franchise (and the fourth starring Daniel Craig), continues in its recent predecessors' bloody tradition, high on both violence/thrills and excitement. Expect plenty of the adrenaline-fueled action sequences (shoot-outs, chases, explosions, etc.) that signify a Bond film, as well as some cringe-inducing moments (a man's eyes are gouged, someone drills into another's brain) and a suicide by gunshot. The movie touches on the topic of adoption/foster families (references to Bond's foster brother being angry about Bond's relationship with the other boy's biological dad). There's also some swearing (including \"s--t\"), though nothing too over-the-top, as well as plenty of innuendo, kissing, and groping, as is always the case with Bond. And, of course, there's the classic martini (shaken, not stirred), and the requisite product placement for everything from Aston Martin cars to Omega watches.\n|Positive Messages|: While espionage and conflict/violence are glamorized throughout the Bond series, it's also clear that loyalty has its value, especially when you're loyal to someone deserving. Getting a different perspective on life can also help you reframe your priorities.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bond often relies on violence to accomplish his goals, is frequently driven by revenge, has his share of vices, and has been known to choose iffy ways of resolving problems, but he's loyal to the end, determined to carry out a mission from his previous mentor, even if she's not around to see it completed.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence isn't constant, but at some key moments, it's relentless. And when the story calls for it, the audience isn't spared brutality. People shoot at each other with the intent to kill, cars explode, helicopters and airplanes go haywire, hand-to-hand combat is bone-crunching, and at one point, a man's eyes are gouged. In another scene, a man drills into another's brain. Someone commits suicide via a gunshot to the head.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of innuendo and passionate kissing, with a clear understanding that intercourse is about to happen. But no outright/graphic nudity.\n|Language|: Language includes \"damn\" and \"s--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands seen early and often include Aston Martin, Jaguar, Rolls Royce, Range Rover, Omega watches, and Sony.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Bond's iconic vodka martini makes an appearance, shaken and dirty.

Other themes include integrity, self-control, perseverance, and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter Parker is one of the comic book world's more thoughtful heroes.

Cars (taxis, most often) are thrown into buildings, heroes and villains throw each other from high buildings, and, perhaps most disturbingly, the wife of a character is killed when glass in a building shatters and the shards fly straight for her face. There is some drinking -- a character is shown drinking whiskey at a bar and at home. Beyond this, the film raises important metaphorical questions about the importance of using your talents and gifts to their peak potential instead of casting them aside in order to be \"normal.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Those who are blessed with talents and abilities that exceed those around them should apply these gifts to their fullest potential, rather than casting them aside in order to appear \"normal.\" Fight crime and injustice wherever you see it.

Comic book violence: Superheroes and supervillains do battle on skyscrapers, on the street, throwing each other to and fro. A taxi is thrown inside a coffee shop. An old woman is taken hostage by a supervillain and left to hang by her umbrella on the edge of a skyscraper.

In this installment, a mysterious black goo makes Peter/Spider-Man significantly more aggressive, arrogant, and combative -- even toward his friends -- which could confuse little kids who have clear ideas about their hero. His negative behavior culminates in him physically harming two people he loves (naturally, he redeems himself by the end). Thanks to the enormous amount of Spidey merchandise and marketing, younger children may want to see this movie -- but know that the action might be too intense for the early-elementary set. (Spoiler Alert: Two characters die during the climactic battle sequence.)\n|Positive Messages|: Several characters realize that it's never too late to stop making self-destructive choices. Strong themes of redemption and loyalty. Only one character stays selfish throughout the entire film.\n|Positive Role Models|: A mysterious black goo makes Peter/Spidey significantly more aggressive, arrogant, and combative -- even toward his friends. His negative behavior culminates in him physically harming two people he loves, but he ultimately redeems himself. Two more villains are introduced: Daily Bugle photographer Eddie Brock transforms into Venom, and prison escapee Flint Marko morphs into the Sandman. But Sandman, unlike Venom, has a heart -- he just wants money to save his sick little girl.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Long, nail-biting sequences of superhero action/violence, including Harry attacking Spider-Man in an impressive airborne fight. Blood is visible on a wounded character's shirt and face and also on a dagger. A couple of major characters are killed, and someone's face is disfigured in a fight. Peter shockingly strikes someone he loves.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Various characters kiss; one romantic dance between Peter and Gwen.\n|Language|: Expletives like \"damn\" and \"ass.\" A few taunts like \"chump\" and \"nerd.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Harry drinks on several occasions and at one point chugs hard liquor.

Starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the tween-friendly sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming -- which takes place on a high school trip to Europe -- deals with the aftermath of the Big Snap and other major losses, but it's also fun and comical. Expect a bit more action violence than in Homecoming, even accounting for eventual twists and turns that reveal that not everything (including the violence) is what it seems. And some of the video game-like battle scenes are literally dizzying. Characters are injured and shot at, there's massive destruction (much caused by super-strong water/fire/air monsters), and Spider-Man is so wounded that he looks battered and requires medical attention. Occasional strong language includes \"d--kwad,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" and one cut-off \"what the f--k.\" There's a jokey reference to a pay-per-view adult movie that many kids will miss, and Peter is shirtless and changes in a few scenes. Romance includes flirting, lots of discussion about liking someone/dating, and some hand-holding and a few brief kisses. The cast is realistically diverse for a New York City high school and includes characters of various backgrounds and sizes. As with all superhero movies, the themes focus on power and responsibility, leadership, courage, confidence, perseverance, and rising up to face your destiny. Note: This review is for the original theatrical version of the film; an extended cut is also available and may include additional content not covered here.\n|Positive Messages|: Spider-Man's core message continues to be \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Peter takes that seriously, looking for ways to keep family and friends safe -- complete strangers, too. Other messages include balancing personal needs and desires with good you can do for greater community; believing in yourself and your abilities; allowing yourself to grieve those you've lost; communicating with others to avoid misunderstanding or danger, or even to confess a crush. Courage, humility, perseverance are also themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter is courageous, generous, kind; he's willing to put himself in danger to save friends, strangers. He's also still a teenager who makes impulsive decisions and mistakes, like when he accidentally sets EDITH on a classmate or gives away something precious before completely thinking it through. Ned is a supportive, loyal best friend. Happy does his best to be available and be somewhat of a mentor to Peter. MJ is perceptive, observant. The villain isn't what he initially seems; he's manipulative, vindictive, theatrical, egomaniacal. Most female characters (Aunt May, MJ, Maria, Betty) remain in important but nonetheless supporting roles. Peter's high school/peer group is realistically diverse; his friends and classmates represent wide range of races, body types.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mass destruction during Elementals battle sequences, including frightening moments when it looks like characters could fall to their deaths. Peter/Spider-Man is routinely hurt, thrown around, shot at; in one case, hit by a train. Innocent passersby are hurt by collapsing buildings, super-strong water/fire/air monsters. Drones are used to hunt and fire at people. A person is struck by a tranquilizer dart. Nick Fury waves his gun at Peter and the door of his hotel room. Some scenes of violence aren't what they seem. It looks like one character is shot, and another one actually is. Peter gets stitches, is moderately injured. In a frightening vision, Peter imagines his dead superhero friend as a corpse emerging from the ground.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting, a few quick kisses. Peter is shown shirtless a couple of times. In one scene, he's changing in front of a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; a student walks in, misinterprets situation. Another time, Peter changes in same room as MJ, who's facing away at first but sort of sneaks a look. Happy jokes about a \"pay-per-view movie\" without a title that Peter once ordered at a hotel (adult film joke that may go over younger viewers' heads). A rumor that Peter is a \"male escort.\"\n|Language|: Occasional strong language includes \"dorks,\" \"d--kwad,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"shut up,\" \"boozy man child,\" \"jerk,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"badass,\" \"stupid,\" \"loser,\" \"oh my God,\" and one cut-off \"what the f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Several Audi cars, a Volvo, and several Sony electronics (phones, computers, headphones).

Starring an actual teen (Tom Holland) as web-slinging high schooler Peter Parker, its spirit is very much in line with the original comics. While there's no shortage of peril and action violence, it's not as unrelenting or large-scale as in many of the other Marvel movies. Death is minimal (a supporting character is disintegrated), and even sequences like that in which a ferry boat splits in half, causing panic and mayhem, aren't too scary. Spidey does get in brawls with the main villain in which he's bashed, buried in rubble, and dropped from heights, and there are some explosions and fiery crashes (including a plane strewn along a beach). There's a bit more salty language than you might expect (including \"s--t,\" \"bastard,\" \"dumba--,\" and more), but it's not constant. Teens flirt, and adults kiss and make a few suggestive comments. There's one jokey reference to porn, and Peter is shown shirtless a couple of times. A house party scene shows teens holding red cups (the contents are unspecified). As always with Spider-Man, there are messages about power and responsibility, finding strength within yourself, being brave, and persevering. And the cast is impressively, realistically diverse; Peter's friends, classmates, and teachers represent a wide range of races and body types.\n|Positive Messages|: Spider-Man's core message has always been, \"With great power comes great responsibility\"; Peter takes that seriously, looking for ways to help his community and putting himself in danger to save others. Friends and family are always there for you, but you shouldn't do the wrong thing in their name. Your true character/measure of worth is who you are on the inside, not what you wear/use on the outside. Communication is important to avoid misunderstanding and even danger. Courage and perseverance are themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Peter wants nothing more than to use his powers to help people; that said, he can be impatient, getting into danger before thinking things through. Tony means well and wants to keep Peter safe, but for a long time he doesn't listen to his young protege, which contributes to much of the trouble Peter finds himself in. May loves Peter, but she does drive him and his friend to a big party where it's implied that teens drink. Peter's Queens, NY, high school is realistically diverse; his friends, classmates, and teachers represent a wide range of races and body types. Cool kids are members of Academic Decathlon. Female characters are in supporting roles; they're portrayed positively but don't do a whole lot.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril and explosive action violence; the bad guys make, sell, and use extremely destructive weapons to blow things up and abruptly disintegrate a character. Peter and Toomes confront each other several times; Peter is dropped from heights, bashed around, and buried in rubble; Toomes threatens Peter and everyone he loves. Teens in peril in a damaged elevator atop the Washington Monument. Ferry splits in half; passengers panic, scream, and are in danger. A plane crashes, narrowly avoiding buildings; fiery debris is scattered on a beach. Peter is dragged by a van; later, a wild car ride ends in a crash. Fights/tense stand-offs; some punching. Guns brandished in anger/as threats. Peter gets in skirmishes with petty crooks. Aftermath of the Battle of New York (from The Avengers) includes crumbled, damaged buildings. Behind-the-scenes glimpses of fights from Captain America: Civil War.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teenage crushes/flirting. One joking reference to porn. A few suggestive comments made to/about May (i.e. \"hot Italian woman\"). Peter shown shirtless/in his boxers a couple of times. Some form-fitting outfits/swimsuits. Teen girls play a round of \"F, marry, kill.\" Crude reference to \"screwing the pooch.\" Adult characters kiss.\n|Language|: Regular but not constant use of words including \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"damn,\" \"bastard,\" \"hell,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bada--,\" \"friggin',\" \"screwed,\" \"dumbass,\" \"jerk,\" \"crap,\" \"penis,\" \"lame,\" \"loser,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" \"sucks,\" \"oh my God\" (as an exclamation). One memorable exclamation of \"What the fu--\" (the word isn't completed). Middle-finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: Smartphones used. Car brands, including Jaguar and Audi. NASA logo. YouTube. Lots of merchandising tie-ins offscreen.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Party where underage teens hold red Solo cups; never clear exactly what's in them, but drinking is implied.

He becomes a new Spider-Man and ends up meeting other Spider-people from parallel universes. It's sure to appeal to Spidey fans of all ages, and it's more tween friendly than the live-action wall-crawler movies, but it's still pretty intense. And while the violence is mostly cartoonish, there are lots of fights that involve weapons (including guns), injuries, and even death. (Spoiler alert: One version of Spider-Man dies, as does an important supporting character.) There's also large-scale destruction, as well as frequent peril, suspense, and mortal danger. Characters flirt a little and occasionally use words like \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"dang,\" \"fat,\" \"stupid,\" and \"dumb.\" But kids won't fail to notice the movie's diverse characters and clear messages about friendship, courage, mentoring, perseverance, teamwork, and (of course!) the nature of power and responsibility. Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, and Nicolas Cage co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages about friendship, mentoring, perseverance, the importance of power and responsibility, and working with others for the greater good. Characters must learn both to trust themselves and to rely on others. Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith to succeed.\n|Positive Role Models|: Miles, like Peter Parker before him, actively works to find his place in a world where he's got powers only other Spider-people can understand. Miles is courageous, committed to doing the right thing, even when it puts him at risk. Miles' parents are supportive, encouraging, make it clear they have high expectations but also love him unconditionally. Peter, Gwen Stacy, other Spider-people each have talents, strengths they share with the group. Peter particularly helps train and mentor Miles -- and learns something about teamwork and selflessness. Strong diversity within central group of characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense large-scale action violence/destruction/explosions and close-up fighting/confrontation, nearly always between a Spider-person and enemies (monsters, bad guys, etc.). Frequent suspense/peril and potential for mortal danger. Chases, pursuits, narrow escapes; multiverse portal dangerously destabilizes the city. For the most part, superhero powers/laser-type weapons are used for fights/combat, but an actual gun is used to injure/kill a few characters. And (spoiler alert!) characters do die: Not only does one Peter Parker/Spider-Man die at the hands of a supervillain fairly early in the film, but so does an important secondary character later on. In quick flashbacks, various Spideys share whom they've lost; a villain's personal losses are also shown.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Miles flirts with Gwen using a move he learns from his Uncle Aaron. They later make eyes at each other but don't go further than hugging. Uncle Aaron jokes that his nephew has to have \"game.\" A married couple embraces. Uncle Aaron says \"smart girls is where it's at.\"\n|Language|: \"What the...\" (unfinished), \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"dang,\" \"freakin'\"; insults like \"janky,\" \"old,\" \"broke,\" \"hobo,\" \"fat,\" \"stupid,\" \"dumb,\" and \"pig.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Marvel comics, Sony headphones/electronics, Nike feature in movie; billboards show brands like Coca-Cola (and tweaked alternate-universe brands too).

It's fun, funny, exciting, suspenseful, surprising, and very moving and is sure to please Spidey fans. Violence includes a lot of comic book-style fighting and peril, with characters getting slammed and bashed around, falling from high places, etc. There's punching, choking, kicking, explosions, bloody cuts and scrapes, and brief guns and shooting. Characters die (one death is particularly sad), and lives are threatened. There's also brief sex-related dialogue, kissing, and nongraphic partial nudity. Language includes uses of \"s--t\" and \"ass,\" and a character says \"what the ffff.\" Characters learn from their mistakes and demonstrate perseverance, and messages revolve around the importance of second chances, helping those in need, the lasting impact of doing good deeds, and, of course, the connection between power and responsibility. Note: An extended cut of the film released as Spider-Man: No Way Home - The More Fun Stuff Version has content beyond what's covered by this review.\n|Positive Messages|: Core message comes from Aunt May, who believes that everyone deserves a second chance, that people who have means should help others who don't. Also argues that good deeds last forever because they inspire others. Theme about how revenge doesn't solve anything, only creating more bad feelings and regret. MJ's theory is \"expect disappointment, and that way you won't be disappointed,\" but she learns to hope for the best. \"With great power comes great responsibility\" is here too, in a big way.\n|Positive Role Models|: Spider-Man/Peter remains heroic and brave but impulsive, sometimes rushing into things without thinking them through and making mistakes along the way. Ned is a supportive, loyal best friend. Most female characters (Aunt May, MJ, Maria, Betty) remain in important but still supporting roles.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main characters (and most characters) are White males, but cast has a wide range of diversity in supporting roles, with characters representing a wide range of cultures, backgrounds, and body types.

It was aggressively promoted on Nickelodeon (which helped produce the movie). But even without the heavy rotation of commercials and cereal tie-ins, fans of the best-selling book series will want to see this big-screen adaptation; expect kids as young as 5 to express interest. But the under-7 crowd might be scared by a couple of intense sequences involving the goblins, head ogre Mulgarath, and the Grace children, who do get hurt (with bloody scratches) in the action. Although the movie is connected to merchandising deals with a few products, there isn't that much product placement in the actual film besides Quaker Oats and honey in plastic-bear containers. There's also no age-inappropriate language or sexuality.\n|Positive Messages|: Jared learns how to take responsibility for unlocking the fantasy world that puts his family in danger. He also realizes that he has to give his mother a chance and that it's not her fault her marriage fell apart. Mallory is a fearless fencer who can defend herself and her younger brothers.

After Lance accidentally drinks Walter's invisibility concoction and is turned into a pigeon, the odd-couple duo must work together to save the world from a frightening villain who's using Lance's face to commit criminal acts. There are lots of action sequences involving spy gear and weapons, as well as some life-or-death scenes in which it looks like all is (almost) lost. One character loses a parent; it happens off screen, and no details are discussed, but the emotional impact is felt. The physical comedy includes some rude humor (jokes about bird genitalia, for example), and there's a long scene in which a large, tattooed villain's naked behind is visible a few times. A female pigeon frequently flirts with Lance in his bird form. The chemistry between the voice actors is great, and the film has worthy messages about teamwork and accepting help from others. And for all the action, the movie also clearly promotes nonviolent (or at least nonlethal) means of negotiating with and stopping criminals.\n|Educational Value|: Viewers will learn a lot about pigeon anatomy and physiology (like the fact that the birds have 360-degree vision and have a single orifice, called the cloaca, for doing \"number one and number two\").\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes nonviolent (or at least nonlethal) means of negotiating and stopping criminals. Also focuses on need for teamwork and accepting that others' skills and talents can help, not hurt, you. Walter and Lance's growing partnership shows that co-workers and friends don't need to be alike to get along or work well together.\n|Positive Role Models|: Lance is brash, arrogant, quick to get rid of opponents, but learns to be more cautious, think of others, try to stop the villain from hurting anyone. Walter is kind, courageous, concerned with helping.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of action sequences and weapons-based violence between Lance and his targets. A frightening villain plans to kill all agents. People are shot at, captured, knocked unconscious; some life-or-death scenes in which it looks like all is (almost) lost. Physical comedy. A parent dies (off-screen, but the emotional impact is felt).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of flirting from Walter's pet pigeon, Lovey, to Lance (in pigeon form). She keeps fluffing up her feathers and sidling up to him; he responds by pushing her away or saying \"Not now, girl.\" Nonsexual nudity: Kimura's naked backside is visible and shown for a while when he emerges from the bath. Lance looks down into his pants as he starts shrinking into a bird and shrieks.\n|Language|: \"Weird\" and \"weirdo\" are often used to insult Walter.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing on-screen, but a few tie-ins off-screen, including a video game.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Gangsters shown drinking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768327e9a3c0020c6c2ed": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/spirit-stallion-of-the-cimarron", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a 2002 movie about a wild mustang stallion that cannot be tamed in the \"Wild West.\" The scenes of Spirit being taken away from his family, and subsequent scenes of Spirit's cruel treatment while men try to \"break\" him, may be too intense at times for younger or more sensitive viewers.

Characters fight; one is hit with a chair, and others are threatened with baseball bats and knives. A body is briefly shown with its stomach ripped open. Rifles and shotguns are seen and sometimes fired; characters hunt deer. Teen girls are forced to remove some of their clothes, revealing their bras, panties, and other underthings. There are also spoken sexual references, as well as infrequent swearing (including one \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and more) and some social drinking by adults.\n|Positive Messages|: Not a lot of overtly positive messages messages, but the film does explore the unknown possibilities of the human body -- and how a certain state of mind can exert control over our physical selves.\n|Positive Role Models|: Casey is a survivor, clever and self-reliant under pressure. She stands up for herself and thinks clearly in a crisis, although she gets very little reward for her strength.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Women are kidnapped and locked up.

SpongeBob (voiced by Tom Kenny) continues to be a wellspring of optimism and innocence in an underwater world full of comically self-absorbed narcissists, money-hungry bosses, and cranky co-workers. That said, this time, the villains are a bit more menacing than usual, and, in addition to cartoon violence, there's a live-action fire-shooting zombie leader (Danny Trejo) who tries to knife the heroes before burning to ash. SpongeBob and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) must also discover their courage to do what's right in environments that make it easy to go along with what's wrong. The two besties gamble and party all night in The Lost City of Atlantic City, with SpongeBob ripping his clothes off and one character observing Patrick passed out in a pool of what appears to be vomit (although it turns out it's only drool). Background characters also appear to be drinking alcoholic beverages. As is often mentioned about this series, there's insulting language (\"dumb,\" \"losers\") and attitudes directed at the two best friends. But even those who are typically exasperated with SpongeBob profess their love and admiration for their square buddy, who exemplifies how to be a true friend.\n|Positive Messages|: We all have courage inside of us. Themes of friendship and appreciation.\n|Positive Role Models|: SpongeBob is an extraordinary friend, and the creatures in his life give examples of how he's made their life more meaningful. Sandy is a scientist who hatches a plan to rescue her male friends. Most characters are animated, but a live-action White man is depicted as wise and good, while a Mexican man is depicted as an evil demon called \"El Diablo.\"\n|Violence & Scariness|: A menacing live-action scoundrel tries to stab heroes with a flaming knife. Villain burns and turns into ash. Live-action zombies are potentially scary, but also dance in an amusing way. Silly animated villains; one is said to \"execute his subjects by beheading them\" accompanied by a still image of his sawing someone in half. Animated villain is sliced into pieces and falls into a fryer (later, he's fine). Heroes face guillotine and an ax-wielding executioner, but they're never placed close to death. Cartoon explosions leave animated character singed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An animated female character swoons over a muscle-y character's strength. Mr. Krab is shown briefly as a pinup model on a poster wearing only underwear.\n|Language|: Language includes \"crappy,\" \"stupid.\" Insults include SpongeBob and Patrick calling each other \"dumb\" as well as using other phrases that mean the same; a wise character addresses them as \"losers.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mr. Krab is obsessed with having wealth; sometimes his only lines are \"money, money, money.\" SpongeBob and Patrick lose control gambling in Atlantic City.

Like the Nickelodeon cartoon series on which it's based, the movie has occasional insult language (\"jerk,\" \"stupid\") and exaggerated violence (basically everything Plankton does with weapons -- like guns and cannons -- and the threat of death to SpongeBob, who's offered as a sacrifice at one point). Some of the movie's humor will likely go over young kids' head (like the way everyone in \"post-apocalyptic Bikini Bottom\" wears Mad Max-like leather costumes, or when one of the gang accidentally lands on a sunbathing woman's back and she murmurs that it feels good), but kids will definitely get the bird poop and blowhole laser gags. SpongeBob isn't known for being educational, but the movie, like most of the shows, does stress the importance of teamwork and friendship.\n|Educational Value|: SpongeBob is meant for entertainment rather than education, but kids will still get a lesson in teamwork.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid some of the cruder jokes are positive messages about teamwork and the joy of working with others you trust toward a common goal.\n|Positive Role Models|: SpongeBob is an eternal optimist who loves teamwork, friendship, and making Krabby Patties for others.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Post-apocalyptic Bikini Bottom residents aim to sacrifice SpongeBob but are thwarted before he's killed; an ancient dolphin can shoot lasers from its blowhole.

Instead, it's a series of attacks, disappearances, wins, and losses that carry the heroes from one game level to the next. High-tech danger comes in the form of giant robots, molten lava rocks, troops of evil toys, explosions, light saber attacks, and crashes, some of which may be scary for the youngest kids. Messages about teamwork and family are consistent with the first two films, but are spoken more often than played. Latino characters are once again in the forefront, and the Cortez kids' wheelchair-using grandfather has an important role.\n|Positive Messages|: Introduces the concept of kids' vulnerability to the allure of technology. The villain hopes to control the world by keeping its youth captive to the wizardry of video gaming.  At the same time, almost the entire film takes place in a slick virtual world, and what could be more alluring than that? The movie also makes a case for the positive results of teamwork, loyalty to family, forgiveness, and charity, and finally, asserts that revenge doesn\u2019t solve problems.\n|Positive Role Models|: Assorted members of one Latino family are the heroes here. The Cortez grandfather is in a wheelchair (in the real world), and his disability is discovered to have both positive and negative consequences.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Nonstop cartoon action from beginning to end.

The language is unremarkable save for a couple of insults (\"butt head,\" etc.) and the famous \"shi...take mushrooms\" line from the other movies. There's more noticeable product placement here than in the first three films (particularly car companies and Apple computers), as well as many more scatological jokes. Overall, though, the message is positive and family focused: Don't waste time or delay what's important.\n|Educational Value|: Rodriguez' movies are all about entertainment.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overall message is a positive one -- that you should never put off spending time with the people you love or doing what's truly important, because time goes by quicker than you imagine. Even the villain's message is that people deserve to be punished for \"wasting time.\" Several characters reinforce the theme that if you don't spend time wisely, you'll live with regret.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Wilson parents prioritize their families over their jobs, and the kids learn to stop mistreating their stepmother. Juni and Carmen stop bickering to work together as a spy \"team\" again. Cecil has hearing aids, but the fact that he's hard of hearing is never portrayed as an impairment -- if anything, his aids give him an edge.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish violence and action sequences in which people fall but aren't fatally injured. No one bleeds or dies in the action scenes, even though the agents are using hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, and high-tech gadgets to fight their enemies. The kids use mechanized weapons that include an electrified lasso or whip and special gloves that can do serious damage.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A husband and wife share a couple of kisses and some embraces. Marissa and Carmen wear form-fitting, occasionally cleavage-revealing outfits and skin-tight spy uniforms.\n|Language|: Mild insults include \"butt head,\" \"bobblehead,\" and a brattily uttered \"STEP-mother.\" Carmen says the memorable \"shi...take mushrooms\" (a reference to the exclamation in previous installments).

Vincent is an imperfect, maddening man who often swears (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" etc., plus a use of \"f--k\") in front of Oliver, takes him to places unsuitable for kids (a bar, for one), and generally tests the bounds of conventional childcare. Expect plenty of scenes in which characters smoke, drink to excess (sometimes driving while impaired), and have sex (viewers don't see much beyond a woman in her underwear sitting atop a guy). There's also a scuffle between kids that ends in a bloody nose, and loan sharks who want to rough someone up. Oliver's parents are bitterly divorced.\n|Positive Messages|: Don't judge a book by its cover, there are saints all around us, and redemption is available to anyone whenever they're ready.\n|Positive Role Models|: Oliver is a wise, patient, forgiving kid who understands the frailty of grown-ups. Vincent is an acquired taste, but he means well and makes an effort to treat the people he loves with his best effort at caring. It may not be the textbook way of demonstrating affection, but he does care.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Loan sharks get ready to rough up a client who owes more than he can ever pay. A grown man teaches a boy how to physically confront his bullies, tips that the boy later puts to use, yielding a bloody nose.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A pregnant prostitute is shown sitting atop a client; she's only wearing a bra and underwear.

Starring Bradley Cooper (making his directorial debut) as a stadium-filling rock star and Lady Gaga as the struggling singer he discovers and falls for, this version, like its predecessors, revolves around alcoholism and addiction, so there's lots of drinking and drug use, often to excess. You can also expect strong language in nearly every scene, particularly \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" This mature romance has lots of kissing, several love scenes, and a couple instances of partial nudity, both in sexual and nonsexual contexts. And while the movie has messages about the importance of art and letting your voice be heard, it also explores heavy themes, including mental health, substance abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts, and more.\n|Positive Messages|: Although parts are more cautionary than inspiring, story offers positive messages about importance of art and music, letting your voice be heard. Promotes idea that show business, particularly music industry, can be demanding, manipulative, forcing artists into easy-to-market types. Reveals how dangerous, disturbing alcohol/drug abuse is, why those with suicidal and addictive personalities need proper therapy, support, rehabilitation. Compassion is a clear theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jackson and Ally are both flawed, but they do love each other, respect each other's talents. Jackson is an addict but also a dedicated, committed musician. Ally is supportive, loving but possibly enabling of Jackson's substance abuse until it becomes overwhelming.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A character punches people a couple of times. One scene in which an addict acts erratically/in a disturbing manner in public. Recollections of an abusive father.

Several sex scenes of varying degrees of intimacy that include shots of bare backs, sides of breasts, etc. Characters are seen in the tub alone and together; there's a quick, nonsexual glimpse of a naked woman's body getting out of a bath. Partial glimpse of a man's buttock as he receives an injection. A drag queen reveals her fake breasts for Jackson to autograph.\n|Language|: Frequent (more than 100 uses) of strong language, including \"f--k,\" \"f---ing,\" \"s--t,\" and, to a lesser degree, \"a--hole,\"  \"ass,\" \"t-ts,\" \"t-tties,\" \"bitch,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands/products shown include Prius, iPhone, Yamaha piano, Interscope Records, Saturday Night Live, Dodge Ram, Ford, Grammys.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A main character abuses and alcohol, drugs.

Some of the comic relief scenes have a flirty, playful sense of sexuality (Kirk has always been a ladies' man), but that's balanced by the mature depiction of a relationship. There's also a bit of language (\"bulls--t,\" etc.) and some drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: Even with its sci-fi action and occasional flirty sexuality, the movie has positive, welcome messages about individual responsibility, collective accomplishment, institutional tradition, and working for the greater good.\n|Positive Role Models|: Almost every character in the film puts aside something -- regret, pain, selfishness -- for the ultimate mission, with teamwork as its own reward. Zoe Saldana's Uhura is a strong female role model. Good cast diversity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The sci-fi military-style action violence is plentiful but not especially bloody. At one point, an entire planet (with a population in the billions) is destroyed. The crews of various starships are pummeled by explosions, struck with torpedoes, sucked out of hull breaches into space, and generally assaulted. A character is impaled with a sharp-ended staff; another falls to her death; another receives several harsh pummelings. Some fistfights. Humanoid aliens are shot close-up; a monstrous beast threatens a character.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some suggestive talk and kissing; two female characters are seen in their underwear. An underwear-clad couple makes out on a bed, though it initially seems like they're having sex. There's a joke about \"farm boys having sex with animals.\"\n|Language|: Some language throughout including \"arse\" (in the context of kicking), \"damn,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"whore.\" One clear (though not particularly noticeable) use of \"f--king\" in the lyrics of a Beastie Boys song played during a scene.\n|Products & Purchases|: The movie is set in the 24th century, but somehow Nokia and Budweiser manage to make appearances.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink beer, wine, and hard liquor, sometimes to excess.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776a0ef617c90020168471": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/star-trek-beyond", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Star Trek Beyond is the 13th Star Trek movie overall, the third installment since 2009's big-budget series reboot, and the first directed by Justin Lin (of the Fast & Furious franchise). There's plenty of big, boomy sci-fi/fantasy action violence, including space battles, crashes, explosions, minor characters being hurt or killed, hand-to-hand and martial arts fighting, and a mean, angry bad guy. A major character is injured, and there's a painful but comical scene involving his impalement wound. Language is infrequent but does include a couple of uses of \"horses--t,\" as well as \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"bastard,\" and \"my God.\" Two characters in a romantic relationship spend this movie in a fight, so only a kiss on the cheek is shown between them; there's also a brief scene of a woman throwing a shirtless man out of her cabin/quarters. Characters occasionally drink fine scotch or other spirits, but mainly for enjoyment, though one character does try to get drunk. Overall, the movie's good attitude and strong messages related to teamwork and diversity overcome its iffy material, making it a great pick for older tweens and up.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie celebrates teamwork, as well as loyalty to each team member. Each member's strengths are used in a way that benefits the whole. The group provides encouragement and a positive atmosphere in which members can thrive. The movie also champions diversity. On the downside, revenge is also a major theme.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the focus is on teamwork -- and no individual characters really stand out from the others -- they all go out of their way to protect their buddies, risking danger to save others. The cast is notably diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Sci-fi/fantasy violence. Big battles in space, crashing, explosions. Hand-to-hand fighting, martial arts fighting. Laser-gun shooting. Character impaled with a small chunk of metal. Cauterizing wound with heated metal. Minor characters injured/dead. Bad guys torture good guys. Some bloody scratches. Frequent peril/danger.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kiss on the cheek (two romantic leads spend the movie in a fight). Other brief scenes show a flirtation in a corridor and a shot of a woman throwing a shirtless man out of her cabin/quarters.\n|Language|: Infrequent language includes a few uses of \"s--t\" (\"horses--t\"), plus \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"bastard,\" and \"my God\" (as an exclamation).\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink fancy scotch or alien brandy for enjoyment.

Abrams' big-budget series reboot. The biggest issue is sci-fi/fantasy violence, with lots of punching, fighting, and shooting, a little blood (though not much), and some deaths (including an important supporting character). It's more exciting than it is intense. The main character (Chris Pine) is shown getting out of a bed he's shared with two alien girls, and there's a sexy underwear scene with a female co-star. Language is infrequent but includes a couple of uses of \"s--t.\" The main character is seen drinking in one scene after getting some bad news. As in the first one, the Trek team comes together to do the right thing, no matter how difficult that may be.\n|Positive Messages|: The characters have many discussions about following the rules versus doing the right thing, coming to the conclusion that there's sometimes no easy answer. Characters also exhibit trust and teamwork, working extremely well together. The importance of friendship is a key theme of the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters (a diverse bunch) are better as a team than they are as individuals. Separately, they're cocky, argumentative, inflexible, or just plain goofy. Yet they're all trying to do the right thing ... they just have their own individual ideas about what that is.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of sci-fi and fantasy violence and fighting. The bad guy blows up an archive building and attacks a meeting of high-ranking officials in a hail of weapons fire. An important supporting character dies, with some blood. Characters get sucked out of their ships into space. A character's skull is crushed (off screen, but crunching noises are heard); another's leg is deliberately broken when someone steps on it. A great deal of fighting, punching, and spaceships shooting at one another. Massive, destructive crashes and explosions. A character gets radiation poisoning. A volcano threatens a planet.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character is shown in bed with two alien girls. No nudity is shown, and nothing happens on screen; he just climbs out of bed, and the girls are seen to be there with him. A female character changes her clothes, and she's shown in her (deliberately sexy) underwear. Some flirting and kissing.\n|Language|: Language is infrequent but includes a couple uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"bastard.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Budweiser is seen in the movie, and off-screen licensing/marketing deals include a Budweiser promotion and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The main character is seen drinking (hard liquor) in a bar after getting some bad news.

The central villain, Darth Vader, creates a menacing presence and engages in several acts of violence (threatening, choking). Another central character dies, though he just seems to disappear, and several minor characters die or are injured, though the images are brief or non-graphic. There are also a few instances of mild language, specifically \"damn\" and \"hell,\" plus plenty of insults. Some families may take issue with the film's spiritual philosophies built around \"the Force\" as the central tenet of existence in the universe. For kids of the right age, this movie is an unforgettable ride through a vast galaxy of imaginative concepts and characters. Of the films in the Star Wars series, this one offers the best and mildest balance of drama and action for younger viewers.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: The forces of good and evil are very clearly defined in the film. The story's positive messages include hard work and perseverance paying off with results, the power of personal sacrifice in pursuit of a larger good, and accepting those who are different or difficult to get along with. Additional themes include courage, self-control, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: The film's heroes overcome significant obstacles to work together and defeat the villains, making great personal sacrifice and demonstrating exceptional bravery. Princess Leia is a powerful female character who defies traditional stereotypes about what a princess should be.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The film strings together a series of battles that feature heavy sci-fi violence, including lasers and the film's version of swords (lightsabers). There are some brief images of burned bodies in the desert, pilots exploding while in the cockpits of their ships, an arm being severed (with blood), and the destruction of an entire planet seen from afar. The menacing central villain engages in a several acts of direct and indirect choking of other characters. Alien creatures vary in appearance; some some might appear scary to younger kids.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mild flirting and crushes between male and female lead characters. The sexual content doesn't escalate beyond a single chaste kiss on the cheek \"for luck.\"\n|Language|: Much of the film's banter is based in mildly antagonistic relationships between characters, so there are frequent insults and one-liners bandied back and forth. Otherwise, there are a few instances of \"damn\" and \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No real-world brands or products are featured in the film, since it takes place in another galaxy. But the movie created a template for movie merchandising that persists to this day. Decades after release, its characters are still immortalized in action figures, video games, and countless other products.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters visit an intergalactic cantina where otherworldly beverages are served and strange substances are smoked.

The death of a major character's mother on screen is a particularly dark and disturbing sequence that may upset children. Kids able to handle the stronger moments will especially enjoy several exciting and imaginative sequences, from a white-knuckle chase in a flying car to battles against surreal space monsters. One of the film's central plotlines is a blossoming romance between two of the lead characters. Though their interactions are relatively tame, there's some mild flirting and a few substantial kisses.\n|Positive Messages|: The line between good and evil is clearly drawn; heroic characters demonstrate positive behavior traits, although one character is unable to choose the greater good over his own personal desires.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most of the heroes demonstrate great bravery, strong decision-making and problem-solving skills, and other positive traits.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Heavy sci-fi violence, although none of it is especially gory or detailed. The film opens with a terrorist attack/explosion in which a minor character dies on screen. One character is killed by beheading (no gore) on screen; another has his hand amputated during a sword duel. There are action sequences throughout, but the major violence takes place in the film's finale, a massive battle between human clones and robot drones that's depicted both in close-up vignettes and widescreen shots of many skirmishes at once. Perhaps the most intense sequence involves a lead character becoming consumed by rage and murdering the alien creatures who killed his mother.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One of the film's central plotlines is a blossoming romance between two of the lead characters. Though their interactions are relatively tame, there's some mild flirting and a few substantial kisses.\n|Language|: Occasional use of both \"damn\" and \"hell\" by main characters. Less insult-laden banter between characters than in any of the other films in the series.\n|Products & Purchases|: The film takes place \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,\" so there are no real-world product placements.

The movie chronicles the fall of Anakin Skywalker and his transformation into Darth Vader. The plot and characters grapple with some complicated moral issues and occasionally embrace shades of grey. In a sequence of surprising detail for a Star Wars film, viewers see Anakin burn in a pit of lava, with his skin turning into cinders. We recommend extreme caution and consideration when deciding whether younger children can handle viewing something that's this emotionally and graphically violent.\n|Positive Messages|: Unlike other films in the series, the messages in this installment aren't quite as clear, perhaps because the storyline focuses so sharply on a leading character's fall from grace, so the movie must embrace shades of grey in terms of morality. At the same time, the lines between good and evil are clearly defined, even if evil seems to win in the film's final act.\n|Positive Role Models|: These are the same brave, self-sacrificing, noble characters we have come to know from previous films. But because the film's story chronicles a leading character's descent into evil and darkness, there are far fewer strong role models here.\n|Violence & Scariness|: As with other entries in the series, the violence in this film is primarily centered around sci-fi battles in space and characters using blasters and laser swords. But there are a few powerful moments of specific violence -- for example the off-screen death of children and the beheading of a central villain. Perhaps most graphic is the final visual transformation of the film's hero into an iconic villain, which begins with the character burning on screen in a lava pit before being grafted to robotic arms and legs, all while visibly squirming and screaming in pain. It's a disturbing sequence; only you know if your kids are ready to experience it.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two of the film's leads are secretly married, and there are occasional romantic moments and mild kissing. The female lead is pregnant and gives birth on screen near the end of the film in a relatively antiseptic sequence with no graphic depictions of the birthing process.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Although there's no real-world product placement in the film, this series is known for its extreme merchandising, encompassing everything from toys and books to backpacks, clothing, and school supplies for children.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a961905001eb91f0f": {"verified": false, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Phantom Menace is a prequel to the classic sci-fi action trilogy and has a few scary and surprisingly violent moments, although there's no explicit gore. Viewers see the deaths of at least two major characters on screen, one of whom is sliced in half by a laser sword. The movie's climax cuts together a sword duel, two separate ground invasions, and a space sequence, all of which feature frequent lasers, explosions, and the deaths of minor characters and creatures. A key moment in the film involves the lead character, a boy of about 8, leaving his mother forever. The film's chief villain is a menacing, silent figure with a frightening appearance. The humor and plotting are aimed at children, but very young kids may not be ready for the movie's darker moments. Widely considered to be the weakest of the films in this franchise, the film will likely entertain children with its straightforward story and imaginative design; though it may also confuse those who've already seen the original films and aren't yet old enough to understand the concept of a prequel. Note: The 3-D version of the movie renders some scenes (like the pod race) more exciting and others (like lightsaber battles) more intense.\n|Educational Value|: The film is intended to entertain, not educate, but there are some clear messages around good and evil.\n|Positive Messages|: The film's story and characters emphasize personal sacrifice for the greater good. Positive traits like bravery, thoughtfulness, and inner peace are demonstrated throughout by the heroes. A key element of the film's plot hinges on racial acceptance between two alien groups. The villains are sharply defined, and their behavior is cast in a purely negative light.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters generally exhibit positive character traits throughout. One of the lead heroic characters demonstrates a disregard for authority, which is the only poor example set by the heroes in the film.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Heavy sci-fi violence, although none of it is especially gory or detailed.

Following the events of Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, the film focuses on the battle between the villainous First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and the virtuous Resistance fighters, embodied by the last Jedi, Rey (Daisy Ridley). Everything is on the line in this installment, which means the sci-fi action violence is ratcheted up a notch: You can expect even more major space battles, high-stakes destruction, tense chases/crashes, peril, injury, and fierce lightsaber duels (plus blasters, arrows, cannons, and other weapons). This movie feels a little more intense and darker than the previous two in this trilogy, with creepy villains and locations and a few explicit (but not bloody) deaths, including a beheading, a point-blank execution, and a body crumbling to bits. Spoiler alert: Several primary and supporting characters are killed, and a few of those deaths will be extra emotional for audiences. There are also some scenes with lots of flashing lights, which could be difficult for those with photosensitivity. While there's not a lot of romance, the film does include some longing looks, embraces, and a couple of kisses. Language isn't frequent, but you will hear \"ass,\" \"hell,\" and \"damn.\" Women continue to hold strong positions in the Resistance, and there are strong messages of courage, teamwork, hope, and loyalty.\n|Positive Messages|: As with whole Star Wars franchise, main tension here is between good and evil, light and dark. Characters discover nuances of humanity and how people aren't generally all one thing or the other. Story underlines idea that everyone has a choice about which moral code to believe in, which mission to accept. Your family/background doesn't determine your destiny. Promotes transformative power of hope, and importance of friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, trust, listening to others, faith.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rey continues to be strong, capable, courageous, but this time also deals with inner conflict. She must decide whether to follow the path of the Jedi or indulge in her newfound sense of anger and frustration. Other female characters -- including General Leia, Rose, and some new faces -- are well represented making tough decisions, leading bravely, and more. Finn and Poe learn to lead together and to put mission above personal conflicts. Their friendship and teamwork fittingly rallies the Republic around helping Rey. First Order is depicted as mostly male and largely white, while Resistance is notably diverse both in skin color and in various species, with women in leadership positions.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tons of sci-fi action violence, both large-scale space battles/explosions and one-on-one duels, shoot-outs, tense chases/crashes. A few explicit but not bloody deaths: A non-human severed head is unceremoniously presented to the First Order (some greenish goop, but no red blood), a traitor is summarily executed, an entire field of Resistance forces is shown dead, a character's skin and face crumble/melt away, Kylo Ren kills and maims many enemies with his lightsaber. One character's wound is shown close-up; a skeleton is seen. Both sides sustain lots of casualties. Spoiler alert: Several primary and supporting characters are killed, and nearly everyone is injured at one point. A couple of key characters are presumed captured or killed. A few deaths will be extra emotional for audiences. Many weapons are used in addition to lightsabers: blaster guns, planet-killer weapons, bombs, grenades, daggers, arrows, fighter planes. An officer orders an entire fleet destroyed. A leader orders an entire planet destroyed. Creepy villain, dark/scary locations, and a couple of large, scary worm-like monsters. Frequent peril and danger. Arguments.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters continue to have an intense, supernatural bond that sometimes feels romantic. Poe comedically asks another character for a kiss two times. Several charged/longing looks. Embraces/brief kisses (both opposite-sex and, extremely briefly, same-sex).\n|Language|: Infrequent use of insults and words of exasperation including \"ass,\" \"damn it,\" \"hell,\" \"stupid,\" \"shut up,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie, but off camera there's an entire universe of merchandise available, from branded/themed apparel, board games, video games, accessories, housewares, action figures, Lego sets, food, toys, and just about anything else you can consume that can be a tie-in.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682a880197001ec91562": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Empire Strikes Back is an atmospheric sci-fi classic that features some intense moments of dark emotional content, along with a few very jarring scenes that are not so much violent as they are psychologically jarring. Sequences such as an encounter with the villain in a cave, a character being placed into a deep-freeze chamber, and the final sword battle are all dark, scary, and packed with emotional weight. The film ends with a well-known moment of extreme violence, emotional turmoil, and parental abandonment that will have a powerful impact on young viewers. The romantic content is significantly increased from the first movie in the series, although it still remains at a flirtatious level with just a few moments of relatively tame kissing. This is the movie where the series gains most of its emotional and thematic depth, and while it's a rousing adventure told superbly, it's among the darkest and most intense of the films.\n|Educational Value|: Although this film is meant to entertain, not educate, a large section of the film depicts a training session in which the lead character is educated on the ways of the series' \"religion,\" which is really a kind of moral code and way of parsing the difference between good and evil.\n|Positive Messages|: The film provides strong positive messages around the ideas of always trying your best (or rather, \"Do. Or do not. There is no try.\"), avoiding the temptations of evil, and remaining loyal to friends. Major themes include perseverance and courage.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters demonstrate such positive traits as loyalty, bravery, self-control, problem solving under extreme duress, and sacrificing one's own needs and wants for the sake of others. This is the first time a character of color is introduced.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The violence is primarily centered around sci-fi battles in space and characters using blasters and laser swords. However, this film amps up the psychological violence, especially centered around the lead character and his interactions with the dark forces that have overtaken the universe.

The film ends with a well-known moment of extreme violence, emotional turmoil, and parental abandonment that will have a powerful impact on young viewers.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two of the main leads in the film engage in a love-hate flirtatious relationship over the course of the film, culminating in a few relatively chaste kisses.

Both feature abundant fantasy violence, from spaceship dogfights and light-saber duels to guerrilla-style war waged with primitive weapons by the cute Ewoks (which is played largely for laughs, though one Ewok is shown dead).  Robots and pig-like aliens are dismembered and devoured in Jabba the Hutt's dungeons. Jabba is strangled slowly by a chain.

Directed by J.J. Abrams, the sequel takes place approximately 30 years after the events of The Return of the Jedi, and although there's tons of sci-fi action -- space battles, crashes, explosions, lightsaber duels, and more -- there's less violence overall than viewers saw in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Villains do order the mass murder of countless civilians, prisoners are coerced physically and with the Force, and duels lead to injuries and death, but none of it is bloody or gory. With little language (\"dammit\" and \"hell\" are as strong as it gets) or sex, this is the kind of epic adventure that will undoubtedly appeal to Star Wars fans of all ages. But while younger kids may be familiar with the franchise and its many spin-offs (like the animated Clone Wars), they might not be ready for some of The Force Awakens' more violent or emotional scenes. (Spoiler alert: One death will hit very hard.)\n|Positive Messages|: As ever, the main tension is between good and evil, light and dark; characters must decide whether to choose the path they were taught or the \"other\" side. Just because you were bred/raised to be a particular way doesn't mean you have to accept that. The importance of friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, and doing the right thing is demonstrated again and again, whether with old partners or new friends.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rey is strong, capable, and courageous. Finn's sense of morality keeps him from being a stormtrooper; he's frightened of being captured and considered a traitor, but he summons his courage to help save Rey and do the right thing. Brave and skilled, Poe doesn't judge Finn by his uniform but by his actions. Han and Leia forgive each other for old hurts and clearly love each other. Han and Chewie remain the best of friends and staunch allies of those in the right. Kylo Ren is deeply conflicted. The First Order leadership are clearly bad guys -- and, like the Empire before them, they're virtually all white, though there are a few women in their ranks now (including helmeted Captain Phasma). The \"good guys\" are notably diverse, and there's a female X-Wing pilot now.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of sci-fci action violence on both the largest possible scale (planets obliterated) and much smaller (one-on-one lightsaber duels and firefights/shoot-outs), but hardly any blood/gore (with the exception of bloody fingerprints on a white stormtrooper helmet). There's a weapon that can destroy entire systems, and there are explosive battle sequences in which people die and ships burst into flames. Kylo Ren tortures people, both physically and with the Force. Quick glimpses of dead soldiers and civilians lying around. Laser guns of all shapes and sizes (handheld, ship mounted, etc.); bombs. Chases, crashes, and frequent peril. Large, monstrous creatures rampage through a ship; other creatures look scary/threatening, and the leader of the First Order is creepy. A man orders an entire village of civilians/witnesses slaughtered and cuts down an unarmed man. A young man has debilitating anger issues. Spoiler alert: Supporting characters are injured, one is presumed dead, and there's one very upsetting death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: An adult couple hugs tenderly. A young woman and a young man bond under intense circumstances that lead to romantic chemistry, but there's nothing more than a kiss on the forehead.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"dammit,\" \"hell,\"  \"little freaks,\" \"murderers,\" \"liars,\" \"thieves,\" \"scum.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera, nothing; but off camera, the Star Wars franchise is a merchandiser's dream, with branded/themed apparel, games, accessories, housewares, action figures, LEGO sets, toys, and just about anything else you can imagine.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A scene in an interstellar pub shows creatures of all kinds drinking (presumably alcohol) and talking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769ff47dd6e001f6cd581": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/star-wars-episode-viii-the-last-jedi", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is part of the billion-dollar Star Wars saga, continuing the segment of the story that began in The Force Awakens. It takes place right after the events of that movie and is just as violent, with several battles, explosions, space chases, and close-up duels. There's one rather explicit death (though it's not bloody), and several people die in battle, in some cases sacrificing themselves for their mission. A few times it seems like characters are near death, but they recover. Romance-wise, expect to see one quick, chaste kiss, and some slightly uncomfortable tension between two other characters. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren appears shirtless in one scene for no apparent reason other than to fluster a female character, and there's an odd shot of a character milking a lactating creature and then drinking the milk. Characters also drink cocktails in a luxury casino. Language is tame, with a few uses of words including \"damn,\" \"what the hell,\" \"shut up,\" and the like. Directed by Rian Johnson, the movie boasts several strong female characters, including both Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Leia (Carrie Fisher), as well as diversity within the Resistance and strong messages of courage, teamwork, hope, and loyalty.\n|Positive Messages|: Typical for the Star Wars franchise, the main tension here is between good and evil, light and dark; characters must decide whether to choose the path they were brought up to believe in or the \"other\" side. Underlines the idea that everyone has a choice about which moral code to believe in and which mission to accept. Explores how transformative hope can be for people. The importance of friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, listening to others, and doing the right thing is demonstrated again and again.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rey continues to be a strong, capable, and courageous character. In fact, all of the female characters -- including Leia, Vice Admiral Holdo, and Rose -- are front and center, making tough decisions, leading bravely, and more. Finn is determined to help Rey. Poe is often impulsive and brash, but he's also brave and intelligent, and he does learn to respect others' abilities/plans. While the clearly evil First Order is virtually all white (although there are a few women, like the helmeted Captain Phasma), the Resistance is notably diverse, with white, black, Latino, and Asian characters (as well as those from other intergalactic species), women in leadership positions, etc.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of sci-fi action violence, mostly large-scale space battles and explosions, as well as one-on-one duels, shoot-outs, and pursuits. One death is particularly explicit -- the character is sliced in half -- but there isn't any blood. Dozens of Resistance ships are destroyed, with \"good guys\" killed. Many weapons are used in addition to the classic lightsabers, including bombs and fighter planes. A couple of people sacrifice themselves in suicide missions. An officer orders an entire fleet destroyed, and another leader gives the order that there will be no prisoners, no mercy. The Supreme Leader of the First Order could be scary to kids. Spoiler alert: Supporting characters are injured and killed. A couple of people are presumed dead, and there's one notable good-guy death, but it's not as sad as Han Solo's traumatizing murder in The Force Awakens.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters have an intense, supernatural bond that's nearly romantic at times. A character quickly kisses another character before passing out. Kylo Ren is shirtless in one scene. Characters in a casino wear revealing dresses and outfits.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"damn it,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"stupid,\" \"nothing,\" \"scum,\" \"murderer,\" \"shut up,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: On camera, nothing; but off camera, the Star Wars franchise is a merchandiser's dream, with branded/themed apparel, games, accessories, housewares, action figures, Lego sets, food, toys, and just about anything else you can imagine.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters drink cocktails at a luxury casino.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682ba091de001f2e6c96": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/stardust", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although this highly entertaining fantasy will appeal to kids with its mix of swashbuckling adventure and romance, it's darker than cinematic cousins like The Princess Bride. It's surprisingly violent, with several deaths and lots of fights featuring knives and swords. The scenes in which an evil witch unleashes her fury are truly frightening (one with a voodoo doll may make even older tweens close their eyes), as is her transformation into an old hag. The subplots, including one about brothers vying for their father's crown trying to kill each other, may be too disturbing for younger kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Backstabbing, literally and figuratively, of Shakespearean proportions. A father pits his sons against each other. Brothers murder each other (with knives, poison, etc.) in a bid to take their father's throne. Witch sisters scream at each other as they try to find Yvaine and kill her. A young woman demands a present from a suitor she doesn't like that much. A young man engages in a one-night stand that produces a son. There are also homophobic overtones in terms of how a pirate is portrayed.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Surprising amounts of fantasy/swashbuckling violence, including swordfights, knifings, and sorcery that ends in murder (a man drinks poison and keels over, another man is pushed off a ledge) and destruction. In one particularly brutal scene, a witch drowns a man with a voodoo doll and uses his body to try to stab another. In another scene, she slits a victim's throat. Animals are also killed for witchcraft, and Yvaine is being pursued so a sorceress can eat her heart.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No nudity, but some kissing and a few cleavage shots. A young woman seduces a young man and gets pregnant (nothing explicit is shown). Tristan and Yvaine spend a night together, though the audience only sees them together under the covers.\n|Language|: Quite benign; mostly just insults (\"idiots\") and the occasional \"damn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Pirates drink, before, during, and after pillaging.

There's lots of cartoon-y violence and some gore, but there are a couple of gratuitous gross-out moments, with one involving blood and the other an infected injury. Speaking of gratuitous, there's also plenty of sexual content involving men getting hit in the genitalia, some depictions of women as sexual objects, and a couple of sex scenes played for laughs. \"S--t\" is used, as is other profanity such as \"whore\" and \"ass\" and a rude finger gesture. Teens and older kids no doubt will find the spoofs funny, as the movie touches on many of the most popular, recent pop-culture phenomena. But there's nothing else going on here beyond a gratuitous effort to pander to the juvenile mind.\n|Positive Messages|: This straightforward parody is devoid of messages other than product placements.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters all are parodies and behave for comic effect only; there are no role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Most of the violence is cartoon-y and slapstick, without gore, but there are a couple of gratuitous gross-out scenes: Heroine Kantmiss is shown with gory, realistic-looking blood dripping from her mouth, and another character's infection is oozing and gory. There's lots and lots of punching, hitting, stabbing, and impaling with arrows or satirical weapons such as a baguette, and much of it is revisited over and over in super slo-mo. The projectiles are shown going through the victim, but again there's no blood. One clearly fake stabbing includes computer-generated and unrealistically colored splatters of blood. A lot of the fighting involves kicking or punching male genitalia.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's a sex scene in which a large \"censored\" block covers most of the characters' bodies, but their heads and bare limbs are shown in many positions; another scene spoofing the movie Avatar simulates sex. Body parts provide a lot of giggle fodder: Men are kicked and punched in the groin frequently; there's a gratuitous \"T&amp;A\" scene of cheerleaders dancing and posing suggestively; and heroine Kantmiss \"motorboats\" a teen boy. Kantmiss and Peter kiss briefly a couple of times and once for a few seconds longer. There's a male streaker who's nude from the rear but whose genitals are pixelated from the front. There's a little potty humor in one scene wherein Kantmiss is seen squatting and grimacing with exaggerated potty sound effects, which is replayed later in slow motion. Kantmiss receives instructions to touch Peter's \"thing.\" Getting your first period is mentioned, and a 12-year-old character asks if another is trying to \"hook up\" with her.\n|Language|: \"S--t\" and variations are used frequently, as is \"ass.\" Used once or twice each:  \"piss,\" \"bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"turd,\" \"prick,\" \"whore,\" \"ho,\" and \"son of a bitch.\" An official salute is the middle finger, and it's shown a half dozen times or so.\n|Products & Purchases|: Lots of products are spoofed with slightly changed names such as \"Words with Foes\" and \"Tres Equis\" beer. There are a lot of clear references, without naming them, to popular apps such as Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja. A character is seen frequently using Siri, and the leader watches the action on a tablet with a clear Apple logo on it. Other products specifically mentioned include Cinemax, Viagra, Facebook, Twitter, Nike, Subway, Playboy, and Starbucks. A character's name is pronounced the same as the Toyota \"Celica.\" Many movie franchises are spoofed, most extensively Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, and The Avengers.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In a parody of a Dos Equis commercial, a character drinks and then spits out beer both in the movie and again in the bloopers at the end.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f35016fc551001ef800b3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/step-brothers", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this is a far raunchier comedy than the last collaboration between stars Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and director Adam McKay, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and much more explicit in how it stoops for laughs. It's loaded with crude, rude, sexual, and obscene language and situations, including visible male genitalia and glimpses of porn and a vocabulary that ranges from \"p---y\" to \"f--k\" and everywhere in between. There's also lots of product placement, and the film's half-hearted messages and morals -- about family, being who you are, and accepting people -- are drowned out by its loud, boisterous vulgarity.\n|Positive Messages|: The film attempts to convey some messages about the importance of family and being who you are, but they're definitely secondary to all of the crude jokes. Two characters dress in Nazi and Ku Klux Klan uniforms to scare prospective home buyers away from a property. A supporting character commits adultery. A rap song notes that when out of gas, one should \"call the A-rabs.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Dale and Brennan are completely the opposite of what anyone would refer to as role models. They are vulgar, foolish, inactive, and unmotivated-- and that is before they meet each other. Together they terrorize their parents, the neighborhood, and the job market. While there is a half-hearted message about being who you are this is drowned by the film's ridiculous antics. In short, Dale and Brennan are hilarious to watch, but awful to emulate.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Wrestling, scuffling, and tussling; a character knocks another character out; characters are hurled down stairs; a character strikes another in the head with a shovel; two adults fight a playground full of younger children. Children bully grown-up characters into licking dog droppings. Characters watch an action-packed movie.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Underwear-clad making out; kissing; upright, clothed comedic sex in a bathroom; implied masturbation; pornography is glimpsed and referenced; a character drapes his testicles (visible on-screen) on another character's property; constant sexual references.\n|Language|: Constant, crude, and rude language including (but not limited to) \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"balls,\" \"nutsack,\" \"horses--t,\" \"motherf---er,\" \"p---y,\" \"wiener,\" \"chest pubes,\" \"ball 'fro,\" \"big joint,\" \"man-gina,\" \"sucks ass,\" \"bang,\" \"retard,\" \"whore,\" \"gay,\" \"butthole,\" \"dogs--t,\" \"vagina,\" \"douche,\" \"penis,\" \"butt buddy,\" \"fart,\" \"hos,\" and \"faggot.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Extensive mention and onscreen presence of lots of brands and TV shows and movies, including Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Heinz ketchup, Converse sneakers, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Belkin movers, Pet Smart, Outback Steak House, Hustler Magazine, The Cheesecake Factory, Hulk Hands toys, Sony Vaio, Doritos, Good Housekeeping, The Outsiders, Scarface, Good Will Hunting, Rock of Love, The Apprentice, Star Wars, Guitar Hero, \"Shark Week,\" American Idol, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters refer to \"smoking pot\" and \"smoking a jay\" characters drink hard alcohol to excess; characters drink wine.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768338718ba001e314152": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/step-up", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Step Up contains references to gang violence, racial unrest, and tragedies resulting from a life of poverty.

Like the other Step Up movies, there's a little bit of romance and a whole lot of over-the-top dance sequences. Most audiences by now understand that these movies aren't known for their performances or plot lines but for the dancing; this one has the added bonus of featuring some fan favorites from the past few films. This franchise targets tweens and teens, particularly those interested in hip-hop and dance crews.

A character attempts suicide, and suicide is discussed. A woman swims topless, with a breast semi-visible in an underwater shot. Characters kiss and undress each other; a woman is seen in her underwear. Language is quite strong, with frequent uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and other words; supporting characters also make racist remarks. People smoke cigarettes, and Bill is said to be sober, having once had an alcohol dependency. Loosely inspired by the true story of Amanda Knox, this is a meticulous, detailed, slow-burn movie that goes much deeper than its plot synopsis suggests; it's dark, but quite thoughtful and powerful.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie is mainly about making hard choices to help one person at others' expense. The choice comes at a high price, and the price is paid, but the movie indicates that there was no other course of action for these characters; they would have made the same choices again.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bill Baker faces danger and difficult odds to free his daughter from prison; he stops at nothing in pursuit of his goal, even sacrificing his own happiness and possibly his own freedom. At the same time, he offers a portrait of the most stubborn, bullheaded, and marginally rude qualities drawn from stereotypes about people from the United States. He's sometimes kind and helpful, but other times he makes poor choices and acts brashly.

There's plenty of peril: A large pack of wolves pursues key characters and threatens to eat them, a giant machine wreaks destruction, babies drop from great heights, jet packs go haywire, a homemade flying machine crashes at the precipice of a glacier, etc. But the suspenseful scenes are almost always resolved safely. The question of where babies come from is answered in a way that might confuse younger children (be prepared for questions afterward -- or during!). One main character is an orphan who's longed to find her family her whole life; at one point, her dear friend is upset when she talks about finding her \"real family.\" There's a little bit of language (\"butt,\" \"heck\"), some bodily function humor, and a couple of wink-wink moments between adult characters. Corporate greed and insensitivity are raised (and portrayed negatively), but overall, this is a clever, action-packed comedy with messages about teamwork, perseverance, and compassion.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate; perpetuates the tale that babies are delivered by storks.\n|Positive Messages|: Family and relationships are essential to happiness; cutting yourself off from love and affection leads to unhappiness. Childhood is short, and parents should spend as much time with their children as they can. Take your job and responsibilities seriously, no matter what obstacles crop up -- persevere and \"always deliver.\" Corporate greed/insensitivity is portrayed negatively, as is rising up the ranks without a reason/purpose.\n|Positive Role Models|: Junior and Tulip are responsible, warm caretakers for a baby; they also persevere in the face of challenges and end up realizing they work better together, as a team, than apart. Tulip is very compassionate -- as well as creative (even if it doesn't always work out the way she wants). Nate's parents ignore him in favor of their work, then wise up and spend time with their boy (he does manipulate them a little -- i.e. pushing his mom's buttons by saying \"dads are fun, moms are mean\" -- but it's understandable given his situation). A stork becomes attached to a baby who's set for delivery, then loses the delivery address -- but he never gives up on finding her family. Hunter is a calculating businessman who cares only about profits. Montage of happy parents cuddling babies includes many diverse families.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent suspense and peril. Climax includes danger and destruction courtesy of a large machine, as well as the implied death of one character. A large pack of wolves doggedly (and creatively) pursues the main characters and threatens to eat them, including a baby; they're growly and somewhat menacing (especially at first), but they're also portrayed in a humorous way. Babies drop from great heights but are caught. Jet packs go haywire and cause a fire; a homemade flying machine crashes at the precipice of a glacier and has other falls/episodes. One stork is initially portrayed in a creepy/stalker-y way. A stork gets his wing caught in gears and injures it. One character repeatedly hits another to entertain a baby. A bird runs repeatedly into glass panes. Birds stab each other with forks during a fight (no blood). Characters also argue with and yell at each other.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Adults laugh knowingly about how babies are made now that storks no longer deliver them.

Also, the child-like characters many parents remember from childhood have been transformed into fashion-conscious, hair-flipping entrepreneurs, and may contribute to the tweenification of young girls.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, determination, friendship, believing in oneself, hard work, forgiveness -- all these noble messages are woven through the movie. But sometimes the emphasis on these positive messages leaves out the less pretty feelings that kids have. For example, even though Mr. Longface misled the girls on a long, treacherous journey, the girls don't get upset with him. Sure, forgiveness is a good thing, but it's also important to teach kids that it's OK to feel mad and tell people how you feel.\n|Positive Role Models|: The intention is to show girls engaging in positive behaviors, like being helpful and supportive to one another. The movie is peppered with achievements -- designing a new berry juice fountain, using clues in nature to get the group un-lost, taking calculated risks for the greater good -- but all these things are counter-balanced by girly stereotypes. Their vocations involve food, hair, clothes, and dance. They constantly doubt their abilities until a friend urges them on. And their bodies are huge heads upon tiny little frames, which, while not sexualized like Bratz, portray unnatural and uniform body types.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few mildly tense moments, like when Strawberry and her friends rescue Mr. Longface, who has fallen over a ledge.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some might consider the movie to be an hour-long commercial for the dolls and accessories in the Strawberry Shortcake brand.

B. White book about a kindly couple who adopt a sweet mouse who faces danger from the house cat and his feline friends, as well as a pair of duplicitous mice, as he tries to get accustomed to his new life. While on the whole this is a sweet movie, there are some moments of iffy humor, including cat flatulence and a cat joking about licking himself. There is more profanity than you would think for a family movie: \"damn\" and \"hell\" plus plenty of mild mean words and phrases such as \"shut up\" and \"loser.\" There are also some moments of peril, as Stuart is in constant danger from the cats who do not want to accept him as being part of his adoptive family. In fact, cat lovers might take exception to the movie's depiction of cats as being little more than selfish and hateful murderers, even as the house cat finds some bit of redemption later in the movie. As the movie addresses the issue of adoption and the emotional transitions parents and kids face, adoptive and foster families may want to think carefully about whether the themes will be upsetting or reassuring to their children.\n|Educational Value|: May inspire kids to read the book this movie is based on.\n|Positive Messages|: Talk of the true definition of family.

The fact that some of the animated creatures seem very real (particularly a predatory falcon) heightens the intensity and may frighten the youngest kids. Stuart Little, the mouse hero of the movie, his bird friend Margalo, and Snowball the cat are often in jeopardy (multiple falls, chases, captures, threats), though no one is seriously injured except the villain whose evil behavior results in a very violent, yet still cartoonish, demise. There are a few instances of mild potty language (\"poop,\" \"tinky\"). A film clip from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo contains the only romantic scene, with a long, passionate kiss.\n|Educational Value|: Meant primarily to entertain and rich with positive messages, the film also includes wonderful visuals of New York City with its landmarks, its beauty, and its diversity.\n|Positive Messages|: Filled with life lessons: \"You can look at any situation -- no matter how bleak -- and still see a silver lining\"; \"Life is an adventure\"; and \"You\u2019re as big as you feel.\" The film also delivers relevant, in-depth messages about lying, about breaking promises, and the conflicts that often accompany both.\n|Positive Role Models|: With parents that are generous, honorable, loving, steadfast, and trusting, Stuart has developed strong values. He has an open heart, a resilient spirit, and a contagious enthusiasm for life. Other than an evil falcon, each character who makes a mistake learns a valuable lesson and is forgiven. George has an African-American best friend. Two stereotypes appear briefly: an Indian cab driver and the owner of a Chinese restaurant.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Filled with pratfalls, heart-racing cartoon suspense and comic violence. Incidents include: a wild runaway toy plane with Stuart at the wheel; Stuart precariously lowered into a dark sink drain; Snowball the Cat thrown into a dumpster and later falling from a rooftop. The predatory falcon causes no end of mayhem: chasing the smaller, more vulnerable animals, grabbing them with his sharp talons, swooping and threatening the female bird in numerous scenes. He meets a ghastly end, smashing through glass, careening into a plane and falling to what must be certain death.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A film clip from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo shows a man and woman sharing a lengthy passionate kiss.\n|Language|: Very mild potty language in a few scenes: \"poop,\" \"tinky.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Handi-Wipes (in dialogue), Bell Atlantic, Mobil Oil, Purdy Painting Tools.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b32fb0d55001f55f7b6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/suicide-squad", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Suicide Squad is a super(anti)hero adventure based on characters who tie in to the DC movie-verse, like Batman v. Superman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League. This particular story follows a group of shady meta-humans and anti-heroes -- including Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn -- who are forced to team up for the greater good. Expect lots of action violence, from close-up execution-style murders to large-scale battles and widespread destruction that leads to the deaths of innocent bystanders. Characters die or are presumed killed. Language includes swearing (\"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch\") and sexist jokes/insults about men needing to control their women (i.e. \"what they say\" about \"crazy\" women). There's also a man who hits a woman because she \"had a mouth on her.\" There's some sex and romance here, too, with several passionate kisses, mentions of characters sleeping together, and shots of Harley dancing in a sultry way and dressed in very small, tight, revealing outfits. While there's plenty of iffy stuff, ultimately the group dynamic does hinge on teamwork, collaboration, and trying to do the right thing.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid plenty of iffy stuff, there's a sense of \"honor among thieves\" and the idea that even the most hardened criminals can feel remorse, do the right thing, and help others, despite their reputation for being self-serving violent criminals. Deadshot's storyline is about the unconditional love between parent and child, and Diablo's story demonstrates the power of remorse and redemption. On the downside, sexist jokes/insults about men needing to control their women.\n|Positive Role Models|: There are few role models in the movie, but at least Deadshot fiercely loves his daughter. Plus, Flag wants to save June from the clutches of the Enchantress, and the crew (mostly) agrees to fight even when they're not being forced to do so.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of violence: people are assassinated/executed, shot, and killed instantly by both human and supernatural characters. Fights include a wide range of weapons, from boomerangs and baseball bats to military-grade explosives and automatic guns. Diablo sets fire to people and recalls losing control in a devastating tragedy. Characters die or are presumed killed.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several passionate kisses between both Harley and the Joker and June and Flag. Harley dances on a pole and in a club, acts and dresses seductively, and is all about sex appeal. Flag mentions he was sleeping with a witch; Boomerang comments that \"you know what they say about the crazy ones.\" The Joker asks an associate if he \"wants\" Harley.\n|Language|: Several uses of \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"p---y,\" \"d--k,\" \"balls,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" \"crap,\" and more.

It's vulgar, extremely gory, and irreverent, but it's also exhilarating and it has a lot of heart, as well as clear themes of teamwork. This movie is notably more graphic than the 2016 film: Expect intense blood and gore (bodies are slashed, blown apart, etc.), lots of death (including important characters), heavy weaponry, brutal fighting, torture, crashes/explosions, and more, all with an over-the-top, quasi-humorous, comic book style. Language is also very strong, with uses of \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"t-ts,\" \"p---y,\" and much more. Characters have comically energetic (but not explicit) sex, wrecking the room and crashing objects to the floor. Nudity is mostly in the background but includes glimpses of breasts, chests, and a penis. There's some sex-related dialogue and sexual gestures. Main characters smoke and drink, and a character is seen shooting heroin. Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, and many more familiar faces co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid largely consequence-free violence, some deaths are shown to have meaning; deceased characters are missed, mourned. Teamwork is on display, as is prioritizing doing the right thing over following orders. Redemption is possible, even for villains. A character argues about the need to fight for peace at \"any cost\" (including loss of innocent lives), which is a complicated topic.\n|Positive Role Models|: The characters, who've all been convicted of crimes, start out behaving selfishly; they kill frequently and with little consequence. But  they eventually show better qualities and move toward a kind of redemption. They start working together well, even care about each other. They risk their lives to do the right thing and save innocent lives. Most of the large cast are White men, but the three most important characters are a Black man (Bloodsport) and two strong women (Harley and Ratcatcher), the latter of whom is said to be from Portugal. Less positive: A Black female commander is portrayed as ruthless, willing to risk lives of anyone to achieve her (possibly nefarious?) goals.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Extremely graphic, over-the-top comic book-style violence, with blood and gore, death, explosions, brutal killings, etc. Many, many guns, including enormous super-rifles. Lots of people die, including important characters. Characters are shot, stabbed, sliced to pieces (heads, arms cut off). Heads and bodies get ripped in half or blown apart, with huge blood and gore spatters, puddles of blood. Arrow shot into a character's eye. Characters eaten by King Shark. Fighting, with brutal punching, slamming, hitting with hard objects, choking. Woman tortured with cattle prod. One character strangles another with her legs. Character kills tons of guards with a javelin. Characters on fire. Enslaved people are shown in cages, being experimented on in a lab (bodies sliced in half, face torn off, etc.). Crashing vehicles with explosions. Exploding, collapsing building. Rampaging giant monster, with massive destruction. Bird killed with rubber ball; cage full of birds set on fire (sound of birds shrieking).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two characters have energetic sex; they're shown slamming around room, knocking things over, crashing stuff to the floor.

Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, the pilot of the 2009's \"Miracle on the Hudson\" emergency water landing. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie's themes include teamwork, compassion, and courage. It also has some swearing (\"s--t,\" \"ass\"), mostly said in tense circumstances, as well as one \"f--king\" in regards to the weather. Violence isn't graphic but does include frightening, tense scenes of the landing, with passengers screaming, panicking, and more. There are also a couple of post-traumatic nightmares in which Sully envisions crashing into NYC buildings instead of safely in the Hudson (these disturbing scenes could remind some viewers of 9/11). A bar that names a drink after Sully has some over-served/drunk patrons.\n|Positive Messages|: The story is an exploration of courage under fire -- staying calm under unthinkably difficult crises -- and showing compassion to those in need. Also celebrates the teamwork between Sully and Skiles and highlights selfless acts to help others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sully stays calm and responsive while the emergency unfolds. He doesn't panic, and he enlists Skiles' help to analyze the situation and make the only decision that offers the potential safety of his passengers.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Planes crash into buildings, both in Sully's nightmare and in computer simulations (the former could remind some viewers of 9/11, prompting discomort/unease). The actual emergency landing is frightening and tense, with passengers (including babies) crying, screaming, and panicking. Even knowing the outcome, the scene is harrowing. A flight attendant injures her foot and bleeds. The passengers panic as some land in the freezing water and scramble onto rafts. Two passengers land in the water and look on the verge of hypothermia/drowning before being rescued.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A make-up artist gives Sully a kiss on the cheek and tells him it's from her mother \"who's single.\"\n|Language|: Occasional use of \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"asses,\" generally used in life-and-death situations, as well as \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" and one \"f--king\" said in reference to New York's cold weather.\n|Products & Purchases|: U.S. Airways is highlighted throughout the movie.

Heralded as an instant-classic teen comedy on the level of Dazed and Confused or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, it seems destined to be a hit. But parents should know that, like many real teenagers, the characters are obsessed with losing their virginity and talking about sex. Sex and, to a lesser extent, booze fuel every conversation, with very graphic dialogue about genitalia, sex acts, and pornography. \"F--k\" (and many derivations thereof) is used almost nonstop, and there's also a lot of underage drinking and a scene of adults smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine. American Pie seems PG-rated by comparison.\n|Positive Messages|: The underlying message could seem to be that scoring alcohol for a party will grant even the nerdiest kid \"cool\" status for a night. But by the end of the film, it's clear that the film's real point is that true best friends love each other unconditionally, not selfishly.\n|Positive Role Models|: Despite strong, unconditional friendships, the characters in this movie are too lost in their own adolescent angst and insecurity to be considered role models.\n|Violence & Scariness|: McLovin gets pistol-whipped in the head by a robber; a fight breaks out at a party, where a few of the men suffer bloody wounds; a hobo kicks, punches, and pounds on various people at a bar; Seth accidentally punches Jules in the eye. In a daydream, Seth envisions a security guard slashing his throat. A woman's menstrual blood ends up on Seth's pants, causing a fight.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Sex (and various sex acts), virginity, and pornography are discussed in graphic detail throughout the entire movie. The near-constant conversation about oral sex and genitalia is finally matched by two short scenes of drunk, semi-clothed teenagers about to have sex -- although neither couple finalizes the act. There's also a scene that displays many drawings of penises, supposedly done by an 8-year-old.\n|Language|: The dialogue is filled with nearly ubiquitous curse words, primarily the \"F-bomb\" and its derivatives. There are probably two short conversations in the entire film that don't feature constant swearing; otherwise, they're the most commonly used words -- including \"s--t,\" \"dick,\" \"p---y,\" \"ass,\" \"tits,\" \"bitch,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Old Milwaukee beer, plus other liquor brands that sound familiar but aren't real, probably because real alcohol companies didn't give permission to be used in a movie about underage drinking.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The plot revolves around buying alcohol for a high school party, so there's obviously a great deal of underage drinking. Teens also smoke cigarettes and are present at a party where adults are smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine. The main drug, of course, is alcohol -- from vodka to beer.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77704631d95e001f19d937": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/superintelligence", "cs_age": 10, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 10+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Superintelligence is a comedy about a sophisticated, all-powerful artificial intelligence (AI) system that chooses a perfectly \"average\" woman, Carol Peters (Melissa McCarthy), to test as an example of whether humanity should be saved, enslaved, or destroyed.

Iffy language is minimal (\"what the hell,\" \"Badunkadunk\"), but there's some drinking and an implied love scene (silhouettes shown through closed blinds), as well as kissing.

Ultimately, though, the movie has themes of empathy, compassion, and gratitude.\n|Positive Messages|: Highlights how people are capable of empathy, compassion, gratitude, and selflessness.

Many characters are in peril before the hero saves the day, including a school bus full of kids teetering off the Golden Gate Bridge, two coasts threatened by a missile launch, and reporter/love interest Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), who gets in plenty of tight spots. Despite the fact that Superman (Christopher Reeve) has to save her from helicopter crashes, muggers, and earthquakes (she's buried alive in an intense sequence), she still has some take-charge flair. On the other hand, Superman can't save his adopted dad from a heart attack and is shown mourning his death. There's some smoking in the Daily Planet newsroom (typical for the era) and a few swear words along the lines of \"damn\" and \"hell.\" But Superman always fights for \"truth, justice, and the American way\" and will entrance tweens, teens, and parents flying high on nostalgia.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will see the Hoover Dam and the workings of a press room in the '70s -- typewriters and all!\n|Positive Messages|: Like every superhero movie, good against evil is a key component.

Clark Kent intercepts a bullet intended for Lois by a mugger who accosts the two of them. The citizens of Krypton are killed when their planet explodes. Various people are imperiled during an earthquake, including Jimmy Olsen, but all are saved by Superman.

Although they'll be repelled by the primitive-looking special effects, preteens respond well to the flippant humor and fast pace. They're also able to comprehend Superman's \"sacrifice\" for love. Teen and older viewers enjoy the movie's irreverent attitude towards many hallmarks of the Man of Steel mythos, while also appreciating the \"date\" between Lois and Clark. This film does, however, deal with mature themes of world domination, crime, love, heroism, sacrifice. There is some cursing, including \"s--t\" and \"bitch.\"\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Good and bad are clearly defined. Superman wins the day by lying to Lex Luthor and the Kryptonian supervillains (knowing that Luthor's pledge to not reveal a secret was, in itself, a lie). Some underlying messages about love and relationships weakening a man, but this is not explicit.\n|Positive Role Models|: Superman is the ultimate superhero role model -- sacrificing himself for the greater good.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lois is nearly crushed to death. Superman undergoes a creepy-looking change (with muscles and skeleton visible) when he sacrifices his powers for Lois. Younger viewers might be disturbed when the powerless Clark Kent is bested by a roadside bully, resulting in a bloody nose. Superman has several encounters with villains, the most notable being his battle with the trio from Krypton, which leaves much of Metropolis destroyed. Not many casualties are viewed, with the exception of a snake who is burnt, and a little boy who receives the same treatment (offscreen) for trying to warn authorities about the trio's threat.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lois and Clark consummate their relationship, but it's discreetly depicted.\n|Language|: Some cursing: \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"s--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776833103a2d001f5671b4": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/superman-iii", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman is as much of the main character in this movie as Superman. Therefore, expect some of the \"loveable\" con-artist antics that made Pryor famous in his R-rated films, including drunkenness, theft, avoiding honest work, and even letting a swear word slip out. It's all suitably rendered PG-mild, though.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's scene-stealing guest star, Richard Pryor is thieving and helping the bad guys one minute, admiring and helping Superman the next. Rendered \"sick\" by imperfectly synthesized kryptonite, a surly, evil Superman commits mischief, vandalism, and causes an oil slick. There's a clear victory for the \"good\" half of his personality, though.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Strenuous fighting between super-beings, but no blood. Missiles and lighting bolts are repeatedly fired at Superman. Jimmy Olsen falls, suffers a fracture. One character is turned into a Borg-like cyborg, but reverts to normal.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A villain's girlfriend/mistress is usually in tight, revealing clothing. Superman, slightly warped by Kryptonite, spends the night with her.\n|Language|: A few curse words.\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise. Lots of product labels appear, including Kentucky Fried Chicken. An attack on Superman literally turns into a vintage Atari video game.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The `evil' Superman gets drunk right in front of the shocked citizens of Metropolis. Another character, described as a washed-up high-school athlete, is perpetually sloshed and hostile. In both cases, these activities are disapproved of.

Although there's no bloodshed, the violence looks real as the Robinsons do battle with a wide array of animals (sharks, tigers, snakes, etc.), as well as pirates. The pirates who attack the family appear as Asian stereotypes. A teen girl is stereotyped as a helpless damsel unable to survive in the wild without the help of the teen boys. The Robinsons fight, kill, and injure the pirates with swords, rifles, and a variety of improvised defenses such as homemade grenades, explosives, rocks, logs, and a pit occupied by a tiger. Animal lovers will dislike the way the youngest child captures wild animals to keep for himself. The teen brothers joke that by the time they get off the island, they won't care what age the women they see are.\n|Educational Value|: Teaches kids some fun (if unlikely) survival tips in case they are ever stranded in the wild.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages about simplicity: If you're surrounded by the people who matter the most, material goods are no longer important. Hard work, creativity, and teamwork are also valued. Other themes include perseverance, courage, and gratitude.\n|Positive Role Models|: The Robinsons pull together to make the best of their isolated situation. They're grateful for the things they have, rather than spiteful for the things they've lost. They show imagination and intelligence when helping one another build, hunt, and cook. Some dated Asian stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Pirates attack and threaten; the Robinsons fight back with a variety of homemade weapons. There are sword fights and cannons fired. Although there's no bloodshed, the violence looks real. Pirates fall into a pit occupied by a tiger, are crushed to death by booby-trapped logs rolling down a hill, are shot with rifles, and are killed or injured by makeshift grenades and explosives. Two brothers fuming with jealousy fight over the same girl. The Robinsons fight for survival when wild animals attack: a boa constrictor, a tiger, and sharks.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brothers joke about their desire to see women again -- when openly wondering if there will be girls their age when they finally get to New Guinea, the older brother jokes that by the time they get off the island, \"we won't care what age they are!\" When a teen girl arrives on the scene, the two brothers constantly compete for her attention.

Expect references to what a sperm donor does to collect his specimen behind closed doors, discussions about the insemination process, and visuals of the substance in question (in a cup, of course). There's also some swearing and a fair amount of drinking (one character, in fact, makes a critical decision while sloshed).\n|Positive Messages|: The movie sends the message that while families don't always start traditionally, when love is the foundation, they have a great start. It also says that relationships take work and courage -- if you take a chance, you might just get what you want (although it does seem like one main character gets what he wants despite a big breach of trust).\n|Positive Role Models|: Kassie is a take-charge, take-chances kind of person, and both traits lead her to happiness. Wally has a great heart and is a loyal friend, but he can be neurotic, judgy, and discouraging.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The film's premise revolves around a woman's decision to have a baby on her own via a sperm donor, and there's much discussion about the mechanical aspects of this choice, including what men do to \"collect\" their donation.

But otherwise The Sword in the Stone offers lots of positive lessons about courage, the importance of brains over brawn and fair play, and the power of love.\n|Positive Messages|: Being bullied doesn't necessarily make you a bully. Shows the importance of a good education, and teaches life lessons -- courage, the power of love, and the importance of brains over brawn. Also addresses the importance of fair play in competition.\n|Positive Role Models|: Arthur (Wart) is one of the world's most famous heroes. He goes on to become the great King Arthur of the legendary round-table. Disney does a great job in showing how he got there, and as we all expected to find, Arthur was a good, moral boy from the very beginning.

She's as sweet and down-to-earth as always, but the film's focus on college Greek life includes drinking (one character is applauded for breaking a \"keg stand\" record) and catty \"mean girl\" behavior (hazing, cruel put downs, and more). Characters use words like \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" and \"ho\"; there's some kissing, flirting, and innuendo; and characters obsess about the school's online \"Hot or Not\" list. All of that said, the movie's messages about accepting people for who they are and being yourself are on target for tweens and young teens.\n|Positive Messages|: Lots of \"mean girl\" cattiness and cruelty, particularly during rush (the Kappa sisters are advised to target \"cute pledges\" and avoid \"fat losers\") and when the Kappas haze their new pledges (Rachel submits each girl to a blunt analysis of the flaws in her appearance, strafes pledges with water guns, addresses them as \"skanks,\" etc.). But it's made very clear that everything Rachel does is unacceptable, and the movie's overall message is a positive one -- be true to yourself and accept others for who they are, and you'll be a lot happier in the end. There's also a fair amount of stereotyping; virtually everyone except Sydney fits into a \"type\" (spoiled sorority girl, geeky Star Wars nerd, bulky football player), and student groups are portrayed very one-dimensionally during the student council campaigning scenes. But again, it all ends up being used to reinforce lessons about diversity and tolerance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mostly minor comic falls and tussles. Terrence's experiments are often accompanied with small explosions, and fire occasionally breaks out in the Vortex, but no one gets hurt. Rachel drives her golf cart through a phalanx of marching band students, who tumble to get out of her way. A few screen shots of a first-person shooter video game.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of flirting, with some kissing and talk of \"hotties\" and \"hooking up.\" Spanky is obsessed with women and sex (he's enthralled by Sydney's sports bra, saying \"that thing has touched boobs!\"). Female characters' skimpy tank tops, shorts, sundresses, and bikinis prompt ogling among the guys. A scene in which Sydney eats ice cream with relish (with guys watching eagerly) prompts a comment of \"this is a SO-rority, not a HO-rority.\" The school's \"Hot or Not\" list plays an important role in the plot. Male construction workers wolf-whistle at an attractive woman; Sydney matches them by whistling at cute boys. Sydney's dad attempts to explain the birds and the bees using plumbing supplies.\n|Language|: Not that bad for PG-13, but definitely strong for the younger tweens who love Bynes. \"Bitch\" is used a couple of times, as are \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"ho,\" \"crap,\" \"skanks,\" \"ass,\" \"booty,\" \"whoring,\" \"douche-baggy,\" \"hump,\" \"shut up,\" \"pissed,\" \"screwed,\" and \"loser.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Rachel is obsessed with labels (her \"soothing words\" are Gucci, Prada, Chanel, Armani, etc.), and the Kappa sisters are very materialistic in general (they look down on Sydney for having a plumber as a dad). Brands/products include a Mac laptop, MySpace, cell phones, and a Scooby-Doo nightlight.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: No smoking or drugs, but a fair amount of both visible and implied drinking. During tailgate and fraternity party scenes, many students (most of whom are presumably under 21) are seen holding plastic cups; they're not explicitly beer, but it's implied. One character sets a \"keg stand\" record at the Beta party, earning lots of praise and applause. Some alumni (and possibly students) hold beer bottles at the tailgate, and Sydney and the guys attract people to their booth by offering \"free drinks.\" Tyler mentions having to pick up a keg early in the movie, and the frat house boasts an impressive beer-can wall.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d3147dd6e001f6f0ef6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tag", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Tag is a sometimes-crude comedy based on a true story about lifelong friends (Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Burress) who've been playing a decades-long game of tag. Expect lots of strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" and more), as well as an extended gag about threatened oral sex as a torture tactic. Viewers will also get a glimpse of one character's buttocks. One character smokes a lot of pot (others indulge with him), one is a recovering alcoholic, and most of the others have drinks here and there. There's lots of slapstick violence; big falls and other dangerous things happen with no consequences.\n|Positive Messages|: Under the comic mayhem is a message about importance of keeping childish sense of fun, maintaining friendships over the years.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters aren't humanly flawed, but they're not really positively or negatively portrayed; no one is made out to be extreme in any way, except for one very competitive woman -- but even that's balanced by her also being very supportive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Many extreme pratfalls and \"fights\" among friends (punching each other in the behind, etc.) with no hard feelings.

The themes of revenge, vigilantism, sex and drug trafficking, and international political corruption are too intense for young audiences. Language is moderate (\"s--t,\" \"a--hole\"), but drug use is widespread (though not a lot of actual use is shown on camera), and characters also drink and smoke.\n|Positive Messages|: A father becomes a vigilante to save his endangered daughter. A young woman and her friend disregard common sense in search of a good time abroad. Vigilantism and revenge seem justified.\n|Positive Role Models|: Brian's only redeeming quality is his absolute love for his daughter. This positive aspect of his character is ultimately diluted by the violent means he takes to save her.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Although there's little blood, the violence is relentless for the majority of the movie, and there's a high body count overall. People are tortured, killed, and attacked with guns, knives, explosives, cars, and other weapons (belts, fire extinguishers, you name it). A character is willing to shoot innocent people if it will extract valuable information.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Young women are depicted as pawns in a sex trafficking ring.

A teen girl is shown making out with her boyfriend, with the boyfriend working at the buttons on her dress, but they're interrupted. Another kiss is shown, as well as the girl wearing a bikini. Language is very infrequent but includes about four uses of \"s--t\" (three of them during an intense chase scene).\n|Positive Messages|: Compared to the first movie, Taken 2 has a more anti-revenge stance. The main character takes the law into his own hands, but he's also a supreme problem-solver, using his head and the resources at his disposal.

The main character's ex-wife is kidnapped and tortured, though not extensively or gruesomely. (Potential spoiler alert: The bad guys cut a slit in her throat and hang her upside down so that she'll die slowly, but this gives the hero plenty of time to rescue her.) Other medium-level torture scenes (some in flashback); stabbing with scissors takes place off screen. One villain makes a vague threat of rape in regards to the daughter (\"Your daughter will be abused by so many men, she will be like a piece of meat\").\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Kim is shown making out with her boyfriend on a couch.

There's also lots of swearing (including everything from \"dammit\" to \"motherf--ker\") and drinking; one character is an alcoholic who behaves cruelly when she's drunk and also relies on prescription drugs obtained illegally.

There's a lot of romantic chemistry between them (flirting, gazing, and eventually hand-holding, embracing, and a kiss or two), as well as a couple of creepy scenes in which the youthful-looking Mother Gothel uses her beauty to lure men to do what she wants. Expect some nearly constant cartoon violence -- one character dies, another one nearly dies after being pierced by a knife, and there are plenty of last-minute escapes from arrows, horse-mounted soldiers, fire, etc. Characters are hit on the head with a frying pan and kicked in the head; others hold knives and spears in threatening ways. The movie's messages about girl power and seeing beyond appearances are positive and inspiring; kids will learn that we all have dreams, and we should do everything we can to make them come true.\n|Educational Value|: Kids learn the importance of seeing beyond appearances -- all those \"thugs\" in the pub had sweet, generous dreams \"deep down inside.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Sweet messages about honesty, friendship, looking past appearances, and love. Rapunzel sees past Flynn's reputation as a thief to the brave, kind-hearted man she eventually falls in love with, while Flynn realizes that Rapunzel's naive optimism and curiosity are good and inspiring. She sees the best in people, including him, and that helps him act like the best man he can be. Additional messages of empathy, self-control, and gratitude. Also an empowering message for girls: It's not just the boys who save princesses; princesses can do the rescuing, too.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rapunzel is curious and perpetually optimistic, looking for the good in every situation and person. She feels guilty when she thinks she's broken Mother's rules, she gives everyone a chance, and she inspires those around her to act more righteously. She's kind, loving, and selfless. Mother, on the other hand, is the epitome of selfishness and cruelty -- but it's clear that she's in the wrong. Flynn is a thief, but he makes better choices as the story unfolds and demonstrates integrity.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoonish action violence includes chases, close calls, and a lot of escapes -- evading arrows, steadily rising water, fire, and a big group of the king's soldiers. Characters are hit on the head with a frying pan and kicked in the head. Characters hold knives and spears in threatening ways. Mother comes across as creepy and is mean to Rapunzel; she also tries to kill Flynn (he's pierced with a knife and appears dead). A character falls to her death but sort of vanishes before she hits the ground. Some kids may be disturbed by Mother's transformation and her eventual demise.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Rapunzel and Flynn flirt, exchange longing looks, and eventually hold hands and kiss. Mother uses her youthful appearance to lure men to do her bidding.\n|Language|: Infrequent rude language like \"stupid\" and \"dumb.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Many licensed dolls, books, and toys that are constantly promoted.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Characters go to a restaurant where tough-looking characters are eating and drinking, and one character slurs his speech a bit and acts \"drunk,\" but young kids probably won't pick up on that -- to them it will seem as though he just looks and acts silly.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77686a0ab244002006d527": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tarzan", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Tarzan is a 1999 Disney movie. Several important sympathetic characters die in this film, some off-screen and some onscreen. In separate instances a baby gorilla and Tarzan's parents are killed by a rampaging leopard. Though these incidents occur off-screen, in both cases the aftermath is clear: grieving gorilla parents coming to terms with their loss, and Tarzan's parents' lifeless bodies seen surrounded by bloody paw prints on the floor of their house. There's also a climactic onscreen death of the heroic leader of the gorilla band, shot by a scheming human. There's lots of cartoon action: an escape from a burning ship; the leopard's fierce threat to the animal kingdom in numerous scenes; Tarzan's fight to the death with the leopard; rampaging frightened elephants; and, finally, villainous humans attacking and trapping Tarzan and his gorilla family, resulting in a lengthy final battle.\n|Educational Value|: \n|Positive Messages|: This film shows various species in nature (including humans) being threatened by creatures who appear to be different from themselves. Tarzan knows he\u2019s different from his ape family, but longs to be accepted. \u201cForget what you see,\u201d he is told by his loving gorilla mother, \u201chearts are the same.\u201d Both Tarzan and the patriarch of the gorilla band learn important lessons about acceptance.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tarzan\u2019s gorilla mother is loyal and loving, and exhibits all the traits of good parenting (regardless of species). Tarzan is depicted at various ages as he develops a conscience, worthy values, and courageous loyalty. Despite the fact that the story takes place early in the 20th century and she\u2019s a \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d in several sequences, the female character is a scientist, who is competent, fair-minded, and resourceful.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of cartoon action throughout. A terrified family (mother, father, and the baby who will become Tarzan) escapes from a burning boat. An aggressive, scary leopard kills a baby gorilla (off screen), which is followed by the discovery of Tarzan\u2019s dead parents with bloody leopard paw prints nearby. Tarzan later kills the leopard after an extended fight. Elephants rampage; monkeys charge a young human woman (Jane).  Evil humans use rifles to attack, trap, and cage the gorillas and Tarzan. The gorilla king is shot and killed by the human villain. The final, lengthy physical fight pits Tarzan against the villain, who unwittingly causes his own death, falling from a great height.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A budding romance between Tarzan and Jane ends with a loving kiss.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A man pours glasses of wine for himself and Tarzan.

While this movie never commits to tragedy or loss in the way that Disney movies like Bambi or The Lion King do, the possibilities of losing someone in your family or feeling alienated from a social group are still strongly expressed in this film. One brief sequence includes a gorilla version of 'playing the dozens,' hilariously insulting one another about their appearances.

Without the constraints of network TV, MacFarlane has taken off the gloves and created an extremely vulgar movie, filled with wall-to-wall foul language, racial and ethnic jokes, sexual innuendo and references, some nudity and partly shown sex, and a violent fight scene. Characters drink beer and smoke pot regularly, drink harder alcohol occasionally, and even try cocaine (the negative effects are shown). There are also tons of pop culture references, as well as a few product references, including beer, junk food, and video games. But on the upside, the characters have genuine heart and work hard to become better people.\n|Positive Messages|: Buried beneath all the vulgar humor is a message about the benefits of growing up and becoming responsible -- though not necessarily wildly successful. Ted doesn't necessarily celebrate being rich as it does simply being happy and being with the ones you love.\n|Positive Role Models|: He swears, drinks, and does drugs, but John also learns to be responsible and to \"become a man\" (i.e. a grown up) in order to deserve the woman he loves.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Ted and John have a knock-down, drag-out fist fight, destroying many of the objects in a hotel room. Ted whips John's bare bottom with a radio antenna. In one quick scene, Ted plays the \"knife game\" with a person's fingers, accidentally stabbing him on the hand. A little blood is shown. Other scenes of fighting, slight wounds, and arguing. Jokes about rape.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Heavy, heavy sexual content and innuendo, including a partly-obscured shot of Ted (the teddy bear) having sex with a human woman. The bear flirts with a girl by thrusting up against a cash register and then squirts hand cream on his face. One woman's naked breasts are shown. Part of Mark Wahlberg's naked bottom is shown. The main couple, who have been in a relationship for four years, are seen kissing and caressing each other. A close up of \"Lance Armstrong's bronzed nut.\"\n|Language|: Language is constant, strong, and extremely vulgar. This includes many uses of \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" as well as \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), \"oh my God,\" \"douchebag,\" \"douche,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"motherf---er,\" \"p---y,\" \"t-ts,\" \"c--k,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"bastard,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"goddamn,\" and \"whore.\" There are also many racial and ethnic slurs, as well as extremely crude and off-color jokes about topics like rape.\n|Products & Purchases|: Several products are shown and/or referenced, including Budweiser beer, Michelob beer, Nintendo, PlayStation, Pop 'Ems, Sugar Corn Pops, Pepperidge Farm, Teddy Ruxpin, and more.

Teens cope with personal insecurities and social pressures, and stereotypes (\"geeks,\" \"jocks,\" \"in crowd\") are rampant throughout the story. Girls use their sexuality to hook and manipulate guys (promising sex to maintain their interest, for instance); physical contact includes a steamy make-out scene with kissing and some upper-body fondling. There's a fair amount of salty language (\"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"damn\"), and bullying takes both traditional forms -- like intimidation -- and cyber translations, like emailing compromising pictures to embarrass someone. That said, the movie's messages are overwhelmingly positive, reminding teens of the power of self-confidence, individuality, and standing up against peer pressure.\n|Positive Messages|: A mixed bag. Popularity is achieved through bullying and coercion, and image is everything to the school's social queens, who are treat their classmates with disdain. But they learn that their actions have consequences and start to seek out healthy friendships rather than status relationships when they realize how superficial the social system is. Harsh stereotyping of high-school castes is inevitable, but it underscores the characters' change of heart when it happens. Teens email embarrassing photos of a classmate to the student body.\n|Positive Role Models|: The socialites are terrible role models, and Lisa isn't much better when she succumbs to the popularity bug. But fortunately, most of them learn their lesson in the end, and they influence their peers in a positive way.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A couple of instances of electrocution result in teens' deaths, but there's nothing graphic about the content, which is played for humor. There's some suspense over the fate of Amber's soul when it seems she's headed toward the fiery pits of the afterlife.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teens talk about planning to have sex, and in two cases, girls manipulate boys with the promise of sex at the night's end. A make-out scene gets hot and heavy with kissing and some fondling, and couples kiss in school and at parties. Teens refer to each other as \"hot\" and pass compliments like \"nice butt,\" and most relationships are based on physical attraction. Girls dress in revealing clothes and act provocatively to attract guys.\n|Language|: Multiple variations of \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"frickin'.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A teen mentions asking an adult to buy beer for a party she's throwing.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768308718ba001e3139d3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-ten-commandments", "cs_age": 9, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 9+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that there are potentially nightmare-inducing elements for small children, such as the Ten Plagues (which do not spare children and innocents). While essential parts are faithful to the biblical narrative, much of the late parts of Exodus and Deuteronomy are excised, and much is Hollywood scriptwriters filling in the blanks with romantic-triangle melodrama. Part of the appeal of \"biblical epics\" was that they could get away with depicting some pretty intense (for the time) violence and sensuality, as long as it was in the context of sin and inevitably punished by heaven. This wasn't the worst offender by far -- in fact scenes of debauchery come off as more silly than sexy -- but that's something to keep in mind.\n|Positive Messages|: Being true to yourself -- and eliminating slavery in the process -- is more important than being royalty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Moses is the ultimate Good Guy, played with sterling qualities of manliness, respect, humility, piety, you name it. Even conquered enemies and slaves revere him (there's a hint that his rugged sex appeal has a bit to do with it). Except for conquered Ethiopians and Yul Brynner's pharaoh, everyone looks ethnically more or less Caucasian -- rather than distinctly Middle Eastern or North African.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hebrew slaves are whipped, threatened with death (including an old woman nearly crushed under a stone), and occasionally killed on camera. Moses strangles an Egyptian baddie, and a princess is nearly murdered. Children (in the massacres/deaths of the first born) die off-screen, and a boy's body is shown.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Egyptian and Hebrew glamour-girls in flowing robes. The queen of Egypt refers to \"strumpets.\" When the Hebrews make a golden-calf idol to worship they celebrate with sinful \"lasciviousness\u2026iniquity...adultery\" that translates as a rowdy, sensual revel, with a lot of festive dancing, roughhousing, and writhing around -- it's more silly than steamy.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770c2594b2b001e75121a": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tenet", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Tenet is a spy action movie directed by Christopher Nolan that stars John David Washington as an international secret agent who must save the world from World War III. The film opens with terrorist activity at a concert, and there's a lot of action fighting throughout the film. It's mostly bloodless, but there are guns, shootings, explosions, crashes, and beatings. Domestic abuse and child custody are a big part of the storyline. Strong language is infrequent, so when it comes, it's noticeable: Expect to hear \"f--king bitch,\" \"s--t,\" etc. Characters drink socially (wine, vodka), and a suicide pill makes an appearance. Like many of Nolan's films, Tenet explores the concept of time, and it is complicated: This isn't a movie where you can check your brain at the door. Save time to talk about it afterward, because it's hard to catch all of the information -- often because audio involving key details is muffled by masks, walkie-talkies, etc. But the ultimate message is one about being the hero of your own story, and characters demonstrate teamwork, perseverance, courage, curiosity, integrity, and empathy. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: You are the main character of your own story, and you are capable of more than you know. Demonstration of teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most of the cast are White males, but there are ethnically and gender diverse characters who are smart, calm, brave, curious, skilled. Integrity and perseverance. Lead character acts based on empathy. Primary female character is a victim but finds her strength and has the last word; other female characters also demonstrate power, agency.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of action violence; little blood. Guns and shooting. Car chases. Crashes and fires. Beatings. Domestic abuse and threats. Terrorist takeover and battle scene. Threat of torture explained in graphic terms. Characters are arms dealers, and nuclear weapons are a part of the story.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Infrequent strong language includes \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" and one use of \"f--king.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The villain is a billionaire who uses his money to dominate the world.

Although stars Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are known for previously starring in teen-friendly fare, this is a mature post-college sex comedy that while not graphic in its depiction of sex, is still incredibly risque. There's near-constant strong language (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"pussy,\" \"cock,\" \"dick,\" etc.), and several sex scenes that show sides of breasts, butts, and bare shoulders, and women in bras and panties. The movie's message is that relationships require work, acknowledgement, and commitment.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's main message is that relationships mean being there for someone else when they're going through tough times, not just happy times.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ellie teaches Jason about the nature of relationships and convinces him that some people are worth the emotional risk of falling in love. The guys all realize that being in a relationship doesn't mean they can't be close friends.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mike punches Jason. A secondary character dies.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Lots of discussion of casual sex and a \"hook-up roster\" of women the guys will have sex with but not date seriously.

There's barely a sentence in the entire film (even a wedding ceremony!) that doesn't contain multiple \"f--k\"s and other curse words (\"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" and many more). Sandler's character is perpetually drinking a beer -- even first thing in the morning. There's much debauchery; characters drink until they nearly pass out or throw up, smoke marijuana, and engage in adulterous sexual activity. The sex jokes and scenes are nonstop; everything from masturbation to threesomes to incest to statutory rape is depicted, mentioned, and explored. There's little to redeem this movie, even for older teens.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages in That's My Boy are mostly aimed at adults to be better parents and not completely damage their children's emotional lives. There's also a lesson about truly knowing the person you're going to marry. On the downside, much of the movie's humor is at others' expense and/or gleaned by mocking particular groups (the obese, etc.).\n|Positive Role Models|: The only remotely positive role model is the stripper who convinces Donny to search for his son. And at the very, very end, Donny rises to the occasion, accepts responsibility for how he neglected his son, and acts like a father should. Todd is obviously the product of an extremely dysfunctional situation who still managed to succeed professionally.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mostly comic violence. Donny and Todd get in a few fist-fights, which they usually resolve by hitting their opponent with a bottle to the back of the head. Donny, Todd, and Vanilla Ice anger several different crowds of people who chase them from place to place -- including a convenience store, where the owner is trigger happy and shoots off his gun (again and again). Even a priest punches a couple of people.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Like most of Sandler's lowbrow comedies, That's My Boy has tons of references to sex and several scenes of nudity. Incest, masturbation, erections, penis size (even that of a young boy), semen, oral sex, happy endings -- all are heavily explored in the dialogue. Frequent sex scenes feature everything from an adult teacher and her 13-year-old student to a long sequence about a man masturbating to a photo of an elderly woman to a shot of a brother and sister having sex. Donny's home away from home is a nudie bar where the strippers are topless or wearing just pasties and a thong. Sandler often goes for laughs at the expense of very large people, so there are several shots of naked obese people either as strippers or in other situations. Women are frequently treated as objects.\n|Language|: Barely a sentence of dialogue is free of swearing, usually \"f--k\" and its many derivatives, including \"motherf---er\" and \"brotherf---er.\" Other words are also used liberally, including \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"whore,\" \"d--k,\" \"p---y,\" and many other slang terms for genitals. There are demeaning words and culturally insensitive jokes, as when a woman says \"Chinaman,\" and the East Asian butler and maid are used for laughs. A black priest says \"White people are f---ing crazy.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Many product placements -- mostly beer companies (Rolling Rock, Budweiser, Miller Light, Sam Adams, Busch) and cars (Fiero, Mustang, Cadillac). Also references to/appearances by Groupon, Angry Birds, Axe body spray, Vaseline, Taco Bell, Vaseline, and Newsweek.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Donny literally has a beer in his hand for the majority of the movie. It's a running joke that he drinks beer first thing in the morning, all throughout the day, and even in the shower. He pulls them out of pockets, drawers, and other unexpected places. During the bachelor party, the guys get so drunk they can't even stand. Marijuana is consumed, and a man has white powder on his nose that's obviously supposed to be cocaine. Donny mentions that a bachelor party should have a ton of blow, strippers, and hookers to be fun.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776826999c64001ec2c52c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/theres-something-about-mary", "cs_age": 17, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 17+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that There's Something About Mary is a gross-out movie that features rampant unscrupulous, shocking, and inappropriate behavior to elicit laughs. It's funny stuff for the right crowd of adult comedy aficionados and a well-made movie for the often-maligned genre. Kids will want to see it because of the star power of Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller and its notorious shock value as a Farrelly brothers film. But consider this while you listen to them beg: the film features lots of jokes about male sexual insecurity, including getting caught masturbating (falsely and then really, when Mary finds ejaculate on Ted's ear and mistakes it for hair gel), injuring their genitals, gay male sex, and rape. It also makes light of sociopathic behavior, as one character stalks Mary and all the other men in her life continually deceive her.\n|Positive Messages|: Unscrupulous behavior is rampant and played strictly for laughs. Everyone stalks Mary, violating her privacy, spying on her, and lying to her. Healy lies to Ted about what Mary looks like and Ted lies to Mary about why he's in Florida. Norman pretends to be a disabled architect to attract Mary, and sends Mary anonymous notes lying about her boyfriends to make her break up with them. Healy stalks her, listens to her phone calls and conversations in her home, and caps his teeth to attract Mary. Woogie lies to Ted about who he is and violates a restraining order. He also tries to steal her shoes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters lie, cheat, and steal -- all in the name of humor.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of comic violence, including Warren beating up Ted. Ted gets his penis stuck in his zipper, Healy drugs Magda's dog and then sets it on fire (luckily the dog very much looks like a stuffed replica). Policemen beat Ted's head against a table. Warren catches Ted's lip with a fish hook.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A part of the film's over-the-top comedy comes from crude sexuality behavior including: a shot of an old woman's saggy boobs, constant insinuation that Ted is gay and extensive talk about masturbation. Ted gets his genitals caught in a zipper and is rushed to the hospital. Dom's wife gives him oral sex as he watches TV. Ted is caught in a gay sex raid. Ted masturbates and famously gets his semen stuck on his ear, which Mary unknowingly puts in her hair. Healy and Norman go to a strip club.

And it's not just the passionate kissing and love scenes (men are shown bare chested, women stripping down to their bras and panties) that might be too much for some viewers -- there's also a lot of language (mostly \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch\") and alcohol use, as well as some pot smoking. But for older teens who are ready to start thinking about romance, the movie does pose some thought-provoking (albeit a bit cliched) ideas about how different types of people approach meaningful relationships.\n|Positive Messages|: On the one hand, there's a positive message for young women that they don't have to accept a relationship the way it is and have the power to set higher standards for themselves and their partners. But there's no foolproof \"formula\" for a good relationship, and the advice differs for each couple, leading to so much advice that it could easily overwhelm a teenager new to romantic relationships.\n|Positive Role Models|: Probably the best role model in Think Like a Man is the \"happily married man,\" who's always willing to leave a night out with the guys to return to his wife. He pipes up when he's accused of being henpecked and says he loves his wife and wants to go home. Most of the guys think Steve Harvey is a traitor and then read his book to \"defend themselves\" against their girlfriends' demands for intimacy, conversation, professional ambition, and commitment. The women who stay true to their hearts end up with exactly the kind of man they need and want.\n|Violence & Scariness|: \n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: It's not surprising that a movie about relationships mentions sex (or its many euphemisms) a lot and has several love scenes and making-out shots -- mostly between couples who've recently begun dating. Shirtless men, women in bras and panties or bare-shouldered and legged are regularly shown. In one of the earliest scenes, a shirtless man in bed flees a woman's house after a one-night stand. One guy who's known for womanizing is considered a \"player.\" Mya refuses to have sex for at least 90 days/until her boyfriend says \"I love you.\" Another couple has sex on their first date and then is shown in bed a few more times.\n|Language|: Fairly frequent use of strong language, including \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"p---y,\" \"t-tties,\" \"jackass,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"goddamn,\" \"d--k,\" \"douchebag,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Think Like a Man is in many ways a two-hour commercial for Steve Harvey's book on men and women, especially the first half, when Harvey himself appears many times explaining his various themes and philosophies on relationships. There are also close-ups of three different Mercedes Benz cars, and a Barnes and Noble features prominently in a book-buying sequence. During the basketball games, the guys wear a lot of Nike.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Since most of Think Like a Man takes place at bars or restaurants, there's nearly constant social drinking -- wine, beer, hard liquor, shots, you name it. Jeremy is known for being a pot head, and he and Kristen smoke marijuana once.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77689f7a53e9001e6d4471": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/this-means-war", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that This Means War is a romantic comedy-meets-spy thriller with lots of sexual innuendo, passionate kissing, and action violence (including shooting and some deaths, though nothing particularly graphic). The language includes one use of \"f--k,\" as well as \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" and the like. There's one love scene and several references to sex (including doing it with two guys as a \"tiebreaker\") and many make-out scenes. Although the movie's premise is comical, it can also send the iffy message that lying about who you are can win someone's heart. Note: The movie was initially rated R but was re-rated PG-13 upon appeal.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's ultimate message is that you shouldn't put on an act while you're dating someone. But for most of the movie, both men are using information they've acquired as CIA agents to woo Lauren under false premises. Still, Lauren decides that the only advice she needs isn't \"who's the better guy\" but who makes her the better girl.\n|Positive Role Models|: At first, the guys are willing to back away from Lauren when each realizes that the other is seeing her, too, but then they decide to vie for her affections. The two agents don't play fairly and pretend to be interested in things only because they know Lauren loves them.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action-packed, quickly edited violence. Characters die, but it's not gory -- several are shot in quick succession; another falls off the side of a building. Tuck and FDR threaten a possible informant with a wrench and get into fights during their missions. Explosions, gun shots, hand-to-hand combat, and martial arts moves, but the body count isn't high, and the scenes are so fast paced that you can barely tell who's hurt where.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One love scene (the woman is shown in her bra and panties; the man is shirtless), plus lots of make-out scenes and references to sex -- like when Lauren decides to have a \"sex tiebreaker,\" or her best friend, Trish, discusses who looks like he'd have \"dirty sex.\" Trish also encourages Lauren to talk about the fact that she was a gymnast, because guys like women who are \"flexible\" and can do certain things in bed. A man describes sex as \"entered the premises\"; two best friends swear not to have sex with Lauren but then do it anyway.\n|Language|: One \"f--k\" and several uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"ass,\" \"bitch,\" \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" \"horny pants,\" \"p---y,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"crap,\" \"oh my God,\" \"idiots,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Many shots of Mac computers and various cars, including a Camaro, a Suburban, an Audi, and a BMW.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink socially at various dinners and dates. One character stashes alcohol in a sippy cup and at one point refers to her drink as \"mommy's special milk.\" She also refers to her marital sex appointment as doing it \"with Cheetos and wine.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776834961905001eb93a9c": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/thor", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this comic book-based action movie about the Norse god Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), who's banished to Earth to master his temper and discover his humility, has some fairly intense action/battle scenes. But although characters hit, spear, stab, and blow up their enemies, and weapons are used, the violence isn't particularly bloody or gory. There also isn't much swearing -- \"hell\" is about as forceful as it gets -- or sex (just kisses/flirting), and drinking is limited to some beer consumption. And underlying all of the mayhem, there's even a positive message about finding and learning from your weakness.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's subtext seems to be that \"an eye for an eye\" only ends up with everyone blind. The film also conveys the message that just governance requires wisdom and humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: A king wants to raise a son who's not only strong and courageous but also thoughtful and wise. A brother rates family loyalty very highly, though another struggles with it. And a smart scientist won't compromise her research.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action-packed battle sequences that have characters hitting, slamming, spearing, stabbing, lancing, and blowing up enemies. Much of it is done with special effects, so they're not exactly gory. Still, they're intense. Lots of screaming; a character charges into a top-secret location, tossing and punching those who stand in his way. Guns are drawn.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some kisses. Characters comment on others' physique.\n|Language|: Language is rare -- just a couple of uses of words like \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.

It's much less serious and dark than the previous Thor installments (especially The Dark World); humor/tone-wise, it's a lot more like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. Violence will probably be the main issue for most parents: Characters die (including tons of nameless bad guys), villain Hela can be very scary, and there's more slashing and stabbing than in other Marvel movies, though it's still mostly gore-free and non-graphic. You can also expect plenty of big, explosive comic book-style moments. Language includes \"ass\" and \"s--t,\" as well as adolescent humor-style references to masturbation and orgies. One character drinks a lot, but it's not treated as a serious problem. There's a theme of facing major, traumatic change that will have ripples throughout future Marvel titles and may have an impact on younger viewers; characters also display positive traits including courage and perseverance.\n|Positive Messages|: The expected superhero movie themes of courage and perseverance apply, but not in a heavy-handed way. Characters have to overcome massive internal and external hurdles.\n|Positive Role Models|: Everyone's flawed, but the heroes do face down their demons. One must return to her greatest defeat/trauma, which she's been trying to forget (with the help of millennia of drinking). Thor continues his evolution from arrogant jock prince to worthy king.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Expected/typical big, boomy comic book violence (explosions, battles, etc.), plus a few more up-close/graphic moments as the film veers more into swords-and-sorcery territory (there's more stabbing and impaling than in other Marvel fare). But it's mostly bloodless/non-graphic, though characters (especially hordes of nameless bad guys) do die. Hela can be quite scary.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief nonsexual male rear nudity (Hulk's butt) and brief jokes about masturbation and orgies (nothing is shown or explained).\n|Language|: Use of \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"son of a bitch,\" and \"ass,\" plus references to masturbation and orgies, but nothing explicit/detailed.

The comic book-based action film treads on heavy ground, with moody characters prone to power-hungry moves and rage-filled conquests, and with intense battle scenes involving lots of stabbing, shooting, and punching, but it's not so much bloody as brutal. (Viewers don't, in fact, see a lot of blood.) Expect some occasional swearing (\"hell\" and a few instances of \"s--t\") and some kissing.\n|Positive Messages|: As Thor says, it is better to \"be a good man than a king.\" Also, sometimes the meanest of people can redeem themselves.\n|Positive Role Models|: Thor is principled and true, steadfast in his beliefs, and devoted to the cause of fighting evil.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Loads of explosions, knife fights, and gun fights, though the results aren't gory.

Characters smoke cigarettes and drink socially, and there are references to drinking problems, hangovers, and drug use.\n|Positive Messages|: Though the movie doesn't have any clear messages (it's a mix of emotional states), it does leave viewers with an interesting thought concerning justice and revenge. It will be worth discussing, since the movie poses the question but doesn't answer it. Tackles tough themes/subjects including suicide, murder, cancer, and racism.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though there's a rich, three-dimensional female character at the movie's center, she isn't exactly a role model. She's strong and stands up to challenges, but she's also an extremely flawed human who's prone to acts of violence, outbursts of anger, and thoughts of revenge. There's also a racist character who makes several off-color remarks.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Police assault. A man shoots himself in the head; the resulting bloody mess is shown. A man threatens a woman, grabbing her by the throat. Knife held to throat. Drilling through a thumbnail with a dentist's drill. A character beats people with the butt of a gun.

It boasts positive, diverse superhero representations but also has quite a bit of action violence and salty language. Lydia and Emily demonstrate cunning, courage, and teamwork, and Emily and her daughter are brilliant Black scientists whose inventions will save Chicago. The women get involved in brawls and knock-down fights, many of which include violence in the form of explosions, falls, tasers, and gun shots. People get squeezed to death and electrocuted and fall out of skyscrapers. One of the villains, Laser (Pom Klementieff), could frighten some viewers with her intensity and professed love of killing, and another's eyes turn a menacing red when he gets angry. Lydia flirts with a villain known as The Crab (Jason Bateman), imagines dancing with him, goes out for a romantic date, and goes home with him, where they start undressing each other. Language includes several variations on \"s--t\" and \"ass,\" as well as \"bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"suck,\" \"hell,\" anatomical terms like \"balls,\" \"butt,\" and \"tatas,\" and taunts like \"morons,\" \"loser,\" \"psycho,\" \"idiot,\" \"dork,\" \"wack job,\" and \"nerd.\" A character mouths \"What the f,\" and another stops at \"mother--.\" Ultimately, the movie offers the message that superheroes can come in all shapes, sizes, educational levels, and genders -- and that honesty and integrity win out over lying, cheating, and scaring or hurting people.\n|Positive Messages|: Superheroes can come in all shapes, sizes, educational levels, and genders. Same with villains. Honesty and integrity win out over lying, cheating, purposefully scaring or hurting people. It's worth fighting for important friendships, apologizing when warranted.\n|Positive Role Models|: Emily, Lydia, and Tracy demonstrate courage and teamwork in fighting evildoers in their city. Emily and Tracy are brilliant Black female scientists who repeatedly say \"I'm not a nerd, I'm smart -- there's a difference.\" Emily's grandma shows courage and determination in not leaving her home/longtime neighborhood despite possible danger. The Crab has moral quandaries about doing bad deeds, unlike killers Laser and The King. Lydia's blue-collar, beer-guzzling, hard rock-listening, pro sports-watching character could be seen as stereotypical.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Emily's parents are killed by Miscreants when she's still a little girl; she vows vengeance. She's bullied at school, but Lydia stands up for her, punches out a male classmate. On her way to gaining super strength, adult Lydia undergoes injections, strenuous training, pulled muscles, repeatedly knocks out a male sparring partner. TV newscasts reference violence. Lydia and Emily are shot at and take down robbers at a gas station. Emily uses a high-powered taser to electrocute people. They're chased and fired at by a Miscreant named Laser, who has a thirst for blood and enjoys killing people. The King squeezes people to death, has a violent brawl with Lydia.

She jumps out of a skyscraper window, and her fate is uncertain.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A school-age girl tells a male classmate that he'll have trouble \"getting a lady\" with his bad jokes.

They do quarrel and pull away from each other at times, but inevitably, love wins out. Henry commits some petty crimes (stealing, breaking and entering, cheating) out of necessity due to his condition -- he doesn't shy away from doing these things, but it's clear that he wishes he didn't have to.

A man gets slapped after speaking harshly to a woman.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A couple gets in bed a few times and is shown passionately kissing and caressing each other; they later appear below the sheets with their shoulders bared -- when she gets out of bed, you see her naked from the rear (including buttocks).

Her talent as an inventor and fixer goes against girl stereotypes.

There are some intense chase scenes, a band of Scout Fairies who use high-action warfare to tame and repel predators, some fierce storms and lightning, and trippy graphics when Gruff transforms into a monster. Plus, Tink and Fawn are injured and appear unconscious and hurt. There's also a fair bit of emotional intensity in this film, particularly when friends must separate. Overall it's a testament to curiosity, heart, independence, the power of teamwork, and unlikely friendships, but very young kids may be frightened in a few instances or have questions about loss.\n|Educational Value|: The movie is intended to be entertaining rather than educational, but it does further a pro-science, pro-animal stance.\n|Positive Messages|: Good qualities include curiosity, inquisitiveness, and independence; friendship, loyalty and teamwork; unconditional love; following your heart, but balancing it with your intellect; weighing individual desires against the good of the group; not judging a book by its cover; being willing to change your mind or make things right when your assumptions are proven wrong.\n|Positive Role Models|: Fawn is a big-hearted, rescuing, curious lover of animals; Tink and the other fairies are loyal friends who give each other the benefit of the doubt; Queen Clarion trusts the fairies to do what's right for Pixie Hollow in spite of their individual passions; the Scout Fairies are tough-minded and can jump to conclusions but are willing to admit when they're wrong.

At one point, Tinker Bell says, \"It's great to have friends who will help you out,\" and this is when she realizes how sad she is to have damaged her friendship with Terence. When one of the trolls hurts the other's feelings, he apologizes quickly and they make up. Additional themes include communication, perseverance, and teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Tinker Bell is a pretty good role model with normal flaws. She's industrious, creative, curious, passionate, and courageous. But she's also quick to explode, clumsy because she's often rushed, and tends to blame others. But through the movie, she learns humility and how her actions affect others, and she does her best to make changes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tinker Bell's journey brings her into a dark shipwreck where she sees scary shadows and hears spooky sounds. A big group of rats chase her and her friends in a tense scene that might scare very young kids. The two trolls seem scary at first, and their grotesque appearance might frighten the youngest viewers. Tinker Bell falls out of her balloon at one point, but she's OK.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: While there is nothing overtly sexual in the movie, the female fairies dress in figure-flattering clothing and pose coyly in several scenes, as well as in the marketing materials (like the DVD case).\n|Language|: The trolls call each other names like \"stinky breath\" and \"unibrow\" in a playful manner, until one troll takes it too far and hurts the other's feelings. An apology soothes his feelings quickly.\n|Products & Purchases|: Disney and Tinker Bell are huge brands with merchandise nearly everywhere. There's a line of Pixie Hollow products (dolls, toys, etc.), a website, a video game, a book series, and even a magazine. The DVD contains a booklet of advertising\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776867e6d55c00204126aa": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tiny-toon-adventures-how-i-spent-my-vacation", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that there's exaggerated, comic cartoon action throughout Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation. Characters are flattened (often), chased by villains with treacherous weapons, struck by lightning, involved in head-on collisions, overpowered by a tidal wave, and put through many other absurd physical catastrophes. Though there are no injuries that aren't immediately overcome, the movie isn't recommended for kids who don't yet understand the difference between real and fictional violence. A bit of flirtatiousness and some buxom females add some mild sexuality to the story, and there's some bodily function humor (belching, barfing) in several scenes. This film was released direct-to-video when it was made in 1992 and now is available on DVD.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Good guys generally win; bad guys generally lose.\n|Positive Role Models|: The only adult/parental figures seem well-meaning but irresponsibly clueless. The younger characters are always getting up to mayhem, though they're generally good-hearted.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Continuous cartoon/slapstick violence in the tradition of Warner Brothers Looney Tune adventures. Characters are shot out of a volcano, flattened by a variety of vehicles and machinery, struck by lightning, and chased and threatened by a madman and a woman with an axe. They also plunge over a waterfall, plummet to the ground from vast distances, are engulfed by a tidal wave, and are in danger of becoming the main entree in a tasty meal. Enemies include wild possums, alligators, and a lunatic killer with a chainsaw.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several busty cartoon females. Girl characters are smitten by and flirt with some of the boys. It's all silly, exaggerated, and meant as humor.\n|Language|: One character is called \"Uncle Stinky\" and lives up to the name. An amusement park ride is called \"Happy Go Pukey.\" A character is called \"Fowlmouth,\" but his only epithet is \"Dad Gum.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Plenty of Looney Tunes merchandise exists.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Movie PA announcement: \"No smoking cigarettes in the theater,\" after which a lit cartoon cigarette gets up from his seat and leaves.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d10ad5437001f7cc065": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/titanic", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that James Cameron's King-of-the-World saga Titanic is one of the highest-grossing movies of all time and is still sure to attract young teen and tween audiences. There's brief nudity (a topless Rose poses for a nude drawing, which is also shown throughout the film) and sexuality (Jack and Rose make love in the backseat of a car), but the forbidden romance between the main characters (played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) is otherwise rather chaste by today's standards. It's the epic Titanic sinking scene that may make this movie too intense for younger kids. Throughout the mass chaos, people fight to save themselves ahead of others, plunge to watery deaths, and, in some cases, even die by suicide. Three incidents of gun violence take place during the sinking, with visuals of blood and depiction of suicide with a gun. On the flip side, characters display compassion and humility. The fact that this movie is based on a historical event may be too intense for sensitive children, but mature kids fascinated with the Titanic will find it compelling to watch.\n|Positive Messages|: A person's worth is far greater than the station they were born into. Themes include compassion and humility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jack and Rose transcend societal expectations and fall in love with each other, acting bravely to help save themselves and others. The \"haves\" for the most part -- excepting Molly Brown, the captain, and the ship architect -- aren't the most admirable lot. Many people onboard act selfishly, like Cal, who pretends a small child is his to get a spot on a lifeboat, or the man who refuses to allow his half-filled lifeboat to return to save more people.\n|Diverse Representations|: Minimal racial diversity. Central female characters like Rose and Molly Brown are portrayed as strong, nuanced, and in charge of their own destiny, despite pressures around them to act otherwise. Early 20th century class conflicts are a central theme: Privileges of the wealthy are highlighted and criticized, ending with Rose choosing to be identified as a third-class passenger.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Rose is briefly struck by Cal. Violence and intense peril are concentrated toward the end of the movie, especially as the ship begins to sink: Mass chaos leads to fistfights, pushing, gun violence, even suicide. People plunge to their death in icy waters, some killed by falling debris from the ship. Almost everyone left in the water drowns. Close-ups of passengers who stay on the ship, preferring to await the inevitable in their rooms or lounges.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One scene of a topless woman as she poses for a painting, plus shots of that painting, as well as a few other nude drawings. Jack and Rose flirt, kiss passionately, eventually have sex. The love scene doesn't include any nudity, but the couple is sweaty, out-of-breath, bare-shouldered, on top of each other.\n|Language|: The most commonly used swear is \"s--t,\" repeated several times throughout. Other strong language includes one \"f--k,\" \"horses--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"bloody,\" and several \"goddamns,\" \"oh my Gods,\" and other exclamations, especially toward the end. Insults include \"slut,\" \"whore,\" and \"moron.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: First-class passengers drink wine and champagne with dinner. Men smoke cigars and drink brandy after dinner. Steerage passengers get drunk at a late-night party where beer is plentiful. Jack smokes cigarettes.

Kids might be interested if they're familiar with the story thanks to the animated Balto series. Older viewers might need to feel a special interest for the Alaskan setting, dog-sledding, or the true events of 1925 to be fully engaged by this film. The relationship between man and dog is endearing, especially the way the dog worms his way into the man's heart, scenes that elicit some mild swearing, including \"damn\" and \"Satan.\"\n|Educational Value|: Kids can learn about illnesses that struck children and others before vaccines were widely available, the difficulties of life before modern modes of transportation, and dog-sledding.\n|Positive Messages|: Determination, courage, selflessness, and hard work pay off.\n|Positive Role Models|: Seppala risks his life to save others. He and his wife treat each other with kindness and support. Togo the dog is loyal, persistent, hard-working, and good natured.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Seppala and his sled dogs face life-threatening situations, including traveling in frigid temperatures and blinding snowstorms, nearly sledding off a cliff, and traversing an icy lake that begins cracking and melting under their feet.

Tom and Jerry are in full talk mode in this movie for the first (and only) time. They spend the first few minutes fighting and outwitting one another, with the usual chases, falls, bumps, and explosions. The rest of the film is a joint effort by the beloved characters as they try to rescue and help a young orphaned heiress facing an array of cutthroat villains. Plus, hoping to establish some equity in the musical genre (perhaps in an effort to cash in on some of the Disney magic), the movie has a full score of musical production numbers composed by Henry Mancini and Leslie Bricusse, two well-known songwriters. Though there is some of the expected cartoon mayhem (fire, an avalanche, danger on \"the mean streets\"), the conflict is provided by human scoundrels with evil on their minds. It appears that the film did not achieve the hoped-for success and remains the only Tom and Jerry movie of its kind.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain, not educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes putting aside differences to be helpful to others: \"The greatest gift in life is a friend.\"\n|Positive Role Models|: Tom and Jerry learn that working together as a team reaps rewards. The cat-and-mouse rivalry is played only for a very short time in this film. Instead, they are striving for similar goals and, for the most part, treat each other well and are concerned for one another's well-being. A stereotypically greedy lawyer (\"Lickboot\") is an associate of a one-dimensional evil female guardian. The many villains all are two-faced: initially sweet, compassionate, and caring, but then transformed into mean, money-hungry, will-stop-at-nothing bad guys.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Standard Tom and Jerry cartoon mayhem, only in this case less of it than in other movies. Characters blow up and fall and are chased, squished, squashed, hit with mallets, trapped in a house fire, stuck on a Ferris wheel, and threatened by a fang-bearing, growling dog. In some instances, characters appear to have been drowned, trampled, or exploded but turn up, alive and well, only moments later. \"Stray catchers\" capture and cage some animals.

Like all Tom and Jerry cartoons, you can expect loads of slapstick, cartoonish violence, here with a bit of added creepiness thanks to the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys. But because Tom and Jerry have to band together to rescue Dorothy, there's slightly less antagonism than in their other cartoons -- plus more musical numbers to lighten the mood.\n|Educational Value|: This is for entertainment purposes only, although kids do get a primer on the story of The Wizard of Oz.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's overall message is one of teamwork and collaboration, albeit slightly skewed because of how often Tom and Jerry try to hurt each other. Still, even the antagonistic Tom and Jerry work together to rescue Dorothy and their new pal Tuffy.\n|Positive Role Models|: In addition to Dorothy, the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Lion, Tom, Jerry, and Tuffy are all brave in their quest to find the Wizard and stand up to the Wicked Witch. Despite their differences and ongoing rivalry, Tom and Jerry work together to help Dorothy and their new friends.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys are always creepy, whether live-action or animated. The monkeys grab Dorothy and most of her friends. Tom, Jerry, and the munchkin mouse take a spiked mace, a wrench, a baseball bat, and a pistol as they walk toward the Witch's lair. Tom and Jerry are famous for their cartoonish violence, and the slapstick is in nearly every scene. The duo injures each other (almost always it's Tom who gets hurt) in various ways. Usually Tom is crushed with falling objects, falls off ledges, or gets hit all over his body. In one seat-jumping moment, Tom is swallowed by an alligator. The Witch melts in a much longer death scene.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: Mild colloquialisms like \"ticked off.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Obviously this movie is a way of showcasing many classic MGM/Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters: Tom and Jerry, Spike and Droopy, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f3c68e4fc29001eb6edc8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tom-and-jerry-the-lost-dragon", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon is an original short feature film in which the popular cat and mouse \"frenemies\" function as a team while helping their mistress Athena, a gentle young witch, save a baby dragon from the clutches of a utterly evil adult witch. Drizelda turns on her comic \"seductive\" charm by shaking her rear and bumping and grinding her way through a song. Extensive cartoon jeopardy and action includes fire-breathing dragons, dark magic, lightning strikes, crashes, falls, chases, and many characters being hit over the head, being knocked down and out, and catching fire. As is typical of this franchise, the movie is intended to provide comedy and mild scares to kids who are comfortable with cartoon peril as opposed to real danger.

Drizelda, a witch, wields her dark magic in several scenes: lightning bolts, fire, unleashing a serpent, transforming herself into a dragon. Her cadre of assistants (half-cat, half-bat) chase and menace the heroes. An anxious, scary-looking mother dragon breathes fire toward anyone who threatens her baby. The two dragons fight. A wizard uses his mighty powers to defend against Drizelda. Characters catch fire and plummet long distances, and, in two instances, sympathetic dragons appear to be turned into stone.

Make no mistake, this is a creature feature -- and the monsters are fanged, spiked, and terrifying. And the war violence is intense, with nonstop gunfire/heavy artillery, explosions, and weapons use, though it's all shown in the context of fighting against an invasive species that's literally eating the human race into extinction. A bloody wound is shown, as are blood smears and corpses. A married couple kisses, there's a little drinking, and one scene has a character saying \"s--t\" over and over for comedic purposes (there's also one \"f--k\"). Lead characters are White, but the supporting cast is more diverse. Overall, characters are from all walks of life and make positive contributions with the skills they have -- including women who are assured leaders and kids who love science. Pratt's character, Dan, is ex-military, and the story highlights the value of what he learned in the armed forces.\n|Positive Messages|: To be the best, you have to do what no one else is willing to do. We all deserve a second chance. Teamwork is a clear theme. What you learn in school matters and has a real life application.\n|Positive Role Models|: A veteran is depicted as a hero and a leader. A young girl who's interested in science follows her passion and makes a positive impact in the world. Women are depicted as strong and commanding.

Although it's tween friendly, the movie does contain some startlingly violent action sequences: Robotic villains shoot and kill people in several scenes, instantly disintegrating them -- sometimes disturbingly casually (the body count undermines the movie's otherwise all-ages appeal). Main characters are in near-constant peril; they're shot at, they fall from heights, they get in furious hand-to-hand fights, and more. One significant character appears to die, and another actually does, in a sad scene. Language includes insults like \"idiot\" and \"stupid,\" plus \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and some cut-off phrases like \"son of a!\" While there's no substance use or racy content, there is a whole lot of consumerism, primarily due to the nonstop Disney references (the movie's title and themes were inspired by an area of Disneyland) and the prominent presence of brands like Coke, Pepsi, iPhone, and more. Still, families will appreciate the clearly positive messages about using innovation, invention, and engineering to make the future a brighter, better place.\n|Positive Messages|: Dreamers must stick together, innovators never give up, and knowing how things work can change the world. Inspiration and invention can change the world. Curiosity and persistence are valued; optimism trumps pessimism. Life is made up of two forces (described as \"wolves\"): darkness and despair vs. light and hope -- the winner depends on which one you feed most (i.e. success depends on feeding light and hope).\n|Positive Role Models|: Casey is eternally optimistic and encourages both her father and Frank to think on the bright side and come up with ways to stay positive and hopeful. She breaks lots of rules and runs off without telling her dad, but her choices are all focused on accomplishing something big. Frank starts off as a cynical, suspicious crank, but he redeems himself. Athena is a positive force who believes in the power of her \"special\" recruits. Frank's dad discourages him as a child; Casey's is the opposite.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent explosions, chases, crashes, falls, and peril. Relentless robot soldiers kill several people with guns that disintegrate them; it's startling and happens several times, sometimes disturbingly casually. They also shoot at and try to kill the main characters. Other weapons cause fires/destruction and remove (robot) body parts. In one scene, it seems like a major character has died, but he's saved. But significant characters do die (one is particularly sad), and there's a notable body count as a result of fights/crashes/battles. Some hand-to-hand combat.

Winning is the most important thing to all the pilots, who try to intimidate one another with plenty of posturing and banter -- though when push comes to shove, loyalty and friendship have important roles to play, too. While sexism is noticeable and almost all characters are men, two strong women help keep some of the objectification in check.

While sexism is noticeable, two strong women characters help keep some of the objectification in check. Relatable friendships between men. Even though students compete with each other, they support Maverick after a tragedy.\n|Positive Role Models|: Maverick is overconfident and cool, but he's got some depth to him, too, and he grows/matures somewhat over the course of the story. Charlie is a smart, tough woman. Goose and Viper are supportive friends and mentors to Maverick. Iceman is a great pilot -- eventually winning the Top Gun trophy -- because he's careful and follows rules.\n|Diverse Representations|: All Navy personnel and Top Gun students are men. Two pilots are Black but are mainly in the background of the story.

There's some persistent violence in the form of a frightening older gangster who has no problem killing his own henchman and is responsible for the film's (relatively small) body count. Language includes a couple of uses of \"f--k,\" as well as \"s--t\" and \"a--hole.\" Although sexual content isn't too graphic -- Jolie and Depp's characters kiss passionately a couple of times, and, in one scene, Jolie strips down to her undergarments to change into a nightgown -- there's still a strong feeling of sexuality throughout the movie, as Jolie's mere presence creates an aura of sex appeal.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's strongest message is that everyone is both good and bad, light and dark, and those who love you accept you completely as both.\n|Positive Role Models|: Shaw puts his love of money and possessions above all else. Alexander might have stolen from an awful man, but he's still a thief, and Elise is a rogue character who makes questionable professional and personal decisions.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A kingpin and his gangster henchmen try to kill Frank and Elise several times, chasing them on speed boats and through the streets/rooftops of Venice.

She's presented as being so stunning that men and women stop in their tracks to stare at her as she walks by.

All of the dynamics behind sibling rivalry are here as well, so if your kids are going through that, this is a perfect movie to have them watch together. Kids may be scared by Andy's next-door neighbor Sid, who has a mean laugh and mutilates toys for fun -- but he does get a mild comeuppance. Really young kids may be confused by the toys being \"real\" here, especially when Buzz really thinks he's a star commander.

Toy characters go to great lengths to rescue their friend, demonstrating courage. Both Woody and Buzz learn humility over the course of the film.\n|Positive Role Models|: Two toys are rivals, and one does something cruel out of jealousy, but he works hard to make amends -- and his hard work is rewarded and acknowledged. All the toys show lots of love and loyalty to their owner. A mean neighbor who mutilates toys gets his comeuppance.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some tense/scary scenes with toys in peril. A boy mutilates toys and straps them to rockets. Potentially frightening images of \"mutant\" hybrid toys.

The plot again finds the toys banding together to rescue a fellow toy in peril; the fact that characters are separated from their loved ones could scare or upset the youngest viewers. There are also some tense scenes with characters in danger (though no one gets seriously hurt) and a very poignant sequence involving Jessie the Cowgirl. But there's no sex, strong language, drinking, or other iffy content, and kids who watch will take away positive messages about teamwork, friendship, and loyalty. Note: The 3-D version of the movie includes a couple of brief scenes that might spook the youngest viewers, like the evil Zurg trying to blast Buzz, but otherwise the digital effects are played for laughs (or, as the green squeeze-toy aliens would say, \"Oooh ... aaah\").\n|Educational Value|: No overtly educational content, but kids will learn about the importance of friendship and honesty.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has strong positive themes about loyalty, friendship, courage and teamwork. Characters learn lessons about themselves and others. Strong message about enjoying life's joys.\n|Positive Role Models|: The toy characters once again go to great lengths to rescue a friend in trouble. The movie's villain is clearly motivated by greed and eventually gets his comeuppance. A supporting character betrays one of the main characters due to his own hurts and suspicion -- but this is clearly shown to be wrong. Feisty Jessie is a welcome addition to the gang.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Some tense scenes show the main characters in peril. Some slapstick falls; characters fight/grapple (but no one is seriously hurt). One battle scene turns out to be from a video game. In the 3-D version, a couple of scenes can be briefly scary, like when Buzz's nemesis Zurg is featured.

Overall, the latest adventure shared by Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the rest of Andy's favorite toys is kid-friendly -- but there's a fairly long scene of the toys in serious peril toward the end of the movie that many 3- to 5-year-olds could find quite upsetting. There are also a few new toys that act a bit mean and creepy (particularly a Big Baby doll and a cymbal-clapping Monkey) and scenes in which favorite characters are trapped by cruel authority figures. But there are also wonderful, touching messages about friendship, loyalty, and imagination. Note: The 3-D version of the movie may make certain parts feel more immediate/lifelike, but the movie's intense scenes have a strong impact no matter which version you see.\n|Educational Value|: Kids may learn the value of appreciating and taking good care of their favorite toys.\n|Positive Messages|: Pixar's Toy Story movies are all about friendship, loyalty, and \"being there\" for Andy and for each other. Through teamwork, perserverance, and collaboration, Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex band together to overcome their many obstacles and disagreements. Sharing, curiosity, and ingenuity are all celebrated.\n|Positive Role Models|: Andy's toys are all courageous and willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. Woody is one of the most loyal characters in movie history -- his dedication to Andy above all else is admirable (if sometimes hard for his friends to understand) -- and over the course of the three films truly learns humility. The rest of the toys are also quite brave and helpful, and they don't quit on Buzz when he's not acting like himself. Even the alien \"kids\" are quite willing to do anything and everything to save their \"parents\" Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and friends from danger. Toy Story 3 introduces some new characters who aren't as admirable as Andy's crew, but they face the consequences of their behavior in the end -- and some even get a fresh start.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Spoiler alert: In one particularly harrowing/scary sequence set in a junkyard, Andy's toys narrowly escape death several times; at one point they look like they're about to fall into a very fiery incinerator. It's a tense scene, and some kids will find it upsetting. A few of the Sunnyside toys are creepy -- especially the Big Baby doll and the screeching Monkey. A few scenes meant to suggest prison culture/abuse show toys being tied up or thrown in a sandbox as \"punishment\" -- or, in the case of Buzz, \"reset.\" Some bullying and harsh talk between toys; a few perilous scenes. The opening sequence includes spaceship attacks and a train falling/crashing, but it ends up being the product of Andy's imagination.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting between toy characters like Ken and Barbie (it's love at first sight!) and Buzz Lightyear and Jessie. Some innuendoes (as when Baribe tells Ken that she likes his \"ascot\").\n|Language|: Mild insults like \"shut up\" and \"junk.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Several of the Toy Story characters are recognizable brands (like Barbie, Ken, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Potato Head).

It's remarkably poignant and should appeal to audiences of all ages -- from parents and children to those who grew up loving Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), and the gang. There are also many new characters this time around, starting with Forky (Tony Hale), the sentient arts-and-crafts toy made from a spork, clay, pipe cleaners, and googly eyes. This movie definitely fits into the series' action-comedy genre, but its peril is less intense than the harrowing climactic sequences of Toy Story 3. Still, you can expect lots of high-stakes escapes/rescue missions, some close calls, and very creepy vintage ventriloquist dummies. Most of the film's peril, worry, and violence focus on separation from the toys' new kid, Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw), as well as the slightly sinister machinations of Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), an antique-store doll who's desperate for a new voice box. Gabby's subplot has one of the movie's only less-than-completely-positive messages (it touches on the idea that if you fix what's \"wrong\" with you, you could be more likely to be accepted/find love). But her arc also includes powerful examples of empathy, and overall the film has touching themes of friendship, loyalty, imagination, and the power of play.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but kids will learn value of play time and appreciating toys, whether handmade or purchased.\n|Positive Messages|: Toy Story movies are all about friendship, loyalty, \"being there\" to care for and comfort kids -- plus teamwork, courage, perseverance, empathy, listening to your conscience/\"inner voice.\" Toys work together to overcome obstacles, disagreements. This installment deals with being open-minded (one person's trash can be another person's toy), inclusive, generous (Woody helps Forky because Forky is the favored toy), and learning to find purpose in life. Encourages striking out for new adventure, having an independent spirit. A subplot touches on potentially iffy notion that if you fix what's \"wrong\" with you, you'll be more likely to be accepted/find love.\n|Positive Role Models|: Woody is one of the most loyal characters ever -- his dedication to Andy and now Bonnie is admirable (albeit frustrating for friends and possibly viewers); he has unshakable devotion to fellow toys, not leaving toys behind; he works hard to protect Forky, who is Bonnie's favorite new toy. Forky transforms from confused to determined. Buzz learns to listen to his \"inner voice\" to help guide him and lead the others. Bo Peep is clever, brave, a fabulous problem-solver. She helps Woody and Forky at her own risk. Bunny and Ducky work with their new friends to reunite Bonnie with her lost toys. Even initially creepy Gabby is ultimately revealed to have much more complexity. Bonnie's kindgergarten classroom is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of peril and tense moments during rescues and escapes (big jumps, chases, falls, near misses, etc.). Creepy ventriloquist dummies act as Gabby Gabby's henchmen: They take toys hostage, keep them locked up, etc. Bunny and Ducky consider physically attacking elderly antique store owner (their plans are visualized) and imagine shooting deadly lasers from their eyes (also shown). Much later they actually jump on a character's face, and also brawl with other toys (jumping on Buzz, etc.). Gabby Gabby is initially portrayed as sinister. A store cat is known to demolish toys, even leaving a stuffed toy that's been severed at the waist. In a disturbing moment, the cat swallows a tiny toy (but later spits her out). Bo Peep has a broken arm she keeps bandaged together. Arguments. Early scenes show a storm with thunder. Sad separations between close friends and hurtful rejections. Bonnie is scared to go to kindergarten at first.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting and longing looks between toy characters that culminates in a lingering embrace. Quick joke about a toy's previous fling with He-Man.\n|Language|: \"You're crazy,\" \"he's terrifying,\" \"weirdo,\" \"dummy,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Some of the Toy Story characters are recognizable brands (Barbie, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Potato Head, etc.), and others are mentioned (Chutes and Ladders, etc.).

Toys, action figures, McDonald's Happy Meal gifts, games, books, party supplies, plush dolls, etc. You can even buy (rather than make) your own Forky.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In an imagined scenario, an older woman is shown relaxing in a bubble bath with a glass of red wine.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7769ce594b2b001e6aa798": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/transcendence", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Transcendence stars Johnny Depp as Dr. Will Caster, a brilliant researcher in the field of artificial intelligence who's shot by a band of anti-technology extremists and finds another life within an experimental supercomputer. As the scientist's mind expands into new frontiers, he starts to devise new ways to cure diseases and heal the environment ... but he also pursues his own less-altruistic agenda. This is pretty intense, brooding end-of-the-world material, which is too much for younger viewers. Expect explosions, gunfire, and other action sequences, as well as infrequent swearing (including \"s--t\"), a little kissing, and a few bar scenes with adults drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: Absolute power corrupts, and we need to be careful about how we use technology. While a brilliant scientist/artificial consciousness thinks he's trying to improve the world, it soon becomes clear that he won't tolerate any interference.\n|Positive Role Models|: A woman is willing to do almost anything to save her beloved, dying husband, even if it means transferring his consciousness into a powerful computer network. And when she realizes that her actions have dire, unintended consequences, she's willing to make a huge sacrifice in an attempt to make things right.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes feature soldiers attacking a compound, using machine guns and explosive devices that turn a large field of solar panels into debris. A character is assaulted by two men and then kidnapped. Another man is badly beaten, and his battered and bloody body is shown in detailed close-ups.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A few kisses between a husband and wife.\n|Language|: Occasional use of the word \"s--t.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: One character uses several Apple products, including an iPhone and an iPad.

It's packed with scenes of loud, hectic combat (including gunfire), destruction, and flying missiles and bodies. Plus, it's long (144 minutes, the last 20 or so of which are devoted to a big fight scene), the characters swear (\"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" a couple of incomplete \"f--ks,\" etc.), and there's some sexual imagery (shots of cleavage and a short-skirted bottom, jokes about masturbation and virginity, and more).\n|Positive Messages|: Though you could argue that the movie has some kind of take away involving teamwork and friendship, really it's all just an excuse to blow stuff up. There are some stereotypes -- a Latino character is mocked for his \"magic voodoo powers,\" a computer expert embodies lots of geeky cliches, and a \"black\" robot uses street jargon and gang signs.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sam is mostly a good kid -- though he deceives his parents, he also saves Mikaela from a bad boyfriend (and the world from bad robots). Mikaela has a criminal record and can hotwire cars.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Early attack by alien robots results in fiery explosions and bodies flying; Transformer attack at car dealership (loud noise, car windows blow out); huge battle in the desert (robots vs. Air Force); Transformers attack Sam and Mikaela (lots of chasing, crashing, noise); flashback shows destruction of Transformers' planet; little robot monster with sharp limbs terrorizes humans and infiltrates Air Force One. A lengthy fight scene in city streets ends the film -- more explosions, shooting, missiles, and bodies. At one point, the villain transforms into a plane and flies into a skyscraper -- images that will remind many viewers of 9/11.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Mikaela wears a cleavage-showing midriff top; bikini girl posters in Sam's bedroom; Miles calls Mikaela \"the evil jock's concubine\"; Miles reminds Sam that it's \"bros before hos\"; song \"Sexual Healing\" on car radio; close-ups of Mikaela's sweaty belly from Sam's POV; Sam says \"I'm cool with females working on my engine\"; Sam says he keeps a magazine called Busty Beauties under his bed; Glen admits he's still a virgin (this appears to be a joke at his expense); following a noise in his room, Sam's mom asks him \"Were you masturbating?\"; Sam's online user name is \"Ladiesman217.\"\n|Language|: In addition to a couple of incomplete \"f--ks,\" the language includes \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"bitch,\" \"s--t\" (multiple uses), \"ass,\" \"crackhead,\" \"frigggin',\" \"hell,\" and a spelled-out \"bee-otch\" on Sam's car freshener.\n|Products & Purchases|: The entire film is virtually a commercial for Hasbro toys (the company is listed as both a production company and the maker of Transformers action figures). There are also visual or verbal references to Mac laptop, eBay, Camaro, Austin Healey, Porsche, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Volkswagen, music acts (50 Cent, Garbage, The Strokes, Rage Against the Machine), the Redskins, Armageddon, Ding Dongs, Taco Bell, Nokia, Mountain Dew, Star Trek, and GM vehicles (most of the Autobots are modeled on GM cars).

The dialogue is peppered with strong language, mostly \"s--t\" or \"ass,\" but there's also the occasional \"a--hole\" and one use of \"f--k.\" As for sex, while there's only one big kiss, more problematic is the movie's pervasive objectification of women, with nearly all of the female characters wearing tight, revealing clothes. Families sensitive to racial stereotypes may not appreciate the way some of the Autobots talk or how, in one scene, it's implied that all Chinese people are magically experts at martial arts. Despite all its many iffy elements (and the nearly three-hour runtime), this film will appeal to teen boys who enjoy action flicks. While younger kids may be interested, especially if they play with the Hasbro toys, this series is best for older kids who can handle the non-stop chaos and massive destruction.\n|Positive Messages|: The moral of the story is that unchecked technology and innovation can sometimes lead to corruption, greed, and dangerous developments. And there are underlying themes of loyalty and fighting for what's right. But they're frequently overwhelmed by the fact that violence is used to settle all conflicts, as well as a few negative stereotypes and jokes. And while the father in the story rightly believes it's his duty to protect his daughter, he also thinks she needs another protector (in the form of her boyfriend) rather than believing she can defend herself.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cade is a devoted father to Tessa. And Tessa and Shane, despite keeping their relationship a secret, are supportive of each other and help Cade. But the movie also pervasively objectifies women, and there are some stereotypes, both in the way some of the Autobots talk and in the implication that all Chinese people are magically experts at martial arts.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This franchise is full of violence, but it's not usually gory, and the same is true here -- with one notable exception: A man is incinerated and is shown dead, mid-stride, completely burnt. And, of course, there's tons of loud, explosive action between the remaining Autobots and Lockdown, the evil Decepticon bounty hunter. There are also human vs. Transformer battle sequences, as well as human vs. human fights. Many people and Transformers die, as well as countless civilians via scenes of mass destruction.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Less overt sexual innuendo than in previous installments, but still many shots of scantily clad women (particularly Tessa, whose father chides her for wearing too-short shorts/skirts/cleavage-baring tops), and nearly every female character in the movie is objectified and unnecessarily sexualized. There's a conversation about Tessa and Shane's relationship being covered by the \"Romeo and Juliet law,\" which means sexual contact between a minor and a legal adult began when both parties were under 18. Shane makes a joke to Cade about wanting fresh breath when \"making out with your daughter.\" One big kiss.\n|Language|: Frequent use of \"s--t,\" and occasional use of \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" a bleeped-out \"f--k,\" and a singular \"f--k\" (in the phrase \"Get the f--k out of the way\").\n|Products & Purchases|: The entire franchise is based on Hasbro toys, which are popular with/marketed to kids who aren't old enough to see the movie. There are also many product placements within the movie, from General Motors cars (Chevrolet, Dodge, Cadillac, etc.) to imported cars (Lamborghini, Pagani, Range Rover, Mini Cooper, Rolls Royce) and drinks (Budweiser beer, Coca-Cola), as well as products/logos from Victoria's Secret, Epson, Samsung, and Beats speakers.

It's less crude than the first sequel but more violent than the original. Tween and teen boys in particular will be interested in seeing this movie, but even younger kids who are familiar with the Hasbro toys may be curious about yet another live-action adaptation. Like all of director Michael Bay's films, there's a constant threat to all the characters -- in fact, humanity in general -- and an accompanying body count to match that sense of peril. Some robot deaths are particularly startling. Language is edgy, with frequent uses of \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and \"s--t\" and two variations on the F-bomb. This is a dream movie for car, weapon, and military aficionados, but not so much for young girls, since the only three women in the film are stereotypes -\u2013 the young blond \"hottie,\" the tough older careerist, and the wisecracking middle-aged mom.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite the requisite underlying themes of friendship and loyalty, there are a couple of shady messages about what it takes to succeed as a woman (be beautiful and sexy) and a few negative stereotypes and jokes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and the other Autobots are extremely loyal to Sam and humans in general, even when the government turns against them. Sam also will stop at nothing to help his Autobot friends and to save the love of his life. Other characters are brave, but it's their job to defend the innocent.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Incessant loud, explosion-based violence, usually featuring the robotic Transformers and human beings. The evil Transformers don't care about collateral human damage, and they routinely cause mass destruction to buildings, bridges, cars, and even national monuments like the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. There's a high body count, even though the camera never lingers on any human death (it does linger on Transformer deaths, including those of sympathetic secondary characters and one that's particularly gruesome). The military (including the Air Force special ops and Navy SEALs) uses technologically advanced weapons and gear to battle the Transformers that are threatening to turn humans into a slave race.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: No outright sex, but every scene Carly is in features her in either underwear (the actress is a famous Victoria's Secret model) or a revealing outfit. She and Sam kiss in bed and several other times. Her entire purpose is to be attractive and have others make comments about her \"hotness.\" Sam's mother makes inappropriate references to sex and even speculates about how \"big\" he is to have had two gorgeous girlfriends. In one scene, a sexily dressed Latina character is referred to as a \"hoochie mama,\" and her anger is called a \"Latin meltdown.\"\n|Language|: Surprisingly frequent use of the following words: \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"s--t,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"crap,\" \"ass,\" \"d--khead,\" and \"oh my God.\" One mouthed \"f--k,\" and one memorably (and humorously) said \"clusterf--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Not only is the entire series based on Hasbro toys, but there's also an extremely high number of product placements: from cars (General Motors, Mercedes, Corvette, and more) to electronics (Apple computers, iPad, Lenovo desktops) to water (Arrowhead) and apparel (Adidas, Nike, etc.).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: At a couple of dinner parties, adults are shown briefly with glasses in hand.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77683154f42c001f8c3b75": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the sequel to 2007's Transformers.

Kids will want to see it because they're the ones who play with the toys the movie was inspired by, but it's packed with metal-on-metal mayhem and brutally violent action scenes that are too much for them. While most of the combatants are giant robots, the film's human characters are in constant peril, and the explosions never seem to stop. There are also eyebrow-raising amounts of sexualized and even racially insensitive material, as well as strong language (including one use of \"f--k\" and frequent uses of words like \"bitch\" and \"p---y\"). Plus, it's essentially a long commercial for both cars and toys.\n|Positive Messages|: Any positive messages about friendship and fellowship are negated by the film's objectification of women and frequent use of phrases like \"bitch\" and \"p---y\" in a film ostensibly aimed at kids. There's also some racial and ethnic stereotyping; while a giant robot with a wacky \"Scottish\" accent seems harmless, two robots with protruding ears, grotesque features, and a propensity for thuggish rap slang like \"pop a cap in his ass\" and \"get up in that ass\" are less easy to write off as wacky fun.\n|Positive Role Models|: While Optimus Prime is a stalwart defender of the innocent, the other characters are so thinly crafted that it's virtually impossible to find anything to admire. Sam is loyal to his robot friends, but, again, the film is so suffused and soaked in bullets, bombs, and bombast that it's hard to hear the positivity over the explosions.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Nonstop explosions, gunfire, bombardments, and barrages affecting human beings, as well as tons of combat to the death between robotic (but intelligent and self-aware) aliens. Bodies are hurled by explosions and battle, and there's some scary torture/medical imagery. Extensive robotic carnage and destruction, as well as pushing, shoving, and scuffling. There's a threat to the sun, which, if carried out, will wipe out all human life.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Plenty of cleavage, shots of panty-clad bottoms, kissing. Dogs hump each other, and a robot proceeds to do the same to a woman's leg. A husband and wife engage in a little saucy talk and bottom-grabbing.

There's also an upsetting fight sequence between Prime and Bumblebee that nearly leads to one of their deaths. While there's only one kiss (and some hand holding), you can expect plenty of racy jokes and innuendo about sex/celibacy. Language is frequent and mostly along the lines of \"s--t\" and insults (\"d--khead,\"  \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" etc.). Despite the added diversity of a teen Latina character, many of the Decepticons' vocal performances still seem based in racial stereotypes, and the overwhelming majority of the characters are white.\n|Positive Messages|: A key message is that it's wrong to consider all Transformers evil -- i.e. you shouldn't discriminate against the whole because of the violent actions of a few. Shows the power of belief/faith/legends and the importance of unconditional friendship. Unfortunately, the positive themes are frequently overwhelmed by the fact that violence is used to settle all conflicts, as well as some stereotyping.\n|Positive Role Models|: Cade is a loyal friend to the Transformers he befriended in the previous movie. He's courageous and protective. Vivian is intelligent (she's an Oxford professor) and brave. Sir Edmund is also brave and willing to put himself in danger to help others. Several of the Transformers want to protect humanity. Izabella is strong, smart, and quick thinker, but she makes some impulsive, iffy decisions; she also starts out saying she doesn't want a boyfriend but quickly changes her tune. As in previous movies, the Decepticons' voices still feel based in racial stereotypes, and the majority of characters are white.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Tons of loud sci-fi/action violence -- including explosions, weapons, battle sequences, and fights between Transformers, humans, and Transformers and humans. Some people (especially in the Dark Ages flashbacks) and Transformers die. There's an upsetting fight between \"Nemesis\" Prime and Bumblee in which it seems like Prime is going to kill his loyal friend.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One passionate kiss. Hand holding. Innuendo about how Vivian is dressed like a stripper. Jokes about Cade's \"chaste\" lifestyle. A shot of Cade shirtless with the talisman slithering down his body into his pants. In one scene, Vivian's mom and aunts think she's having sex with Cade because they're in a room making a lot of noise and saying things like \"I can't get it out,\" etc.\n|Language|: Frequent use of \"s--t,\"  \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"d--khead,\" \"damn,\" \"pissed,\" \"stupid,\" \"jerk,\" \"horses--t,\" \"Christ!,\" \"God!\" (as exclamations), \"mo-fo,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: The entire franchise is based on Hasbro toys, which are popular with and marketed to kids who aren't old enough to see the movies. Also many product placements within the movie, from General Motors cars (Chevrolet, Dodge, Cadillac, etc.) to imported cars (Lamborghini, Range Rover, Mercedes, Lexus) and apparel (Nike, Adidas), as well as products/logos from Beats and Motorola.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults drink both in flashbacks and in contemporary scenes. Merlin is described as a drunkard and drinks from a bottle; he later promises to give up drinking if a Transformer will help save humanity. King Arthur and his knights lift up drinks for a toast. A Transformer brings Cade a beer from a fridge full of them. Women drink during a get together.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77682d103a2d001f565c58": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-transporter", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this movie features intense, non-stop peril and action violence, with massive destruction of property.

The female lead takes Ecstasy mixed with vodka at one point, and other characters smoke and drink. While the film nominally has a pro-environmental regulation message, it's paper-thin wrapping around a slick, glossy package of violence and velocity.\n|Positive Messages|: The plot revolves around a toxic-waste disposal scheme that sees a high government official's daughter kidnapped to coerce her father into clearing multiple shipments of illegal waste for docking and, presumably, dumping. Nominally, the movie's message is meant to be pro-environmental regulation. Extensive violation of the rules of the road.

Time and again, the film puts young Jim Hawkins and his treasure-hunting partners in danger. Soaring cartoon mayhem and suspense come from mighty explosions, firestorms, black holes, mutinous interspecies creatures, air battles, and multiple narrow escapes. A few featured characters die; one falls into a black hole. Lots of comedy along with the derring-do, including a creature who speaks \"flatula\" loud, clear, and odiferous.\n|Educational Value|: Introduces a number of scientific terms, which could be explored further (i.e., cyborg, astrophysicist, black hole). Places, events, and characters from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Treasure Island in the future and cleverly combines the two eras.\n|Positive Messages|: Jim Hawkins learns a great deal about coming to terms with an early tragedy and overcoming grief with constructive behavior. He comes to understand the value of \"charting his own course\" and sticking with it. A seemingly heartless villain is redeemed, proving that change for the better is always a possibility.\n|Positive Role Models|: Consistently In trouble and nearly breaking his single mother\u2019s heart, Jim matures into a courageous, honest, and loyal young man who makes heroic choices. The female captain of the pirate ship is a leader of the first order: wise, strong, and in control. Villains and heroes come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and species.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Cartoon action throughout: chases, battles, falls, all manner of weaponry from the swords of centuries ago to lasers, explosions and portals leading to the unknown. Two characters die; many others are nearly killed by firestorms, falls through space, explosives, gun and cannon fire, sabotage, and toothy, clawed aliens.

Younger viewers could be upset by the movie's violence -- including the apparent deaths of several beloved characters -- and the theme of destroying humankind in order to save the Earth. The violence is animated and cartoonish, but it's constant. Battles involve many kinds of weapons, and there are falls, explosions, stabbings, strangulations, fires and flames, ice and waves, giant monsters and robots, high-speed crashes, radiation, electric shocks, cannonballs, guns, and more. Characters sacrifice themselves to save others, and some human bystanders are affected, like pedestrians on a city street who witness a subway crash and are then surrounded by a circle of fire to restrain them (the perpetrator warns: \"Let go, or the humans perish -- and so do your friends!\"). Other innocent victims include people in cars on a bridge in Hong Kong that collapses and a school bus full of high schoolers that barely escapes unscathed. \"We're all going to die,\" one character frets -- and, indeed, several characters do. Villains have scary voices and glowing eyes. Characters kiss, and a man is impregnated by his alien girlfriend and births multiple babies. But facing killer enemies and the possible end of the world, the heroes show courage and teamwork to save the day.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork is more important and effective than individual achievements. It's essential to recognize one's limitations. Fear is a precursor to valor. Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all. Humans must respect nature and the planet. Believe in yourself.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jim finds strength and courage within, even when he's stripped of his amulet and armor. He and his mates realize the importance and value of working in a team. Other characters selflessly put their own lives in jeopardy to save each other or humankind and the earth as a whole. Marriage and love between species (humans, trolls, aliens) is seen as natural.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There are battles involving all kinds of characters and weaponry, falls, explosions, stabbings, strangulations, fires and flames, ice and waves, giant monsters and robots, high-speed crashes, radiation, electric shocks, cannonballs, guns, and more.

It centers on peppy troll Princess Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick), who teams up with grumpy pessimist Branch (Justin Timberlake) to rescue her friends from the troll-hungry Bergens. Along the way everyone learns lessons about inner happiness, never giving up, and being proud of who you are. Everything has a fuzzy, felted look to it, which softens some of the danger and peril. But little kids are still likely to be scared by the greedy, hungry Bergens. And they may well hide their eyes when Poppy and her friends flee from danger and have several narrow escapes. There's also a sad moment when Branch remembers losing someone he loved. Two of the Bergens flirt, striking some \"sexy\" poses and exchanging a couple of mild innuendoes. Bodily function humor includes the projectile-glitter farts of Poppy's sparkly friend, Guy Diamond, whose glittery buttocks are also visible. Expect a few uses of \"OMG\"/\"oh my gah\" (the ending of the word is left undefined) and \"stupid\"/other insults. But in the end, what you'll remember are the great songs, the strong themes of friendship and empathy, and the fun characters.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn lessons about the importance of empathy and perseverance, as well as believing in yourself and never giving up.\n|Positive Messages|: Never give up. Everyone has the potential to be happy, and you shouldn't pin all your hopes for happiness on something outside yourself. It's important to be loved and appreciated for who you really are; you shouldn't have to change how you look/act to make someone interested in you. And having fun is great, but you can't just do what you want all the time -- you also have to be responsible and think about consequences. Friendship and loyalty are important. Some bodily function humor (notably, shiny trolls who shoot glitter out of their bottoms when they pass gas).\n|Positive Role Models|: Poppy is a strong female character. She's brave, loyal, positive, and a good friend. She never gives up. She starts out only thinking about fun but learns the importance of considering consequences. She empathizes with Bridget and sticks with her. Branch starts out cynical and pessimistic but learns to be happy again. He's resourceful and smart and very well-prepared. Bridget learns to stand up for herself and be proud of who she is. The other Bergens are greedy and selfish but also open to new ideas (except for Chef, who's nasty, through and through). The trolls are a diverse bunch who come in all shapes, colors, and sizes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril. The Bergens are scary looking (especially Chef); they threaten to eat the trolls, and they brandish knives and other cooking implements around them. Tense chase scenes and times when it looks like not all the trolls survive. Bergens invade the trolls' party and cause fear and panic, then capture many of them. Poppy encounters/dodges many hungry predators on her way to Bergentown. She, Branch, and their friends are chased by a big, vicious dog-like animal and have lots of other narrow escapes; sometimes it seems as though trolls have been eaten. Branch recalls a sad moment from his past, when he lost someone he loved. Chef treats Bridget very cruelly. In the end, it appears two bad-guy characters meet a fiery fate.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Bridget has a huge crush on the prince. They flirt, and, as Lady Glitter Sparkles, Bridget strikes \"sexy\" poses to get his attention. He calls her \"hot lunch,\" and at one point makes a reference to finding \"another way to work up an appetite\" (turns out he's referring to roller skating). Flirting/romantic tension between Poppy and Branch. Glitter-covered trolls have bare, sparkly bottoms.\n|Language|: A few uses of \"OMG\" (also said as \"oh my gah,\" with the ending of the word not clearly defined), plus \"stupid\" and insults like \"dumpy diapers.\" Also slang like \"oh, snap,\" \"YOLO,\" and \"solid burn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement within the movie, but the whole movie is based on a toy line, and there are tons of offline merchandising tie-ins.

This time around, Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick), Branch (Justin Timberlake), and their friends aren't up against the Bergens, but rather other groups of Trolls, each representing a different genre of music. The Hard Rock Trolls want to turn everyone else into Rock Trolls, too, so the heroes must try to save the others' musical styles -- which helps drive home the movie's messages about the importance of diversity in thought, musical taste, and cultural preferences. The story also promotes teamwork, communication, empathy, friendship, and loyalty. Expect a bit of insult/rude language (\"screwed,\" \"dang,\" \"you suck\"). There's also peril as the Rock Trolls wreak havoc and destruction and kidnap and terrorize other Troll groups. A character on the verge of drowning glimpses his \"heaven\" but quickly comes back to life. Poppy and Branch flirt and have romantic tension.The all-star cast performs a combination of original and cover songs, and notable additions to the voice roster include Rachel Bloom, Kelly Clarkson, and Ozzy Osbourne.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn lessons about the importance of empathy, communication, and teamwork, as well as the value of diversity and tolerance/acceptance of different backgrounds, cultures, and interests.\n|Positive Messages|: Main message is to learn how to listen to others instead of always trying to speak/push your own agenda.

Strong message to value others' differences, to listen to voices other than your own, to recognize how different opinions, backgrounds, and beliefs make all of us stronger.\n|Positive Role Models|: Poppy is a strong leader.

Despite misguided beliefs about what's best for all Trolls, Barb eventually sees the error of her ways. Trolls are diverse and come in all shapes, colors, sizes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Barb and her Hard Rock Trolls terrorize other territories, destroying lands and kidnapping leaders to pursue domination of Trolls and turn them all into Rock lovers. Five non-Rock lands need to be rebuilt and restored. In the country music land, the leaders imprison the Pop Trolls. Musical bounty hunters are sent out to round up Poppy and Branch.

Younger kids may find Trouble's predicament sad, if not a little scary. Animated skirmishes with other dogs, oncoming traffic, a menacing animal tracker seen one time with a gun, and a gang of dancing squirrels are more funny than frightening. The same goes for a short stint in the dog pound, where one inmate plays soulful prison music with his paws. Expect lots of bodily function humor, especially \"nut\" jokes and references. There's a play on words that some kids might pick up on involving the confusion of \"shedhouse\" and \"s--thouse.\" Insults include \"stupid,\" \"dumb,\" \"idiot,\" \"mutt,\" \"pip-squeak,\" \"punk,\" and \"slimeball.\" The film's messages are that home is where the heart is, and love and family are more important than wealth and possessions.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can learn about both the responsibilities and the joys of pet ownership.\n|Positive Messages|: Love and family are more important than wealth and possessions. Home is where the heart is. Friends help each other. Greed and lying don't pay. Pets offer their owners unconditional love in exchange for good care.\n|Positive Role Models|: Trouble is undyingly faithful to his owner and, when she passes on and he gets lost in the city, he still retains his faith in humankind. When Zoe takes him in, he bonds with her immediately and she quickly comes to love and want to care for him as well. Trouble befriends street and park dogs and helps Rousey regain her desire for human connection. The park dogs form a pack and look out for one another. Mrs. Vanderwhoozie's niece and nephew are only interested in her money, and they lie, cheat, and mistreat their aunt's staff in their pursuit of an inheritance. The film's voice cast is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Trouble's loving owner passes away. Trouble falls out of a truck and tumbles down a hill.

Language is strong, and includes \"f--k\" and \"s--t.\" Teens are definitely thinking about sex, and there's some sexual innuendo and partial nudity (underwear shots).\n|Positive Messages|: Despite all of the blood and carnage, the movie's main theme is \"never judge a book by its cover,\" as it turns the old \"evil hillbilly\" horror movie cliche on its ear. A city girl learns to look past a man's rough exterior and see the kind, decent person he is inside. Characters also attempt to work together to solve problems and resolve conflict.\n|Positive Role Models|: Dale shows intelligence, kindness, and courage throughout the story, even when his best friend picks on him and talks down to him.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of horror movie violence, including bashed-in and bloody heads, saw blades to the face, a machete to the throat, a teen stabbed by a branch, a teen chewed up in a wood-chipper, a shovel to the face, nails through the head, gunshot to the face, severed fingers, an explosion, and gallons of blood and gore.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A teen girl strips down to her underwear to swim. Teens kiss and are definitely thinking about sex. Lots of sexual humor and innuendo.\n|Language|: Strong language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" \"bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation), \"crap,\" and \"dickwad,\" plus the middle finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: One mention of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Teens drink beer and smoke pot while on their \"vacation,\" though this isn't depicted as regular behavior. They also drink while driving. The hillbillies also drink beer, though all drinking stops when the violence starts.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768bd33f255001e85e561": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/turbo", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Turbo is a funny animated underdog comedy with strong positive messages. Themes that run throughout the movie (and are reinforced constantly) include believing in yourself, following your dreams, and never giving up. Kids will find the silly characters endlessly amusing, with only a little bit of innuendo, stereotyping, and potty humor to contend with. The biggest concern is the repeated scenes of peril, in which the beloved snails seem to be in danger thanks to a lawnmower, a busy freeway, plentiful crows, and a car crash. But all scenes involving major characters are resolved positively.\n|Educational Value|: Intended for entertainment, not education, but kids will be introduced to the sport of professional car racing.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie is steeped in positive messages, which are reinforced repeatedly: \"No dream is too big, no dreamer too small.\" Plus, never give up, believe in yourself, and make the most of today. It also emphasizes the importance of having supportive friends and family. On the downside, there's a little bit of weight-related humor at the expense of a large snail who can't fit back into his shell.\n|Positive Role Models|: Turbo is full of energy, enthusiasm, and big dreams, just like his human buddy, Tito. Both have siblings who are frustrated by their brothers' repeated attempts to accomplish something big. Secondary characters are mostly supportive or there for comic relief. The human characters are exaggerated types whose characteristics make them borderline stereotypes (Asian nail salon owner, pasty hobby shop guy, tough female auto mechanic). The villain starts out heroic, if vain, and ends up a big meanie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes that are perilous but not super scary, including a snail's encounter with a lawnmower, a dangerous trek past a freeway and through urban streets, and a big car crash in which folks are dazed but not seriously injured. Several scenes in which a crow swoops down and picks off a snail, presumably ending in death to the snail. A crow gets hit by a bus. Some comments about someone being \"dead meat\" or being \"slaughtered,\" which the snails take as threats -- but the comments end up being innocuous.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One scene in which a group of male snails makes comments while looking at something -- \"nice curves,\" \"giant juicy temptress,\" etc. -- but it ends up being a tomato. A female snail flirts briefly with a male snail, and later they seem to be a couple.\n|Language|: Some teasing and occasional use of terms like \"son of a gun.\" A few snails have potty-related names like \"Skid Mark\" and \"Smoove Moove.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Product placement includes Chevy, Verizon, and HP.

The panda transformation -- which can sometimes be intense and leads to both unintended and purposeful damage/destruction -- is definitely a metaphor for adolescence, and the movie skews more toward an older tween/early teen audience than many of Pixar's other films. The story centers the city's Chinatown community where Mei lives and features an authentically diverse cast. With puberty and adolescence at the heart of the action, expect references to periods and celebrity crushes, discussions of \"hotness,\" and descriptions of the attractiveness of popular singers (as well as another older teen) and their gyrating dance moves. Occasional mild and insult language includes \"crap,\" \"freak,\" \"jerkwad,\" \"butthead,\" etc. The film encourages curiosity, compassion, courage, self-control, and teamwork, and families who watch together can discuss lots of issues afterward, from the importance of having honest conversations about puberty to the dangers of lying and keeping secrets and the need for both close friends and trusted adults.\n|Positive Messages|: Promotes open and honest communication between parents and kids, particularly teens. Highlights challenges of adolescence and how the process can deepen bonds between friends and between parents and teens. Encourages curiosity, compassion, courage, self-control, teamwork.\n|Positive Role Models|: Mei is a caring, thoughtful daughter, a compassionate friend. After her inner panda is unleashed, she becomes more curious, adventurous, courageous, but she also lies to her parents and keeps secrets from them. In one scene, she's disrespectful after weeks of not being honest with them. Mei's parents, especially her mom, have high expectations and can seem overprotective, but they love her unconditionally, want to do what's best for her. Mei's friends are supportive, kind, honest.\n|Diverse Representations|: Main character Mei and her family (as well as writer-director Domee Shi) are Chinese Canadian; Mei's best friends are White, South Asian, and Korean. Mei's Canadian nationality and Chinese ethnicity are both prominently featured, and voice actors were cast authentically. Mei lives in Chinatown, and her family runs a temple. Strong representation of a young woman going through puberty and the confusing, awkward, hormonally charged nature of adolescence. Tight girl friendships are a major theme.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The panda transformation can come with a dark side. When the panda gets angry, she can cause both purposeful and accidental damage. Lunar ceremony that Mei goes through seems painful. Mass property damage during a concert scene when a giant, somewhat scary red panda wreaks havoc, forcing concertgoers to run for their lives; even the musicians look in danger (it's eventually played for laughs). After she transforms, Mei is kept in her room and jumps around, butting her head against walls and causing minor damage. Mei throws a dodgeball with her panda arm, and it goes so fast the ball breaks a window. Supernatural pandas push and fight one another. Arguments, confrontations.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Young teens have crushes on members of a boy band. They kiss the band's CD and poster and talk about the attractiveness of each member. A girl finds a boy cute and ends up sketching various images of him -- e.g., him as a merman, the two of them kissing, etc. She sweats as she draws the images, telegraphing her attraction/infatuation. Discussions of \"hotness\" and the boy band's gyrating moves. Teen hormones and puberty/adolescence (including talk of a girl's period) are a major theme.\n|Language|: Insult language like \"dork,\" \"narc,\" \"brainwashed,\" \"jerkwad,\" \"butthead,\" \"freak,\" \"psycho mom,\" \"creepy temple,\" and \"crap.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Off-screen product tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Mei's mom makes a comment that a boy's behavior is the result of not wearing sunblock and of \"doing drugs all day.\"\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77696047dd6e001f6c49a5": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/a-turtles-tale-2-sammys-escape-from-paradise", "cs_age": 4, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 4+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that A Turtle's Tale 2 is the sequel to the Belgian animated adventure A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures and includes some scary scenes and characters, a villainous (albeit small) bully, and a lot more alcohol than is usually depicted in kids' movies. The alcohol is courtesy of the setting: an upscale underwater restaurant/aquarium, where bartenders make lots of cocktails for adult diners. There's also some romance between animal mates, as with the hogfish and the protagonist turtles when they reunite with their wives. Young kids will learn about various sea animals and their life cycles.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about various kinds of sea life, from sea turtles (both green and leatherback) to blobfish, hogfish, and octopus. The sea turtle's life cycle isn't as prominent as in the first movie, but little kids will watch as older turtles help hatchlings reach the water.\n|Positive Messages|: This is a story of friendship and family and of overcoming the odds to save those you love. The movie also stresses that bullies come in all shapes and sizes and aren't always the biggest or most threatening-looking characters.\n|Positive Role Models|: Sammy and Ray do everything they can to save their grandkids and later to help the entire aquarium full of sea animals to escape their imprisonment. There's some stereotyping with accents -- exaggerated Spanish accents for the hogfish and a bully that sounds like a mafia don.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The moment the turtles get caught in the net is rather scary, similar to Finding Nemo. Then, in the aquarium, the seahorse Big D acts like a mob boss and has dissenters \"iced\" by having them thrown into the freezing waters where the penguins live. An otherwise harmless shark puts a smaller sea animal into his mouth but doesn't kill him. The juvenile sea turtles are chased by an underwater predator.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The hogfish couple is very affectionate and kissy-kissy with each other.

There are some elements of potential peril in which Sammy and his friends are separated or have to be rescued. Nothing is too upsetting, however, because we know Sammy lives to an old age (he narrates the story of his life). Children will learn a great deal about global warming, sea turtles, their habits, and their overall life cycles from hatchlings to grandparents.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn environmental lessons about the importance of keeping the oceans clean, as well as various educational tidbits about sea turtles: their life cycles from hatchlings to elderly turtles, their mating habits and their migratory patterns.\n|Positive Messages|: Sammy's journey is one that teaches about friendship, the environment, love, and overcoming obstacles. The eco-friendly sequences explain why humans contaminate the sea and how pollution affects animals' everyday lives.\n|Positive Role Models|: Several of the sea animals are kind-hearted and courageous creatures who go out of their way to lend a hand to their friends.

Millions of kids 10 to 18 have read the books, and many more are familiar with them. Like the novel, the film features an intense romantic relationship between a gorgeous vampire and a human girl. There are a few kisses and several stares, hand touches, and embraces. One make-out session takes place on a bed with the girl in her underwear, but it's abruptly stopped. The movie's violence is mostly implied, but there's one particularly disturbing scene involving vampires, blood, a bitten human with a broken limb, and the destruction of an evil vampire. Language and drinking aren't issues; product placement is mostly limited to cars -- Volvo, Hummer, Mercedes, etc.\n|Positive Messages|: Bella and Edward's relationship sends a somewhat mixed message to teens -- it's chaste and loving, but it could also be perceived as obsessive. The Cullens are a very loyal family, and they strive to rise above their baser vampire instincts.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bella is mature and smart, but she can also be dependent and fragile. Edward is respectful and gallant, though often somewhat angsty. Contemporary Native Americans are featured respectfully.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A lot of the violence is implied: There are fast shots of vampires right before they kill their prey (both human and animal). A group of guys follows Bella down a dark alley and starts harassing her; Edward threatens them. A predatory vampire tries to kill Bella. There's a bloody, vicious fight between an evil vampire and the Cullens. Bella is seriously hurt and ends up in the hospital. Charlie, a sheriff, has weapons, including a shotgun.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: As in the book, Bella and Edward have an intensely romantic (though overall fairly chaste) relationship. They stare and gaze at each other lovingly and share some passionate embraces and a couple of kisses, including one make-out session that takes place on a bed while Bella's in her underwear. Other couples flirt, hold hands, and swoon at each other.\n|Language|: Incredibly mild for a PG-13 film, just like the book: \"repulsive,\" \"vile,\" \"dammit.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Brands featured include Volvo, Hummer, Mercedes, Mac, BMW, Lays potato chips, Body Glove, and Southwest. Most appearances are subtle, though Edward's Volvo has some big moments.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: No drinking or smoking by underage characters.

But parents of tweens and younger teens should know that this adaptation faithfully follows the book's mature, disturbing storyline concerning an extremely dangerous pregnancy. Although the action-based violence is mostly confined to a couple of werewolf vs. vampire skirmishes, the birth scene is like something out of a horror film; it's brimming with blood and gore and agonizing pain (though still less than what was in the book). Also, after three movies of abstinence, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally consummate their relationship in a bed-breaking honeymoon scene that shows a lot of skin but nothing R-rated. Families wary of discussing abortion or family planning should know that much of the film deals with those issues. There are also some sad/poignant goodbye scenes.\n|Positive Messages|: Bella doesn't rely on Edward to make an important, possibly self-sacrificing choice for her (having their baby). And despite the controversial pregnancy, the movie offers a positive outlook on what constitutes a \"family\" and how love can take many different forms. But Bella and Edward's marriage remains a sticky issue, since it's not widely considered a good idea for teens to consider marriage right out of high school.\n|Positive Role Models|: For once, it's Bella -- not Edward -- calling the shots, so regardless of how you feel about her decision regarding her pregnancy, it's hers to make. The Cullens are all selfless, generous, and peace-loving vampires. Jacob is at his best in this installment. Despite disagreeing with Bella, he guards her life -- and just when you think he's going to do something monstrous, he redeems himself.\n|Violence & Scariness|: (Note: Potential spoiler alerts.) Although, action-wise, this isn't the most violent of the Twilight movies, the extended and unforgettably bloody birth sequence seems straight out of a horror movie (though it's still far less bloody than the description in the book). There's also lots of pain during this scene, including scalpel cuts, the sound of breaking bones, and many screams. At one point, viewers briefly see Edward biting his way through Bella's uterus; he then pulls out the bloody baby, while Bella is also covered in blood and seems about to die. Edward then attempts to revive her with his venom by biting her on all of her pulse points. Bella looks frighteningly emaciated and on death's door throughout her pregnancy, and there are a few minutes when it seems she actually has died. There are several conversations about abortion, \"getting rid\" of the pregnancy, and \"fetus\" vs. \"baby\" debates. Bella drinks blood on several occasions like it's a milkshake. The wolves fight each other and, in one scene, the Cullens. Jacob looks poised to beat Edward up on a couple of occasions and even agrees to kill him should Bella die in childbirth. A brief cameo by the Volturi shows their humorous (to them) decision to have a human employee killed; in a bloody nightmare sequence, the Voluturi also kill many key characters -- their bodies are shown. A flashback shows Edward violently biting and killing three unsavory men.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: After sharing a couple of passionate kisses and getting married, Bella and Edward finally consummate their relationship on their honeymoon. Viewers see bare backs and other flashes of skin as Bella and Edward skinny dip (backs, chests, and a quick glimpse of Bella's breasts from the side as she embraces Edward), make out passionately in the water, and then move to the bed; there are also breathing sounds, lingerie shots, etc., and Edward is seen on top of Bella and consequently breaks the bedframe with his passion (he also bruises Bella). On another occasion, Bella has a sexy dream and wakes up pleading with Edward to make love. She also wears pretty skimpy lingerie and swimsuits. After the honeymoon, the romance is limited to one quick glimpse of the wolves and their mates kissing on the beach and some chaste embraces.\n|Language|: Less swearing than most PG-13 movies. Words include \"pissed off,\" \"crap,\" \"bloodsucker,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: The entire Cullen household is outfitted with Apple computers, Bella and Edward drive around in a Volvo (a car that's also available in real life), and there's a Tampax product placement. Off-camera, the movie franchise has huge merchandising tie-ins with cosmetics, apparel, accessories, toys, and more (even wedding dresses!).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Adults enjoy champagne (Bella's parents a bit too much) at Bella and Edward's posh wedding reception.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77688b9ab54400214e789b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that the final installment in the Twilight saga is a must-see movie for any fans (teen or otherwise) who've followed the series' page-to-screen adaptations -- as well as stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart's public relationship. The movie is fairly faithful to the second half of the Breaking Dawn book, except that it amplifies the violent nature of the book's climactic battle between the Cullens and the Volturi. Several characters are tortured, violently beheaded, burned, ripped apart by werewolves, etc., and there are some shocking deaths (though, overall, not much gore). There's one long, sensuous love scene (with close-ups of bare skin and faces and a glimpse of the side of Bella's breast, but nothing more graphic than that), as well as several passionate kisses between various couples. Language is minimal, as in all of the movies in the series.\n|Positive Messages|: The final installment in the Twilight series is about fulfilling your personal destiny, as Bella realizes that she was \"born\" to become a vampire. The importance of family and friendship is pivotal, as Bella decides to keep her father in her life, and the Cullens summon their vampire friends from around the globe to stand with them against the wrath of the Volturi.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bella finally comes into her own and no longer relies on the Cullens to defend her. Her special defensive skills allow her to shield herself and those she loves from other vampires' offensive tactics. The Cullens are once again exceptionally generous and kind. Charlie Swan is a patient, understanding father who's willing to accept Bella as she is, even though he knows something is really odd about her. Parenthood changes Bella and Edward, who finally have someone other than each other to focus on and protect. Jacob is loyal to a fault.\n|Violence & Scariness|: (Note: Potential spoilers ahead.). For most of the movie, the threat of violence looms, so the vampires practice their combat/defense abilities before facing the Volturi. In a flashback, a bloody-faced \"immortal child\" and his maker, a vampire \"mother,\" are killed and burned. During the climactic battle scene, various characters (major and minor) are injured, beheaded, burned, and otherwise hurt -- and even killed (some of the deaths are likely to be shocking). One vampire can telepathically torture people, another immobilizes their senses, and other vampires show off their abilities in battle.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Now that they're married, Edward and Bella have sex in a rather prolonged, sensuous sequence that tends to focus on close-ups of their faces and flashes of skin -- but no graphic nudity. In the final shot of the love scene, there's a glimpse of them standing in profile, and viewers can see their bare backs and the side of Bella's breast. Various passionate kisses both between Edward and Bella and other couples in the movie.\n|Language|: Language includes \"ass,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"bloodsucker,\" \"crap,\" \"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Bella drives a Volvo, but otherwise there are fewer obvious product placements than in some of the other Twilight movies.

As always, it's critical that parents understand that the story's central relationship is extremely intense -- almost to the point of addiction or obsession -- with Bella more than willing to forsake everything (even seeing her parents again) to turn into a vampire and join Edward for eternity. There's more vampire-on-vampire and wolf-on-vampire violence this time around; the climactic battle scene includes bloodless decapitations, dismemberments, and close-contact fighting. Compared to the first two movies, there's also quite a bit more sexuality -- with several passionate kisses and a frank discussion about virginity and first times. All of that said, like Stephenie Meyer's Twilight books, Eclipse has very little swearing and, except for one flashback scene, no drinking.\n|Positive Messages|: There are some positive messages in this story about love, friendship, and loyalty, but they're secondary to the overwhelming, obsessive nature of Edward and Bella's relationship and Bella's willingness to give up everything else to be with Edward. This time around, the couple does compromise on several points (when to have sex, when to \"turn\" Bella, whether she can stay friends with Jacob) instead of seeming to be completely led/directed by Edward.\n|Positive Role Models|: Bella is loyal and brave, but her relationship with Edward is too obsessive for her to be a purely positive role model for teens (or adults!). They love each other and protect each other, but she's ready to give up her family and her best friend for him at the age of 18. On the other hand, all of the main characters have admirable qualities that make them brave and loyal. Charlie and Bella are very close, even though their relationship isn't completely honest on her part. Jacob puts aside his pride to convince his pack to help the vampires and protect Bella.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This is the most violent Twilight movie to date, with an extended battle scene between the army of newborn vampires and the Cullen/werewolf alliance. Several decapitations and dismemberments (though no blood, since vampires break like ice when they're cut in half) and a high body count overall. In one disturbing flashback, a woman is shown about to be raped (though some younger viewers may miss that this is what's happening).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: As both the books and the movies progress, there is increasingly more kissing and sexuality because Edward isn't as afraid of touching Bella. Jacob and Bella share a passionate kiss. This installment also features two unwanted kisses that end in slaps across the face. Jacob is frequently shirtless; in one scene, he warms Bella with his body (no sensitive body parts shown).\n|Language|: Less swearing than most PG-13 movies. Language includes \"ass,\" \"bad-ass,\" \"damn,\" \"hell,\" \"bloodsucker,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Slightly less consumer product placement in this installment of the series, although Edward's car is again a Volvo SUV (XC60). The movie also has huge merchandising tie-ins with Volvo, the Lip Venom comsetics line, Mattel, Hot Topic, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In Rosalie's flashback, her fianc\u00e9 is shown drinking with several friends, all of whom are drunk.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776841880197001ec95c60": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-twilight-saga-new-moon", "cs_age": 13, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 13+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that the second installment in the hugely popular Twilight saga is darker and a bit more violent than the first movie, but not enough to make it inappropriate for teens, especially those who've read the books. That said, the relationship at the core of the story is obsessive and intense -- Bella's entire sense of self worth is wrapped up in being with Edward, which isn't the greatest example for young fans, who could get the wrong idea of what love is \"supposed\" to be like. Like Stephenie Meyer's books, the New Moon movie is virtually free of salty language, drinking, and smoking -- but there are some intense action sequences involving vampires and/or werewolves, and one supporting character dies. Bella and Edward share several kisses, while Jacob and Bella exchange many longing looks and charged embraces. And there's no question about the marketing machine that the Twilight franchise has become, with merchandise and promotional deals with companies including Burger King, Volvo, and Hot Topic.\n|Positive Messages|: Bella, while in some ways very mature, is the poster child for obsessive love in this movie. She intentionally acts recklessly in order to see Edward in her mind, which isn't a positive message to send young girls. And her relationship with Edward, while loving, continues to determine her happiness, as evident in her three months of catatonic depression after their break-up early in the film. Edward is downright suicidal at the thought of losing Bella forever, and his decision to provoke the Volturi is literally self-destructive. Platonic friendships are shown as being fraught with sexual tension, which is also iffy for tweens and adolescents. All of that said, there's a lot of selflessness here, too, with characters putting themselves at risk to help others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Even though Bella is an incredibly loyal friend and girlfriend, she also has far too much of her self esteem wrapped up in her intense relationships with Edward and Jacob. She never feels that she's worthy of Edward, and she admits to feeling selfish in the way that she clings to Jacob even while telling him she can never love him \"that way.\" That said, Edward and Jacob are both very protective of Bella, who is in turn protective of each of them. They all get a chance to save each other and don't hesitate to do so. And Charlie and Bella's father-daughter relationship, while not completely honest on Bella's part, is very close.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Notably more action and violence than in the first film. Early in the movie, Jasper almost attacks Bella, leading to a fight between him and Edward. Accident-prone Bella falls, bleeds, and gets bruised several times and in one case almost drowns to death. Victoria and the Wolf Pack have a big fight, as do the werewolves and Laurent. Bella slaps Sam; Paul then becomes aggressive and lunges at her in werewolf form, only to be caught in a fight with wolf-Jacob. The Volturi's minions dismember a guilty vampire (it's quick and not much is shown, but the effect is gory), almost kill Edward and Bella, and make Edward writhe in pain.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Although there's nothing explicit, all of Bella and Edward's scenes are filled with passionate looks, hugs (including one in which he's shirtless), and brief-but-intense kisses. Jacob holds Bella's hand and stares at her longingly, and they share several close embraces (two while he's shirtless) and at least three \"almost kisses.\" Other couples are shown holding hands, hugging, and kissing. No shortage of shirtless, buff guys, courtesy of the La Push Wolf Pack.\n|Language|: Just like the books, the worst is a few exclamations of \"what the hell,\" \"dammit,\" and \"oh my God,\" plus derogatory barbs like \"weird,\" \"wet dog,\" \"bloodsucker,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Volvo once again supplies Edward's car of choice (this time it's an XC60); other featured car brands include Porsche and Mercedes. Bella's computer is an Apple MacBook, and she and Alice fly Virgin America to Italy (which is amusing, since that division of Virgin doesn't fly to Europe). The movie also has huge merchandising tie-ins with Volvo, Burger King, and Hot Topic.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7770c523d5a3001f53bc67": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/two-by-two-overboard", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Two By Two: Overboard! is the sequel to 2015's All Creatures Big and Small and contains some slapstick violence and moments of peril. Though it's never directly referenced, the narrative is loosely based around the Noah's Ark story. The movie has some positive messages, such as the precarious truce between the carnivores and herbivores on the ark and the fictitious Nestrians species accepting outsiders. Lead characters Finny (voiced by Max Carolan) and Leah (Ava Connolly) are mischievous but kind. A character defies their orders for ethical reasons. The word \"butt\" is regularly used and there is some rude humor, including the Nestrians expelling blue gas when scared. Younger viewers might find some scenes too intense, including an underwater chase, characters being pummeled by waves when falling overboard, and a volcano eruption that destroys an entire settlement. The animals also suffer a shortage of food. There is also an upsetting scene in which a character dies and the camera lingers on their corpse. They are revived but the scene is part of a long sequence of panic and distress.\n|Educational Value|: Younger viewers may learn the difference between carnivores and herbivores. Though not referenced directly, the movie may start a discussion about the Noah's Ark story, which the movie is inspired by.\n|Positive Messages|: Teamwork, empathy, and defying orders for moral and ethical reasons.\n|Positive Role Models|: Carnivores and herbivores continue their truce despite a lack of food. Mischievous young mythical creatures Finny and Leah talk back to grown-ups, defy orders, and are washed overboard when sneaking out to steal food. But they work well together and help others. A species of animals on an isolated island learn to work with others in an emergency. The ship's chef keeps the lack of food a secret. The fictitious Nestrians are a helpful and highly skilled species.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of slapstick and some threat, including moments that might worry younger viewers. A character dies and the camera lingers on their corpse before another character revives them. Two characters fall overboard and are pounded by waves in a turbulent sea. A volcano eruption destroys an entire island and the residents panic. A dove is struck by lightning, chased by a shark, and burned. Characters are bound together and made to walk the plank. Characters are chased by scary looking creatures with huge sharp teeth, later revealed to be masks.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: \n|Language|: \"Butt\" said six times.

It's heavy on sexual references and scenarios (Jell-O wrestling, vibrating underwear, etc.) and light on sweetness. The characters are stereotypes until the end, and most of the messages about dating and relationships are shallow and, frankly, sexist (i.e. women should play games and hide all traces of their true personality if they want to \"land\" a man). There's also lots of strong language, from swear words like \"f--k\" and \"s--t\" to body-part terms like \"balls,\" \"c--k,\" \"p---y,\" and \"tits.\"\n|Positive Messages|: Although in the end the main characters learn that it's being yourself that matters, most of the movie revolves around sexist, stereotypical ideas of how a woman should act if she wants to \"land\" a man -- and how not to act if she doesn't want to scare them all away forever (it basically boils down to playing games and hiding all signs of your true personality...). Other choice bits of advice include never criticizing, laughing at all of a guy's jokes, being sexy but also aloof, etc.\n|Positive Role Models|: Both male and female characters are very stereotypical: The successful businesswoman loses out on romance and is written as a brittle perfectionist who can\u2019t find a boyfriend (even though she looks like Katherine Heigl...). Her counterpart is a boorish, sexist, noncommittal guy. Naturally, they both really have hearts of gold and manage to soften as the movie progresses, but the depiction of dating/relationships is still shallow and often cringe-inducing.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Abby almost falls out of a tree and needs rescuing; lots of verbal sparring, with some yelling.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Although the movie is more talk than action, there's a lot of talk, with frequent use of sexual/body part words and euphemisms like \"balls,\" \"p---y,\" \"tits,\" \"blow job,\" \"funbags,\" etc. and frank discussions about sex and attraction. After discussing masturbation with a male co-worker, a woman dons vibrating underwear and has an orgasm during a business dinner. Two other women wrestle in a vat of Jell-O in bikinis. There's also a brief shot of partial nudity (a naked man is shown from the back from the waist down), plus some passionate kissing and one scene with implied sex (including lots of noises).\n|Language|: Frequent use of everything from \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"p---y,\" and \"c--k\" to \"crap,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" \"bitch,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Pretty subtle placement of logos for a few products (BMW, for instance).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some social drinking (wine, mixed drinks), but the characters are all adults, and no one appears to overindulge.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d2a594b2b001e702c3b": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/uglydolls", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that UglyDolls is about a group of plushy toys who learn they're worthy of love despite their unconventional looks. While that core message is undeniably positive, other messages weaken its impact, including catchy songs that tell listeners they're unworthy if they're \"ugly\" and that it's important to follow conventional beauty standards if you want others to like you. Adults are likely to understand that these lyrics aren't intended to be taken at face value, but that's much less certain for kids. Happily, other songs have more positive messages -- including \"your differences make you special.\" And characters demonstrate perseverance and teamwork in pursuing their goals. There's a bit more scary stuff and violence than parents might expect, including hand-to-hand combat (no blood or injuries); several scenes in which characters fall or are pushed from great heights or down dark, scary holes; and a very frightening bit in which dolls are threatened with being \"recycled\" and are almost shredded by a big, loud, monster-like machine with sharp metal teeth. There's no sex or romance, but a male character offers his crush a bottle of sparkling wine and asks whether she can feel the \"energy\" between them. A few characters are stereotyped as \"mean girls\"; they do the bad guy's dirty work and talk in a clich\u00e9d way about boys, hairstyles, and makeup. Other characters are more sympathetic, including a doll who's dreaming of having a child to love her and a girl who's been trying to appear perfect and learns that she's lovable even if she's not. Kelly Clarkson and Nick Jonas co-star.\n|Positive Messages|: Messages somewhat mixed. Intended messages are that conventional beauty doesn't equal goodness, that an unconventional appearance doesn't equal worthlessness, that our differences are actually what make us unique and special. But often key characters say the exact opposite, so positive messages end up weakened. Still, movie joyfully proclaims \"Let our freak flags fly!\" and says that love and compassion are a doll's true purpose. Group of friends shows teamwork, perseverance in pursuing and fulfilling a goal.\n|Positive Role Models|: Moxy is a lovable character who, after learning experiences, comes to fully accept herself -- and to launch toward her dream (which she ultimately achieves). Mandy, a complex character, starts out as something of a villain but soon reveals herself as sympathetic to main characters' aims; she makes an important emotional shift. A group of friends is supportive of each other. A few female \"perfect dolls\" are stereotyped as \"mean girls,\" do most of the dirty work; they talk about hairstyles, lip gloss instead of anything deeper. Bad guy Lou is hyperfocused on perfection, has no tolerance for anyone who doesn't meet his rigorous standards.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A notch more intense than parents might expect: multiple scenes in which characters fall or are thrown from great heights and fall down dark, scary holes. UglyDolls are frequently threatened with being \"recycled\"; in one harrowing scene, they're thrown into recycling chute, almost shredded by sharp metal teeth of loud, red, glowing monster machine. Dolls battle in hand-to-hand combat. Dolls go up against potentially scary robot dog (which grabs one, carries him away, possibly to his doom), a big vacuum (which sucks one doll up), and a looming robot baby. Many characters are kidnapped and transported in big sacks through threatening tunnel.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Ugly Dog is interested in female dolls and says things like \"Feel the energy between us?\" At one point, he whips out a table and some sparkling wine and invites a female doll to join him.\n|Language|: Infrequent use of words including \"butt,\" \"oh ehm gosh,\" \"oh my doll,\" \"imbecile,\" \"sycophant,\" and hurtful phrases like \"you shouldn't even exist\" and \"get lost.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: No product placement within movie, but movie is based on a toy line, and there are tons of offline merchandising tie-ins.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: At one point, a male character whips out a bottle of sparkling wine as a romantic gesture to a female character.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d9f352aadeb7a0021ce1300": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/unaccompanied-minors", "cs_age": 7, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 7+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that although this film is relentlessly dumb, kids -- especially those who like slapstick violence and watching other kids outsmart adults -- will probably want to see it. (That said, during one preview screening, after about 30 minutes, a 6- or 7-year-old asked his mother if they could please go home.) The stranded kids misbehave both with and without adult supervision, throwing candy and toys, destroying furniture, and piling on top of the man assigned to watch them. They order food they can't pay for, steal a motorized cart, steal items from abandoned luggage, let loose a caged dog, sneak out of the airport, and watch as adults fall, crash, and rage (a chase on sleds/rafts leads to a crash and one man's bloody and bruised face). An aunt drinks herself into unconsciousness (played as comedy), and a boy finds a bra in a suitcase where he's trapped.

Expect lots of largely bloodless action violence, much of it in the form of set pieces in which the main characters have to fight faceless, dehumanized minions to get into or out of a location. Characters are frequently in mortal danger, including dangling from a flying plane and being trapped in an underground cavern that's filling with water. Guns are used, and people are killed by being hurled off of vehicles and falling great distances; one has his throat slit, and viewers see some blood and his dead body. Sexual content is limited to flirting, suggestive looks, and a scene that shows people in bed, implying that they slept together. While two of the main characters are women who are depicted as just as strong and brave as the men, they also wear clingy and sometimes unrealistically bare costumes that would be difficult to fight in, including spiked heels. Language includes \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"oh my God,\" and more. Characters drink frequently; in one scene, three people share at least 10 bottles of wine and appear bleary and sloppy afterward. One character holds a cigarette and tries to light it but doesn't succeed. Drake is depicted as more heroic than the other characters because he doesn't betray his fellow adventurers, yet, like them, he pursues the lost Spanish gold at seemingly any cost, without concern for death and injury.\n|Positive Messages|: Like in the game, the movie takes place in a world where people have few scruples and angle after ill-gotten gains (in this case, a missing treasure). Never considers what the Spanish treasure ship and the explorers who crewed it did to the land and people they plundered, nor whether finding and keeping the gold is worth the toll it ultimately takes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Central character Nate is intended to be seen as principled compared to his fellow adventurers, who don't hesitate to double-cross each other. And he is indeed loyal to those he considers his friends, but he also kills dozens in his pursuit of wealth and never seems to question it. Sully and Chloe are even less principled, betraying each other at almost every turn, as well as killing conveniently anonymous villains.\n|Diverse Representations|: The two top-billed stars are White men. Within the central quintet of tough, brave characters, two are young women of color; everyone else is male. An antagonist is a man of unspecified Latino heritage who frequently speaks Spanish. Female characters are sexualized with bare, clingy costumes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent action violence, with many set pieces in which the main characters must fight their way into or out of situations. Characters are often in mortal danger -- e.g., a scene in which they're trapped in an underground chamber filling with water. Two people are accidentally ejected from an aircraft and fall through the air while taking out villains. Deaths take place on-screen, including scenes in which throats are slit, characters are stabbed, and people fall off of planes and helicopters; blood is infrequent, and only one dead body is visible at length. Guns are used/brandished. Most of the opposition that main characters face is of the anonymous-henchperson type, with assailants seen quickly and dehumanized by shots that hide their faces.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Flirting. A male character looks suggestively at a woman's body as she walks away; he's warned off by another character. References to characters being \"together,\" and a scene in which characters are seen asleep in bed with the implication that they slept together. Female characters, particularly one antagonist, wear costumes that are impractically tight and bare; male characters are frequently seen shirtless.\n|Language|: Language and cursing includes \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"hell,\" \"bastards,\" \"ass,\" \"crap,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"Jesus\" (as an exclamation). Characters frequently say something \"sucks.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Characters are pursuing a trove of gold from a lost Spanish sailing foray; it's said to be worth billions.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Several scenes take place at bars, with characters ordering cocktails by name (martini, negroni) and a bartender showily twirling bottles. In another scene, characters bond by drinking wine; by night's end, all look bleary and exhausted, and the room is littered with perhaps 10 bottles (for three people).

It has quite a lot of violence, mostly centered around big, brawling fistfights, car chases and crashes, and explosions. Brief flashback scenes show a married couple kissing and making love (no nudity). Language is infrequent (a couple of uses of \"s--t\" is the worst of it), and while the bad guys use an array of mysterious lethal/knockout drugs, there are no \"real\" drugs. Overall, the biggest problem is that it's slow and uninvolving, with a downer of a message (\"you can't trust anyone\") and a main character who isn't particularly sympathetic or admirable.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's message is a downer: You may believe one thing about yourself, but if enough people tell you otherwise, it may not be true. You can't trust anyone, and if you do, your life -- and the lives of your friends -- could be in danger.\n|Positive Role Models|: The movie's hero isn't a particularly good role model in that he's violent and argumentative, acts desperately, and is really rather helpless.

The film's complex topic is given nuanced treatment, but ultimately its sympathies lie firmly in pro-life sentiment. Graphic content is all related to abortion, and it's very realistic and disturbing. Viewers see two \"procedures\": a surgical abortion and a chemical abortion (via RU486). In the first scene, a woman cries, and there are images of a well-formed 13-week-old fetus writhing and twisting as if in pain, trying to hold on to the sides of the uterus as it's sucked out (some experts have firmly disputed the accuracy of these scenes). In the second, a woman retches into a toilet, crying with agonizing cramps while blood and chunks fall out from between her legs; there are bloody smears all over her bathroom. Other scenes show technicians reassembling the bodies of aborted fetuses to make sure there's nothing left in the mother's bodies; viewers see a very small realistic dead fetus' head, face, and arm. A physician who performs abortions is shot; viewers see a news report about it, but there are no images of the shooting. A protestor holds up a picture of a dismembered infant. Characters kiss, and some drink at dinner and while watching TV, but no one acts drunk. Cursing is mild (\"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"ass\"), but there's other upsetting language, like when a man yells at a woman that she's a \"baby killer\" who \"couldn't keep her legs closed.\" Viewers' take on this film will largely depend on their views around abortion, but it has both messages of compassion and empathy and scenes in which characters are cruel to one another.\n|Positive Messages|: A complicated topic is given layered treatment. Ultimately, film firmly communicates pro-life concepts, so how you take that message will depend on your feelings on the subject. Similarly, its complex themes may be viewed differently by different people but include both compassion and empathy and scenes in which people show each other great cruelty.\n|Positive Role Models|: Abby is depicted as a principled woman who has a change of heart after a series of complicated experiences; she's shown at first wholeheartedly supporting abortion and then slowly changing her mind. Pro-life protestors are portrayed with nuance; some quietly pray and say caring things, some hold up graphic signs and say things like, \"Hi, Princess, does your daddy know you're here killing his little grandbabies?\" Planned Parenthood executive is painted as villain, coldly advocating abortion as good for company's bottom line.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Violence is extremely disturbing, realistic. Emotional consequences shown at excruciating length. A long early scene depicts surgical abortion: Viewers see a woman covered in a sheet, crying and whimpering \"It hurts!\" Picture of 13-week-old fetus shown on ultrasound, kicking and writhing as if in pain before getting pulled out of uterus, trying to hold on to sides as it's sucked out (some doctors have firmly disputed the accuracy of these images). Blood and tissue shown streaming through tubes, with liquid noises. Abortion clinic protestors hold up signs with graphic photos (e.g., unborn baby with dismembered limbs). A woman has an abortion via RU486; viewers see her retching into toilet (no vomit visible), groaning with clearly agonizing pain; blood, bloody chunks fall out from between her legs. At scene's end, camera pulls up to show bloody spatters, pools all over bathroom.

A character sees realistic pre-term dead fetus in petri dish that she examines with an instrument, lifting small, bloody hand. A physician who performs abortions is shot; viewers see news report about it (does not include images of shooting).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A woman explains how she got pregnant and got an abortion.

A pro-life protester screams at a woman who's coming to Abby's clinic for an abortion that she \"couldn't keep her legs closed.\"\n|Language|: Infrequent language includes \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"ass.\" Other inflammatory language: a character calls women \"princess\" and \"twinkies\" as well as a woman getting an abortion a \"baby killer.\" Several characters tell each other to \"shut up.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A man drinks a beer as he watches television.

Young Ellie befriends an otherwise lonely young Carl; they become best friends and later a married couple. He takes care of her after she grows ill, and he embarks on a journey to fulfill a lifelong dream of theirs. Russell is a spunky, determined kid. Characters demonstrate integrity, empathy, and gratitude.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's some mild peril from thunderstorms hitting the house, and a sad sequence that shows Ellie sick in the hospital and then Carl in a funeral home, surrounded by flowers. Both a real gun and a tranquilizer gun are fired at various characters. A house gets set on fire. Younger kids might be scared by some 3-D images that jump at them from the screen, as well as Muntz' dogs, which sometimes appear seemingly out of nowhere, growling and angry.

The film includes scenes of war and police state tactics, including the brutal incarceration of race and sexual minorities in Britain. A young girl sees her mother kidnapped by government flunkies, then witnesses a similar brutality as an adult. When a bishop arranges for sex with an underage girl (apparently a regular practice), he's killed as punishment (but not before he pushes his would-be girl victim onto his bed).

Ed Helms stars as a grown-up Rusty Griswold, who hopes to recreate the infamous road trip his own family took when he was a teen. Like the 1983 version, this Vacation is chock full of crass humor, coarse comments, sexual references, and constant strong language. Nearly every line of dialogue includes an obscenity -- from \"motherf---er,\" \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and \"bulls--t\" to \"p---y,\" \"d--k,\" and more. Violent moments/topics are played for humor (like siblings roughing each other up, a fist fight between families, a woman in a car getting killed by a truck, jokes about rape, pedophilia, incest, and more), and sexual content includes glimpses of bare breasts, scenes in which a man's large genitals are clearly outlined by his underwear, tons of crude innuendo and graphic references, and a scene of several partially nude couples waiting to have sex in public. One scene includes a mom chugging beer and then projectile vomiting while running an obstacle course.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the crude/over-the-top content are some messages about steadfast marriages and the idea that vacations form lasting impressions on kids.\n|Positive Role Models|: Rusty is a sweet and caring father who genuinely wants to lead his family on a memorable trip ... though he doesn't always make the best decisions. Other characters behave in very iffy ways (often for humor).\n|Violence & Scariness|: Kevin tackles and punches his older brother, James, and repeatedly puts a plastic bag over his head. The Griswolds end up in a fist fight with another family. Jokes about a trucker being a rapist and a pedophile. A man with a death wish ends up killing himself while rafting. A woman in a car is killed by an oncoming truck on the highway. Rusty runs over a steer with an ATV and ends up with blood on him. Most of this is played for humor.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nudity and several references to sex, promiscuity, groping, and sex acts. A married couple attempts to have sex several times but is foiled, including once when they try to have sex publicly but are met with other couples also waiting to have sex (or in the middle of it). Quick glimpses of breasts. The outline of a man's extra-large penis is visible through his boxer briefs. Friends recall how a woman was known for \"doing anything\" (like performing sex acts on an administrator). A teenage boy means to ask a girl if they can kiss on the lips but inadvertently asks for a much more explicit act (he was told it meant \"kissing with mouths closed\"). Dirty talk like \"I'm gonna pound the s--t out of you,\" \"Why don't you plug up your ears with Mitt Romney's d--k?,\" etc.\n|Language|: Strong language in basically every scene, particularly \"motherf--ker,\" \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"p---y\" (often said by the younger son in the family).

Kids may be interested because it features WWE star John Cena, but this movie isn't intended for kids. While on vacation in Mexico, four adults let loose for a week with heavy drinking and a variety of drugs that elicit wild behavior. On the last night, the main character blacks out and can't remember what happens, but he's convinced there was sex involved. We learn the details later. There's more sex talk than activity in this film, though we do see a man's naked bottom and women moving back and forth on top of a man (fully dressed, seen from the waist up). Expect a fair amount of crude sexual and anatomical references. Another unintentional drug trip is portrayed in wild colors, sounds and hallucinations. There's mention or use of cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, pills, DMT, and marijuana. Some violence is played entirely for comedy, including an apparent gunshot wound, a boat crash, and a fist fight. There are also some jokes about drug trafficking, human trafficking, child abduction, infertility, and cancer. Language includes variations on \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"damn it,\" \"ass,\" \"d--k,\" and more.\n|Positive Messages|: Friends attempt to help each other out, even without being asked. Friends you meet on vacation aren't necessarily friends you want for life, but it's good to give people a chance. You should value people for their actions and intentions rather than their station in life.\n|Positive Role Models|: Marcus runs a construction business ethically and treats his employees with dignity, but his soon-to-be father-in-law looks down on him because of his industry. Marcus is strait-laced and he and his fianc\u00e9e Emily seem to need to let loose a little. Partiers Ron and Kyla show them how, but also cross multiple lines in terms of privacy, consumption, and appropriate public behavior.\n|Diverse Representations|: A Black couple befriends a White couple while on vacation. Race never seems to be an issue beyond the occasional joke, for example about differing hair textures. Military veterans and union members have special bonds. The story starts out in Mexico and much of the soundtrack is in Spanish.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A boat crash leads to people being evacuated from the sea by helicopter (they're fine and discuss going out to celebrate while still in the chopper). Ron pays to get Marcus in a wrestling ring, but he avoids getting hurt. Kyla jokes that Ron abducted her as a child and is holding her against her will. Ron shoots a gun at Marcus's head as part of a game; he appears to have been superficially wounded when Ron shoots back at him. The two couples jump off a high cliff together. Marcus and Emily's brother have an ongoing feud about a time Marcus punched Emily's brother. A fist fight breaks out between a group of men.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: There's more sex talk than sexual activity, but we do see a man's naked bottom and women moving back and forth on top of a man (fully dressed, seen from the waist up). Characters talk about \"jacking off,\" something that \"makes my d--k hard,\" a \"f--kfest,\" semen shooting versus dribbling, and being \"horny.\" A man thinks he cheated on his wife and is unclear whether his wife cheated on him and with whom. A woman is pregnant and it's unclear who the father is.\n|Language|: Variations on \"f--k.\" \"S--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"damn it,\" \"ass,\" \"dumbass,\" \"screw it,\" \"hell,\" \"cocked up,\" \"farting,\" \"Jesus,\" \"God,\" \"balls,\" \"anus,\" \"pubes,\" \"d--k,\" \"butt.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Ferrari, Green Berets, Waffle House, Hennessy, Hugo Boss, Vera Wang.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Abundant consumption, often excessive, of alcohol. The characters ingest or talk about taking cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, pills, DMT, and marijuana, sometimes without realizing they're taking a drug. A woman gives a grandma homeopathic drugs that seem to cure her of various ailments. A person jokes that he's given another person heroin without him knowing it. One night of drugs and alcohol results in blackouts and behavior uncharacteristic of at least one person. A drug trip in the forest is depicted in wild colors, sounds, and hallucinations. Characters joke more than once about drug trafficking, including the idea of smuggling drugs in the anal cavity.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768615af944001f2015b6": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/valentines-day", "cs_age": 15, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 15+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Valentine's Day is an ensemble romantic comedy from director Garry Marshall -- which stars everyone from Julia Roberts, Jennifer Garner, and Anne Hathaway to teen faves Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift -- that features relationships in various stages, from sweet childhood crushes and hormone-driven teen matchups to confusing adult connections and mature, enduring love. Characters kiss, teens talk about having sex, unmarried couples are seen in bed together, and a man cheats on his wife.

It's rated PG-13 but pushes the boundaries of that rating with it's frequent (albeit cartoonish) violence, sexual obsession, and language (there's one \"f--k\" and several \"s--t\"s). Teen boys who are sick of Twilight might find some perverse pleasure in seeing it skewered, but the satire here isn't very smart or funny, and there's little of value.\n|Positive Messages|: As in the Twilight films, the theme here involves overwhelming, passionate romance that borders on obsessive and is at the expense of everything else. Beyond that, there's no evidence of mutual trust or friendship. Instead, characters are mainly interested in sex, ridiculing others, and stereotyping.\n|Positive Role Models|: Like the real Bella character in the Twilight films, Becca's obsession with Edward seems on the unhealthy side; it doesn't feel like a mutually beneficial love. She's willing to sacrifice everything for him, including family, friends, and perhaps her own future. As this is a spoof, there's no meaningful discussion about what the relationship means; it's all jokes about break-ups and sex.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of highly exaggerated, consequence-free violence and spurting blood played for cartoonish comic effect. In one scene, a character has a broken arm with a protruding bone. A vampire sucks a character dry (her skin shrivels up). Another character has his arms, legs, and head ripped off. Characters beat each other up with fists, feet, knives, shovels, baseball bats, and whatever other weapons happen to be handy. A character pulls a gun and shoots a girl in the woods. A character \"juggles\" a baby in another scene. Characters are kicked in the crotch.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: In one scene, Becca decides that she's going to \"hump the s--t out of\" Edward. She leaps on top of him, kisses him, nibbles his neck, and removes his \"chastity ring.\" She also appears in a leather \"dominatrix\" outfit (including flashing red lights on the bra). But they're interrupted before sex can actually happen, and there's no nudity. In another scene, Edward touches his penis through his jeans. He also strips naked; his genitals aren't visible, but there's a shot of his \"saggy\" buttocks (the punchline of a joke). References to another character's required shirtlessness. Becca's dad comments on the size of her breasts.\n|Language|: One use of \"f--k\" and several  \"s--t\"s.

There are no scary moments; the only action takes place on a football field, and though the main character is injured, he is never in danger and recovers quickly.\n|Educational Value|: The movie includes strong moral lessons.\n|Positive Messages|: All lives are meaningful; everyone is special in his or her own way. working together and doing your best are the ideal ways to accomplish your goals.

The music, which spoofs the movie trilogy's outstanding score, is the only really suspenseful element in this episode. In fact, continued warnings from well-meaning characters about the hero potentially meeting up with evil creatures in a land filled with woe or experiencing a difficult journey never amount to much. While this very funny entry in the Christian VeggieTales franchise is consistent in its purpose to deliver valuable life lessons to kids, the only religious reference comes at the very end of the story.\n|Educational Value|: Introduces kids to the basic story of J.R.R.

The elfin friends who accompany him on his important journey are faithful and true. Adding humor and character to the mix are two Veggie elves with comic ethnic dialects. Veggies come in all colors, shapes, and sizes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A few comic tumbles: the six heroes slide down the a snowy mountain ending up together as a giant snowball, and later fall from a ledge without injury. \"Villains\" include a marching troop of dinner forks with glowing eyes, Scaryman (who isn't very scary), and a talking tree who is more silly than threatening.

The action is stylistically simple and comic, and the villains (pretty silly-looking penguins and a wild-haired scientist) are never truly scary. The heroes are zapped, frozen, captured, and fight a final battle in which a giant robot penguin (which looks more like a parade balloon than a scoundrel) threatens a town.

Plus, there are jump scares, and Venom himself (itself?) is pretty scary to look at, with his giant fangs, and there's no real consequence for his brutality. Language includes several uses of \"s--t\" and \"bulls--t,\" a use of \"f--k,\" a use of \"p---y,\" and more. A couple kiss frequently, and sex is suggested. The main character drinks whiskey in a bar and beer at home; some cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, it's an uninspired mess, though perhaps some teens will enjoy the effects, sci-fi imagery, and Hardy's performance.\n|Positive Messages|: Pretty minimal: The bad guys believe that humans have ruined the world/environment and no longer have any right to live, and the good guys believe that everyone has a right to live.\n|Positive Role Models|: Main character begins by betraying those closest to him.

Two characters kiss briefly but passionately, a woman's naked bottom is seen in the cartoon sequence, and a woman with an ulterior motive flirts with Venom and calls him sexy. Fairly strong language includes a use of \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"son of a bitch,\" \"a--hole,\" \"p---y,\" and more.\n|Positive Messages|: In a way, the movie is largely about teamwork, as Eddie and Venom are symbiotic and Cletus and Carnage (it turns out) are not. The characters who work together, including the non-powered civilians, tend to get an upper hand on the villains who can't. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really talk about the downsides of the symbiosis between Venom and Eddie, instead making a poor attempt at comedy with lots of shouting and arguing.\n|Positive Role Models|: There's more of an attempt in this sequel to turn Venom into a hero; i.e., he wants to kill humans, but he can subsist on chickens and chocolate. Eddie is strict with him about sticking to these rules. They seem to be trying to be better people than they were in the first movie, but they're still involved in tons of destruction and lots of death with few, or no, consequences.\n|Diverse Representations|: Frances Barrison, a Black woman, is the only central character of color. Her super-power, a destructive shriek, has made her an outcast and a prisoner her whole life. She shows strength, but she's not well developed and is unquestionably a villain; she's also always shown experiencing violence/trauma/harm. The only other person of color in the cast is Mrs. Chen, a convenience store owner who knows about Venom. She shows kindness, but her characterization also leans toward stereotype. Anne doesn't get to do very much at all, just as in the first movie.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Mass destruction. Many minor characters killed. Violent monsters. Headless body. Someone kicks a store clerk in the head and stomps on their body (offscreen, below counter). Animated flashback sequence depicts a child pushing his grandmother down the stairs, killing his mother with a hairdryer in the bathtub, and being abused by both his father and bullies. Lots of fighting, smashing, mass destruction, pounding, etc. Strangling, biting. Squishing someone's eye with thumb. Venom bites a man's head off. Woman shot, thrown out of moving truck. A woman is abused by her love interest. Brief jump-scare. Venom is very scary to look at, with his vicious fangs and overall menacing appearance. The plot includes the fact that a convicted murderer has been condemned to death; a scene shows prison guards starting to administer lethal injection.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief passionate kissing. In an animated flashback, a cartoon woman's naked bottom is briefly shown. A woman tells Venom he's sexy.\n|Language|: A use of \"f--k,\" several uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" \"p---y,\" \"bitch/son of a bitch,\" \"goddamn,\" \"hell,\" \"d--k,\" \"crapola,\" \"sphincter.\" Middle-finger gesture.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some offline merchandising, but less than with other similar properties.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776c9a7a53e9001e747afc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/vivo", "cs_age": 6, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 6+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Vivo is a touching animated musical about a one-of-a-kind singing kinkajou (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda) who has a great life in Havana with acclaimed aging bandleader Andr\u00e9s (Cuban musician Juan de Marcos Gonz\u00e1lez). When Andr\u00e9s dies unexpectedly, Vivo decides he must travel from Cuba to Miami to find his friend's former musical partner/the one who got away. Viewers who are already fans of Miranda's work will enjoy his signature hip-hop and Latin music-inspired soundtrack. The movie has a few moments of sadness and peril, including when a dog calls Vivo tasty and chases after him, and when Vivo and Andr\u00e9s' grand-niece, Gabi (Ynairaly Simo), travel through the Everglades on their own and have to deal with an unexpected storm and a killer python, as well as a lovesick spoonbill who'd rather die than face a mate-less future. Friends argue, and a girl deceives her mother, but there are ultimately clear messages of courage, empathy, teamwork, and the transformational power of love.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about the kinkajou (aka honey bear), as well as the roseate spoonbills and pythons that live in the Everglades. They will also learn about Cuban music and instruments.\n|Positive Messages|: Stresses importance of friendship and family and how family members take care of one another, as well as recognizing the power of telling others how you feel about them. Emphasizes need to be adaptable, to learn how to adjust and change course when plans don't go your way. One subplot is all about the power of love and how it's transformational.\n|Positive Role Models|: Andr\u00e9s and Rosa are great parent figures to Vivo and Gabi, and Vivo and Gabi are brave and willing to put themselves at risk to deliver the song to Marta. They make dangerous choices, but they also learn from their mistakes and help others, making friends along the way. Positive diverse representations, particularly of Afro-Cuban characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In a sad scene, Andres dies in his sleep; his limp hand is visible as Vivo tries to wake him up. Vivo and Gabi experience a dangerous trip through the Everglades. They survive stormy conditions and the local wildlife -- including alligators and a particularly vicious python that wants to eat Vivo. Vivo and Gabi are pursued. A lovesick spoonbill alludes to \"taking a dirt nap\" and \"hibernating forever\" since he hasn't been able to find a \"date.\" A dog calls Vivo tasty and chases him around town. Arguments and separations between loved ones/friends.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A spoonbill is desperate to find a \"date\" (\"mate\") and finally does. They sing about finding love and how love will find a way. Flashbacks to Marta and Andr\u00e9s dancing and staring lovingly at each other.\n|Language|: A couple of predator animals make threatening comments like \"I bet you're tasty,\" \"you'll be deathly quiet.\" A spoonbill says he's going to take a \"dirt nap,\" \"literal nap for the rest of my life.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Off-screen tie-ins to apparel, toys, games.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d7768b49ab54400214ea529": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-vow", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that this true story-inspired emotional drama, which is cut from the same cloth as the very romantic The Notebook, also stars Rachel McAdams (here she plays a young artist who wakes up from a coma with absolutely no idea that she's happily married to Channing Tatum). It's a tearjerker that deals with some heavy material, including family estrangement, infidelity, divorce, loss, and identity. Expect sexual innuendo, kissing and making out, and partial nudity (a man's backside), as well as some swearing (\"s--t,\" etc.) and social drinking. The sexual content is presented within the context of a couple's deep love for each other.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie's main messages are that we should accept everything that comes our way and try to take it in stride and that love can conquer all (even if \"all\" includes extreme amnesia and strong parental opposition). Also, if you love someone, set them free. If it's meant to be, it will be.\n|Positive Role Models|: Leo is very patient and gentle with Paige, who tries to respond in kind but doesn't always succeed. Their friends appear very supportive. And even Paige's parents, though deeply flawed, come around in the end. On the other hand, the movie doesn't present Paige as particularly strong/empowered, especially post-accident; it's as if it robbed her of the ability to think for herself. And a family snubs a young man apparently because he's not as well-off as they are (they have the bigger house, better car, more expensive clothes, etc.).\n|Violence & Scariness|: A pivotal car crash sends one main character through a windshield, with glass breaking and serious injury. One guy punches another. Some yelling.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man's naked backside is glimpsed; but even more frequently on display are his pectorals, since he often appears shirtless. A woman strips to her underwear to jump into a lake. Some kissing and making out. A couple is shown entwined under a sheet; they're presumably naked underneath.\n|Language|: Fairly infrequent use of words like \"s--t,\" \"c--k,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"ass,\" \"damn,\" and \"oh my God.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some social drinking at parties and restaurants.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776b0afb0d55001f559f83": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-walk", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The Walk is a fact-based drama based on the story of Philippe Petit, which was also told in the Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire. (See also the children's book The Man Who Walked Between the Towers.) Expect intense, exhilarating, heart-stopping peril during the movie's second half -- when Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) carries out his dream of walking on a wire stretched between the towers of the World Trade Center -- which may be too much for younger kids. There are also brief references to/jokes about pot-smoking, as well as some social smoking and drinking. Language includes a few uses of \"s--t,\" plus \"bastard,\" \"goddamn,\" etc. The main character briefly appears naked, from far away, with only his bottom clearly shown. There's a bit of flirting and kissing, as well as some arguing and shouting. Petit painfully steps on a nail, which causes a bloody wound. Overall, Petit's dedication to his dream is inspiring, even though the danger (and illegality) of pursuing it doesn't exactly make him a perfect role model.\n|Positive Messages|: Even though Petit's dream is both dangerous and illegal, it's still his dream, and he pursues it with a clear-headed dedication and purity.\n|Positive Role Models|: Petit becomes something of a hero, despite the shaky origins and inherent danger of his stunt. He asks for help and lessons and does everything he can to achieve his dream. And in the end, even though he's arrested for what he did, he pays his debt to society by giving a free wire-walking show for kids. Parents may not want kids taking up wire-walking/trying out dangerous stunts, but Petit's dedication to his art is ultimately inspiring.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Intense, heart-stopping, breath-holding peril. Some shouting and/or arguing. Stepping on a nail. Bloody wound on foot.

A teen boy is peer pressured by a group of popular teens (who have been drinking and act drunk) into jumping from a high distance into a body of water below, resulting in near-fatal injuries. Before Landon cleans up his act, he drinks and drives. Popular teens in a high school verbally bully the way another teen girl dresses. The movie explores peer pressure and cliques, and characters learn to move beyond such childish and conformist social groupings. It's clear that Jamie is very principled and she shares only chaste kisses with Landon. At one point, she asks, \"Are you trying to seduce me?\" and he replies, \"Are you seducible?\" She says she is not and he respects her for it. Landon's best friend is African American, but the character's dialogue is so stereotyped that he seems like the \"token black guy\" in Not Another Teen Movie. He and Landon have an elaborate special friendship handshake -- including a pantomime of smoking a joint -- and there's an unintentionally hilarious moment when, after an exchange of sympathy and support, they soberly go into their handshake moves. Occasional profanity, including \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"chickens--t,\" \"piss,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell.\" Themes of terminal illness might be too much for sensitive kids.\n|Positive Messages|: Movie's themes include not giving in to peer pressure and not letting high school cliques determine who one's friends are.\n|Positive Role Models|: Jamie thinks for herself and does not care what others in her high school think about her or her beliefs. She volunteers at a nearby school as a science tutor. She doesn't let her illness define her. Landon learns to move past the arrogance and snobbery of the clique he hangs out with in high school. He matures, learns to take responsibility, learns to treat others with respect.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two teens get into a fistfight. A teen boy, giving into peer pressure in order to gain acceptance from the cool crowd in his high school, jumps off a high metal structure and bellyflops into the water, causing near-death injuries. Drinking and driving.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One of the characters in the lead character's peer group makes several sexual insinuations over the course of the movie, including acting out sex between two people while making sexual noises.\n|Language|: Occasional mild cursing: \"s--t,\" \"bulls--t,\" \"chickens--t,\" \"piss,\" \"damn,\" \"hell.\" Responding to a verbal insult, one of the characters points at his crotch. Verbal bullying from teens, making fun of the clothing worn by one of the characters.\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A group of teens are drunk; no alcohol consumption shown, but mentioned.

The townsfolk and one hunter in particular pursue the were-rabbit, with guns and garden tools (again, following classic horror conventions, as in Frankenstein).

They'll still enjoy it, but -- unlike older kids and grown-ups -- they won't be that impressed by how much is said with so few words. But the action (which includes some robot fights, weapons being fired, explosions, and chase scenes) picks up soon enough. Underlying the whole thing are strong environmental messages: Reduce, reuse, recycle, and think about what you're doing to the planet (and yourself).\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn the importance of protecting the earth, along with many other social messages.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong messages about the dangers of over-consumption and excessive waste; the vision of Earth as a garbage-strewn wasteland (and humans as hoverchair-bound lumps who can barely walk) speaks volumes. The importance of protecting the environment -- and the consequences of inaction and greed in the face of potential environmental catastrophe -- are a cornerstone to this movie. Other themes include loyalty, friendship, courage, perseverance, teamwork, and staying positive.\n|Positive Role Models|: WALL-E and EVE are extremely sympathetic. They're sweet, conscientious, loyal truth-seekers who are able to transcend technology and develop the capacity for love. EVE is dismissive of WALL-E at first, but she comes to appreciate his dedication. The human characters are a bit more flawed; they got into their predicament because of their own bad habits (particularly laziness, selfishness, and greed) -- which the movie is clearly taking a stand against. But in the end they come around and appear to have the best intentions of making things right.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A human does battle against a robot, which pokes him in the eye and tosses him around, but it's not too aggressive. Robot EVE has a powerful gun in one of her arms, which she doesn't hesitate to fire at possible threats (including, early on, WALL-E). At one point, in frustration, she sets off a series of vivid explosions in old oil tankers that could scare some very little kids. A gang of rogue robots faces off against similarly mechanical peacekeepers; their conflict is more funny than scary. Human characters are briefly in peril.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Gentle, sweet, understated romance blooms for two robots, as well as for a human couple.\n|Language|: \n|Products & Purchases|: Excessive consumerism is one of the movie's themes.

Apes are imprisoned, hung on crosses, whipped, and forced to work. Characters die, and one character commits suicide off screen. Language is mild, with sparing use of \"goddamn\" and \"Jesus Christ.\" The movie is very smart and subtly discusses issues of how fear can lead to problems like slavery and war. But Caesar isn't exactly a role model, since he chooses to seek revenge (though he does pay a price). Overall the movie is a great combination of exciting and thought provoking, worth enjoying as well as discussing.\n|Positive Messages|: Subtly tackles issues of slavery, prejudice, and war and traces these things back to, very simply, fear of the Other. It's up to viewers to interpret/analyze why things unknown are so scary and why feelings of fear often manifest themselves violently.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character, Caesar, must decide whether he wants to take revenge for a crime committed against him; he does, though he pays a price.

Characters are stabbed with swords, shot with primitive guns, and bashed with giant hammers. There are quick images of skulls being smashed and necks snapped and a horse smashing up against a tree, as well as some scary images (monsters, a bad guy sucking the life from humans, etc.) and a digital orc baby in peril. Characters die, but not much blood is shown. Expect a bit of flirting and a woman in a skimpy outfit; while the movie does feature a capable female character, she -- like the rest of the characters -- isn't very fleshed out and seems there solely to serve the plot.\n|Positive Messages|: At first it seems as if the movie advocates opposing forces working together for the greater good, but this idea is dropped, to be replaced by the message that violence is necessary to attain peace. The concept of \"honor\" is valued above teamwork or peace, but this is ill-defined.\n|Positive Role Models|: The film features a strong female character, but she functions more as a symbol than anything; she's mostly just convenient for the plot. And she decides to commit an act of violence to achieve peace, which doesn't make much sense.

Language is equally strong and constant, with \"f--k\" and \"s--t\" both used frequently. Characters drink a lot, and some take drugs. Consumerism is also a big issue, as the movie feels like a huge ad for Costco. The movie made the news in February 2012, when its marketing campaign coincided with a fatal shooting in Florida by a real-life neighborhood watch captain. The movie's marketing and title (formerly Neighborhood Watch) were quickly changed.\n|Positive Messages|: Despite a lot of iffy behavior, the movie does have messages about teamwork and learning to communicate.

There's lots of shooting -- both guns and extraterrestrial laser cannons -- though aliens take most of the hits (they ooze green blood). Also some hand-to-hand fighting (with injuries) and lots of arguing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: One scene takes place at an orgy. At least one woman is shown topless, several characters engage in simulated sex, and three men engage in mutual masturbation (shown from the chest up). A teen girl is shown making out with a teen boy, and they engage in some foreplay; she wants to stop but he insists on continuing -- then they're interrupted.

Expect lots of swearing (\"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and much more), sexually charged scenes, raunchy conversations with graphic sexual references, and scantily clad women.

Also, that no one is irredeemable.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though the main characters are certainly flawed -- and get up to everything from transporting drugs to stripping -- deep inside, they're well-intentioned. Some reinforcement of standard media stereotypes.\n|Violence & Scariness|: A villain shoves a gun into a guy's mouth and threatens to shoot it; later, he fires the gun many times. Lots of fistfights (and also fights involving other makeshift weapons, including a coffee cup). Vehicles crash into each other; a gang robs a teenager of her iPhone, and a fight subsequently ensues.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some sexy dancing by a stripper; at the club where she works, women are seen in bras and thongs, and one has a very suggestive tattoo. Other scenes with scantily clad women. One teenager gives French kissing lessons to another; an older woman joins them. In a non-sexual scene, a teenager's genitals, stung by a spider, are shown in close-up. Plenty of sexual jokes/references, many of them quite crude (references to anal and oral sex, swinging, sex toys, etc.).\n|Language|: Frequent use of words including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"damn,\" \"bitch,\" \"d--k,\" \"c--k,\" \"c--t,\" \"hell,\" \"ass,\" \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: An iPhone, an iPad, and an Apple computer are either name-dropped or shown prominently. Also, Dodge.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The lead character is a pot dealer, and he's roped into smuggling a trailer's worth of pot (much of which is seen). But no one is actually shown using.

Noomi Rapace plays seven roles in the tale of a family of septuplets who have been hidden since their birth 30 years earlier. Suspense, jeopardy, and graphic violence are front and center throughout. Once the story gets going, the plot moves from one harrowing scene to another, almost without respite. Characters, including some children, die in horrific ways. The film includes point-blank shootings, machine gun fire, dismemberment, garroting, gassing, explosions, and heroines held in captivity. Expect nudity, oral sex, and sexual acts, and a demeaning attempt at sexual intimidation. Frequent obscenities are heard (e.g., \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch\").

Henson) who suddenly gains the ability to hear men's thoughts. Characters drink (sometimes too much), and an unwitting woman is served psychedelic \"tea\" that has marijuana and ecstasy in it (played for laughs). Another character sells marijuana illegally, and a doctor uses cocaine at work (he gets clean by the movie's end); a background character smokes a cigar. While there's no graphic nudity -- characters are covered by sheets or wearing underwear -- sex scenes include eyebrow-raising movements and noises, and a woman chokes, pushes, and slaps a man during sex while in pursuit of a climax (also played for laughs). It's suggested that characters have grown positively when they agree to \"share\" sexual pleasure with each other. In one scene, a woman forcefully kisses a (willing) man; it ends with him wearing black BDSM gear on a swing. Language is also salty and frequent; expect to hear \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and more.

Applauds choosing intangible rewards -- like respect from longtime friends -- over money and fame.\n|Positive Role Models|: Parents and children have warm, supportive relationships. Ali is a tough but thoughtful woman of color in her late 40s, a type not often seen on the big screen, and viewers will take pleasure in watching her triumph. But friends are mostly window dressing -- viewers hear about strong friendships, but they come across as fairly shallow.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Two brutal (both sounding and looking) head injuries are responsible for Ali's magical powers; the scenes are played for laughs. Also pitched as comic are scenes in which Ali slaps, pushes, and chokes her male partner during sex (for her own pleasure).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several sex scenes vividly depict Ali seeking -- and reaching -- climax during intercourse (after which she falls asleep, with her male partner unsatisfied); characters keep their underwear on or are covered up under a sheet during these scenes. Characters demonstrate growth during another sex scene, agreeing to share pleasure mutually. Some jokes have a sexual edge: Ali calls her in-shape neighbor \"f--ktastic\" and later has a dalliance with him that ends with him in black leather on some type of full-body swing.

A character is served a tea with \"a little bit\" of pot and MDMA in it; another character sells marijuana illegally (movie is set in Georgia, which doesn't have legalized cannabis trade).

There are a few comedic pratfalls, but no serious violence, and a few product placements that are obvious but not over-the-top. As is the case with many romantic comedies, the protagonist is a stereotype of a workaholic woman in search of love.\n|Positive Messages|: Positive messages include believing in the importance of love, putting personal relationships first, and trusting that not every relationship will end just because you've been hurt before or are the child of divorced parents. On the negative side, the movie makes light of somewhat creepy male behavior.\n|Positive Role Models|: Beth is a successful, hardworking art curator who cares about her job -- though she's also somewhat stereotypically depicted.

Coarse, raunchy language is continuous, including numerous references to male and female genitalia, breasts, sexual promiscuity, and sexual acts. The women are vapid sexual objects throughout. They dress, dance, and behave in a provocative manner.

Women are shallow, empty-headed, and self-involved; Men are only slightly better. Even the most ridiculous plan can unwittingly succeed if the motivation is pure. One flimsy attempt is made to teach a woman to stand up for herself when a man manipulates her.\n|Positive Role Models|: Conceived as a parody, the filmmakers have taken stereotyping to new heights. With the exception of one journalist, who is only mildly ignorant, the women are portrayed as overwrought, jealous, sexually manipulated, incredibly stupid victims. A male athlete is depicted as arrogant, ignorant, aggressive, and a sexual predator. The FBI agents are all buffoons.

Women and girls appear in tight, clingy, sexually revealing attire throughout. Numerous shots of plastic body parts, including breasts, and one extended scene devoted to a group of women experimenting with a rubber penis.\n|Language|: In the Unrated version, no coarse or vulgar expressions are left out and the sheer quantity of sexual references is daunting.

Like Independence Day, which was also directed by Roland Emmerich, there's a lot of violence, but most of it is on a grand scale -- explosions, helicopters/planes crashing, and deaths the audience doesn't see too up close. There are a few hand-to-hand combat scenes and a tense hostage situation in which people (some in high levels of the administration) are executed or wounded. A young girl is frequently in danger and is almost killed on a couple of occasions (which ups the movie's intensity level), and the president seems dead. There's absolutely no sex or romance, but there's some language, including a single \"f--k you,\" plus \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"a--hole.\" Ultimately it's a crowd-pleasing action movie with a well-intentioned but slightly contradictory message involving both peace and the importance of armed defense.\n|Positive Messages|: The movie has a strong patriotic message, but it's a bit conflicted, as some characters consider it the president's duty to be hawkish and kill all enemies, while others are for diplomacy. Sacrifice is also discussed again and again -- both positively (the importance of saving one person) and negatively (who cares whether we bomb an entire nation if its leaders are a threat to the United States?). Trust is a theme as well, and there's a strong father-daughter relationship in the movie.\n|Positive Role Models|: John Cale has made mistakes in the past, but now he's committed -- to his daughter, to his country, and to his president (even though it's not his job to protect him). The president is a righteous man who wants to make a difference, not just make a name for himself. Both use violence as a means to solve problems. Emily, who's only 11, is incredibly brave and stands up to the armed hostage-takers on several occasions and even video tapes them and uploads the footage with her smartphone. Various members of the Secret Service and the armed forces do their duty admirably, but the mercenaries and the folks behind the takeover act without honor or care for human life.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Similarly to movies like Independence Day, there's lots of violence and an extremely high body count (collateral damage), but there are only a few bloody injuries. People die of bullet wounds, explosions, or blunt force. The weapons range from hand and machine guns to grenades and anti-aircraft missiles, military helicopters, and nuclear missiles. There are also a few hand-to-hand battles and various scenes of executions or close-range murders. Civilians, including an 11-year-old girl and a school group, are held hostage and threatened.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: High-tech thermal equipment briefly reveals (through a building) the outline of two people on top of each other (sex is implied).\n|Language|: One \"f--k you,\" plus \"a--hole,\" \"s--t,\" \"bitch\" (referring to a little girl), \"prick,\" \"hell,\" \"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God\" (as an exclamation), and insults including \"idiot\" and \"old man.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Cars in the president's fleet include a Cadillac limousine and several Chevy Suburbans. Other product placements prominently mentioned or shown include Sony VAIO laptop, Nike sneakers, and Nicorette gum. The director's other White House movie, Independence Day, is overtly referenced.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: The president chews Nicorette gum and is obviously a former smoker.

It tells the tale of a family of neglected kids as they purposely \"orphan\" themselves from their selfish parents and embark on a life-affirming adventure. The story has dark elements (the parents are funny but relentlessly mean and neglectful) that are lightened by the movie's bright, upbeat, clever execution. Comic pratfalls (tumbles, narrow escapes, crashes, a booby-trapped house) and mildly suspenseful scenes (a few shivery moments in a snowstorm) are frequent but farcical. The kids \"imagine\" their parents in a number of life-threatening moments (e.g., sharks, bears). There are also a couple of pee jokes. With a wonderful voice cast of comedy stars (Maya Rudolph, Will Forte, Ricky Gervais, and more), the movie is best for kids who are comfortable with real vs. imaginary violence and who won't be distressed by watching a comically loathsome mom and dad mistreat their very resilient kids.\n|Educational Value|: Meant to entertain rather than educate.\n|Positive Messages|: Values promoted: determination, imagination, hope.

There are a few scary/tense scenes that may disturb younger or more sensitive children. Slugworth is a creepy character (who turns out OK in the end). When Wonka takes the kids on a wild boat ride through a tunnel, some icky images appear and the kids on the boat are terrified.

The sequence in which the mysterious \"Backson\" monster is described could mildly frighten some tots, but otherwise this is a faithful adaptation of A.A. Milne's classic tales.\n|Educational Value|: Much more about entertainment than education, but kids do learn the value of friendship.\n|Positive Messages|: Pooh and his friends offer a wonderful example of teamwork and collaboration. Their adventures teach kids about the importance of standing by your friends, being selfless, and being kind to others.\n|Positive Role Models|: Pooh realizes that helping others is even more important than eating honey. The friends band together to help both Eeyore and Christopher Robin.

There's also some violence that could frighten or disturb very young viewers. Animated characters fall from great heights and plunge into a river. Characters die and are brought back to life. There are chases and fights, and people are kicked, thrown off rooftops, and more. A melancholy flashback tells the tale of a man who wasted his life on the pursuit of power, then died alone. The story contrasts close-knit families from modest backgrounds to wealthy, powerful families whose members are lonely or forced to do unfulfilling work. The lesson is that friendship, human connection, and selfless service to others are what give meaning to life, rather than fame or great wealth. The main character embodies both humility and compassion, but he also skips school and tells little lies to his mother. Kids may learn about Chinese culture and lifestyle and/or see their own traditions and culture reflected in aspects of this film. Language is limited to \"crap,\" \"jeez,\" \"shut up,\" and childish insults.

Wealth and fame don't necessarily bring happiness. Selfless behavior is rewarded. People should have faith in humanity. There's value in maintaining traditions as modernity encroaches.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters from modest families are seen as close-knit, supported, and cared for by each other and their neighbors. Wealthy characters are depicted as lonely and forced to conduct shady business or work they're not interested in. Din is given the teapot because he\u2019s pure of heart. He demonstrates humility in believing his character is more important than his standing and compassion for others. He puts his own interests second. He also skips school and tells little white lies to his mother.

Most parents who've seen the movie before know that the plot includes a disastrous tornado, and an enchanted forest full of red-eyed creatures and talking trees. By today's rating standards, this Hollywood classic is downright tame, but between the twister, the mild peril, and the general menacing, murderous intentions of the witch, some pre-schoolers could be frightened.\n|Educational Value|: A simple reminder that we can always find our way home, and that with a little help, we can overcome our fears.\n|Positive Messages|: Strong themes of perserverance and teamwork when facing challenges and fears and standing up for your friends. The central characters' friendship allows them to act selflessly and courageously.

He lives a life of debauchery and excess, cheating on his wife, remarrying, and cheating on his new wife with an endless array of prostitutes. Many characters are shown having graphic sex of all types. The main character uses every kind of drug under the sun, but especially prefers Quaaludes; the movie spends extra time on the effects of this drug. A secondary character is also a heavy drug user. Language is very strong and constant, with \"f--k\" uttered nearly constantly, as well as almost every other vulgar word in the book. As for violence, there's mostly enraged shouting, but there's a bloody face-bashing scene, some domestic violence where a wife gets punched a couple of times, and a quick shot of a (very tangential) bloody suicide. The legendary Martin Scorsese's the director, and most movie buffs will want to see this, but as with GoodFellas and Casino, this one's not recommended for kids of any age.\n|Positive Messages|: The character reaps untold riches from illegal activities and has a general contempt for anyone else he deems not smart enough to figure out such brilliant schemes. He's eventually caught, but he doesn't seem to learn any lessons. Indeed, he begins to make a living as a motivational speaker, teaching more people how to be like him. Ultimately, the movie makes a point that excessive desire can never be quenched and can lead down a dark path.\n|Positive Role Models|: The main character's very charismatic and entertaining, but unfortunately doesn't have a scrap of decency or humanity. He's greedy, ruthless, and completely without qualms about doing things that are illegal. He's addicted to sex and drugs (which he does admit). He puts his business and personal interests over those of his family. And though he's eventually caught, he never seems truly redeemed.\n|Violence & Scariness|: There's a terrifying storm at sea that nearly capsizes a yacht. Characters fight amongst themselves quite often, with enraged screaming and yelling, and occasional hitting. There's an interrogation scene in which a character's bashed in the face, followed by sprays of blood. In the opening scene, traders play a cruel game in which they toss dwarves at a big target. A major character chokes and stops breathing for a moment but is rescued.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: The main character cheats on his wife, marries a new woman, and then cheats on her with an array of prostitutes. In one scene, he snorts cocaine out of a prostitute's anus. Many of the traders at his firm are shown briefly having raw, graphic sex with prostitutes and other women. Oral sex is suggested several times. There's copious female nudity, as well as male bottoms. A female character teases the main character by opening her legs in his general direction, though nothing's shown to the camera. A shot of a large orgy of gay men is shown. There are several references to masturbation, and in one very brief shot (so quick viewers might miss it) a masturbating man's erect penis is exposed.\n|Language|: Language is very strong and constant, mostly involving \"f--k\" and all permutations, but also \"s--t,\" \"c--t,\" \"c--k,\" and just about every other obscene word imaginable.

Palacio's award-winning novel of the same name. It centers on Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), a young boy with a genetic facial difference. Auggie meets both cruel bullies and good friends as he attends school for the first time; his supportive family (including his parents, played by Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson) is always there for him -- even when he tries to push them away. The movie has clear positive messages about choosing kindness, appreciating everyone for who they are (rather than what they look like), and true friendship; empathy and perseverance are also strong themes. There's some fighting among tweens/young teens and sad moments involving a loss. Language includes name-calling and insult words like \"shut up,\" \"jerk,\" \"freak,\" and \"deformed,\" as well as an \"oh my God\" or two. Teens kiss, and adults flirt/exchange mile innuendo. A teen character finishes her mom's abandoned glass of wine after her mom, who's going through a difficult divorce, falls asleep/passes out.\n|Positive Messages|: No one is ordinary. Who we are on the inside matters more than what we look like on the outside. True friends appreciate you for you who are, not what you look like or the things you have. True friends also stick up for you and empathize with you. It's more important to do what's right than what's popular, but it's also hard to be different sometimes. Everyone has their own issues and problems; just because things look OK on the surface doesn't mean they're not hurting/vulnerable. We can't change how people look, so maybe we can change the way we see. Choose kindness. Aspire to be great.\n|Positive Role Models|: Characters in general are well-intentioned and caring, even if they're not perfect. Auggie is brave and stoic in the face of huge challenges; he perseveres even when it's really hard. But he also helps a classmate cheat and doesn't get caught. Jack Will makes big mistakes but learns from them and apologizes. Via struggles to be seen but learns to speak up for herself. Auggie's parents try their hardest to support him, sometimes by letting him take risks and get hurt. Mr. Tushman and Mr. Browne are caring, thoughtful teachers/administrators. Julian is a bully, but even he learns a few things.

A group of tween boys gets in a fight with a group of older kids; the scuffle is brief but intense. Auggie is frequently bullied by cruel/insensitive classmates, usually verbally or via pictures, though he's sometimes also intimidated physically. One character says he'd kill himself if he looked like Auggie. Spoiler alert: A family pet dies, leading to sadness/tears.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Teens kiss.

So you can expect plenty of action (including explosions, peril, and more), as well as the looming presence of worry and sadness, since June is dealing with the fact that her mom has a serious illness. There are a couple of flirty comments (\"I burn for you, baby!\") and one quick kiss; language is limited to one \"oh, jeez\" and a couple of swearing stand-ins like \"son of a woodchuck.\" The film celebrates imagination, curiosity, and perseverance and underlines the importance of not letting fear stop you from being yourself and doing what you love.\n|Educational Value|: Intended to entertain rather than educate, but demonstrates importance of curiosity, imagination and supports idea of kids using STEM, solving problems, being creative.\n|Positive Messages|: Imagination and curiosity are essential parts of life. Don't let fear stop you from being yourself. It's important to take responsibility for your decisions and try to set things right if you've made mistakes. Underlines importance of love, friendship, trust, loyalty, perseverance. Shows you can work your way through sad/hard times, big feelings and come out OK -- though strategies and tools June uses to get there aren't the kind real kids will have available. Her (very warranted) fear and worry don't really get discussed; they just eventually get figured out. One food joke at expense of a larger character.\n|Positive Role Models|: June is extremely creative, imaginative, curious. She sometimes takes big/scary risks, which can have negative consequences (e.g., trashing her neighborhood) -- but she also learns from her mistakes, perseveres. She and her mom are a great team and have a loving, respectful relationship. The animals are a loyal team who care about the park/their home and keeping it safe. Peanut (and, by extension, June) learns that hiding from something scary isn't the best way to deal with it, that you can find inspiration and passion inside yourself. June's group of friends is diverse.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Hordes of cute-but-evil \"chimpanzombies\" holding axes, swords, and more attack June and her friends many times, with murderous intent; the good guys go up against them in big battles/confrontations -- some explosions, crashes, etc. Massive rides-turned-robots wreak havoc in park; characters in peril. June trashes her neighborhood (and is in several dangerous situations, including traffic) after setting up elaborate homemade rollercoaster. June's mom has serious but unnamed illness that requires long-term treatment by a specialist; she's shown looking sick, weak. Wonderland is threatened by a giant, swirling purple storm cloud of darkness that sucks pieces of the park into it. Wonderland has some big roller coasters and thrill rides; it's exciting but intense when characters ride them. The animals sometimes fight/slap each other, mostly playfully. Steve can fire his quills at will; some impale other creatures. Arguing.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Steve the porcupine has a crush on Greta the warthog; he makes a few comments along the lines of \"I burn for you, baby.\" She tells him, \"I think you're cute,\" and she kisses him once (causing his quills to \"sproing\"). June's friend Banky also seems to have a crush on her; he's thrilled when she says \"I could kiss you!\" in thanks.\n|Language|: One use of \"jeez.\" Also swearing substitutes like \"what the chuck\" and \"son of a woodchuck.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: June has a tablet that looks like an iPad.

As in most other comic-based movies, there's lots of explosive, destructive action violence, as well as fierce hand-to-hand fighting and armed combat (the movie takes place during World War I), resulting in a high body count -- more so than in many other DC/Marvel movies. Some of the deaths are bound to hit viewers hard. There's more romance here than in many of the male-centric superhero movies, including innuendo, brief references to reproduction and being aroused, kissing, characters possibly spending the night together, and a scene in which a naked Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) covers his privates with his hands. Bu language is minimal (\"hell\" and \"damn\" are the worst of it), and drinking is mostly of the social kind, though one character does get drunk. Diana/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is often naive, but she's clearly the heroine of the story, and her interest in saving people means she acts bravely and selflessly, setting an example for others. Both starring and directed by women, this is a surprisingly diverse superhero story with strong messages about teamwork, courage, and compassion.\n|Positive Messages|: Plenty of strong messages about women's ability to be skilled warriors/fighters, the importance of teamwork and communication, and the various ways people can be heroes. Also some deeper messages about personal sacrifice, the nature of humanity (i.e. just because people are capable of evil doesn't make them all evil or worth exterminating) and how love can blossom in the unlikeliest of times.\n|Positive Role Models|: Diana and all of the Amazons are brave, fierce, loyal warriors who've vowed to defend humanity against war. Diana is courageous, selfless, and kind, not just \"the most beautiful woman\" anyone has ever seen. Steve is also brave and selfless, and his team of mercenaries is willing to fight because they believe in him and Diana. Etta is an encouraging, take-charge woman. The \"good guys\" are fighting evil and injustice and war. The cast is diverse and includes not only the obvious strong female characters (who are white, black, and brown skinned) but also two supporting men of color: a Middle Eastern man and a Native American man. There's also a female villain, in the form of Dr. Poison.\n|Violence & Scariness|: The World War I setting means there's frequent battle/war violence, as well as plenty of explosive, destructive superhero action. It's relatively bloodless, but there's a lot of it, and collateral damage can be high. The Amazons train for battle and then engage in combat (using arrows and swords) against the encroaching Germans, who are armed with guns. There's a high body count during the fights with the Germans. Diana can repel bullets with her armor; she also wields a sword, her shield, her lasso, and her wrist cuffs in battle. Several main and secondary characters die (more than usual for DC/Marvel films); some of the deaths will definitely cause sadness. A German chemist creates a poisonous gas that's released in a meeting of officials and kills them all; there are plans to release it on the Western front.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Some jokes with innuendo. Diana and Steve talk right after he's had a bath; he's naked but covers his genitals with his hands when the camera pulls away. Their conversation includes her asking him whether he's a \"typical example of the male sex\" (he replies \"I'm above average\"); she also asks what \"that\" is, pointing -- he (and the audience) thinks she means his penis, but she's referring to his watch. They have a funny conversation about whether he should sleep next to her (fully clothed) or not; that scene also includes references to reproductive biology and whether men are necessary for pleasure. Later, they kiss passionately after he walks her to her room; he starts to leave, then returns and shuts the door behind him, leaving it vague about whether they spent the night together. A character makes a comment about being aroused after watching Diana fight. Diana wears a tight, short, form-hugging/revealing armored costume. A supporting character lifts his kilt to warm his underwear-clad nether regions over a fire.\n|Language|: Language includes \"hell,\" \"damn,\" and \"oh my God.\" Also insults like \"bugger,\" \"weak,\" \"stupid,\" \"lying,\" \"coward.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Nothing in the movie, but part of the large, merchandise-filled DC/Wonder Woman franchise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking at a pub and at receptions -- mostly beer or champagne. One character gets drunk and then gets into fights.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776d43fb0d55001f59bbbc": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/wonder-woman-1984", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Wonder Woman 1984 is the sequel to 2017's Wonder Woman and takes place about 65 years after the events of the first film. Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, who finds herself up against two new villains (Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal) who are motivated by envy and greed -- but is also reunited with her long-lost love, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). There's more romance in Wonder Woman than most other superhero films: Diana and Steve embrace, kiss, and are shown in bed together (nothing graphic seen); another couple also makes out. While there's no world war (or war god) in this movie's story, it does have near-constant peril/risk, with much of the world devolving into mass chaos as the result of the villains' actions. Expect battle scenes, car chases, heavy artillery, gun use, references to nuclear weapons, children in danger, and beatings/hand-to-hand combat. Characters are injured, sometimes gravely, but not killed -- though there are a few sad plot twists. One character's physical appearance deteriorates disturbingly, with blood dripping out of his ears, nose, etc. Language is infrequent but includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"hell\"; adults drink socially. This sequel isn't quite as diverse as the original but does feature female leads, a woman writer-director, and Pascal, who's Latino, as the villain. That said, it also has stereotypical representations of Middle Eastern people and problematic messages around the idea of returning colonized land, the impact of domestic abuse, and lack of consent/agency.\n|Positive Messages|: Clear messages about women's ability to be skilled warriors/fighters, as well as the importance of empathy, compassion, courage, and teamwork. Shows the various ways people can be heroes. Also a strong message about the importance of truth and the pernicious nature of greed and excess. Encourages people to think carefully about their deepest wishes and desires -- and whether they help or hurt (\"be careful what you wish for\"). Also some deeper messages about personal sacrifice, the nature of humanity, and sexism and how it can affect and impact women and girls. On the other hand, Barbara's transformation can be seen as suggesting that tight/cool clothes and high heels are key parts of self-esteem and being admired and liked as a woman. And there are problematic messages around the idea of returning colonized land, the impact of domestic abuse, and lack of consent/agency.\n|Positive Role Models|: Diana continues to be a brave, fierce, loyal warrior who's also selfless and kind. Steve is brave and selfless, too, and willing once again to sacrifice himself for the greater good (though he and Diana also don't indicate any concern about him taking over someone else's body and then using it without the owner's consent). Barbara is initially intelligent, warm, and kind, but she's also portrayed as insecure -- and later cruel and selfish. But (spoiler alert!) the villain redeems himself by realizing that power and influence come with a price he's ultimately unwilling to pay. Most of the characters are White, although Max is also Latino, and a couple of other briefly shown characters are Black or Asian. Stereotypical representation of some Middle Eastern characters.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent peril and risk. Many people are injured, sometimes bloodily, but characters don't kill/die as often as they have in previous DC movies. Thieves brandish and fire guns in a mall heist; one grabs a child and holds her hostage, dangling her over a railing. A woman bloodily beats a man who had previously attempted to assault her. Mass worldwide chaos leads to mob-like protests and unrest. Diana and Steve fight armed security guards with heavy, war-level artillery. Diana is visibly injured. Nuclear weapons are wished for, and nuclear war breaks out between the United States and the USSR. A young child looks lost/disoriented and calls for his father; other scenes also show children in danger. A character's physical appearance deteriorates disturbingly, with blood dripping out of ears, nose, etc. The Amazons compete in a physically demanding, dangerous, Olympics-style game. A flashback reveals how Asteria wore special armor to keep male attackers away from the Amazons, sacrificing herself to keep her compatriots safe. Another flashback shows a child witnessing domestic abuse. Men often take notice and make unsolicited and unwanted comments to women. A man's body is used for sex without his consent (he's not occupying the body at the time).\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Several passionate kisses/making out and a scene implying that a couple has had sex (they're in bed together; nothing graphic seen). Sight-gag joke with Steve eating crackers in bed. Diana wears a tight, short, form-hugging/revealing armored costume, as do the rest of the Amazon warriors. Another female character wears increasingly tight/body conscious outfits as well.\n|Language|: Infrequent strong or insult language includes one use of \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"hell,\" as well as sexist catcalling and self-deprecating comments like \"loser,\" \"weak,\" \"nothing,\" \"stupid.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Mostly car makes: Mercedes, Rolls Royce, Camaro, Budweiser, etc. Part of the large, merchandise-filled DC/Wonder Woman franchise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Drinking at meals and at receptions -- mostly beer, wine, or champagne.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77692151dd69001fe15172": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-worlds-end", "cs_age": 16, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 16+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that The World's End is an offbeat hybrid that starts out like a buddy comedy and ends up being a whole other kettle of fish. Like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, which were made by the same director and stars, it's irreverent and unpredictable, which makes it truly enjoyable, but its edgy content means it's definitely best for older teens and up. Expect loads of drinking -- the movie is, after all, about an epic pub crawl gone very awry -- and scenes of violence (though they're cartoonish and played for laughs at times) with limbs coming off, explosions, outright melees, and the like. There's lots of swearing, including \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" and much more.\n|Positive Messages|: Amid the raucous comedy, heavy drinking, and (cartoonish) violence is the underlying message that friendship will see you through even the very worst situations.\n|Positive Role Models|: The five friends may have drifted apart after secondary school, but they remain loyal to each other -- which counts for a lot, despite the fact that their behavior (drinking, swearing, smoking, etc.) isn't always exactly what you'd want teens emulating.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Lots of mostly cartoonish violence, including brutal fights in which arms are twisted, heads are kicked off, and cars explode. But they don't seem as brutal as they are because some of those involved don't bleed red but blue, making the aftermath seem more strange than gory.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Brief allusions to a sexual encounter in a bathroom; some cleavage and heavy makeouts. Quick glimpse of a man's behind. Sexual references in language.\n|Language|: Very frequent use of a wide variety of strong language, including \"f--k,\" \"c--t,\" \"c--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"piss,\" \"balls,\" \"hell,\" and more.\n|Products & Purchases|: Some products/labels are mentioned and shown, especially by characters who seem fairly materialistic or affluent (or both): Nokia, Audi, Foster's Lager, Starbucks, Marlboro, Ford. And Cornetto ice cream makes an appearance, as it has in Pegg and Frost's other films, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Part of the film's premise is five friends going on an elaborate pub crawl that has them downing a pint of beer (and sometimes shots of liquor) at 12 different bars.

Criminal behavior features throughout, meaning there are very few positive role models, although H (Jason Statham) does love his son and protects his colleagues. However, most of the main characters have non-progressive attitudes and female characters only feature in supporting roles. The violence -- including gunfights and torture -- is frequent and bloody. The people who commit it show no remorse and do so for money. Sex is less frequent, although there is one allusion to a couple having sex, which is done as a means of manipulation. Nudity, both male and female, is very occasional and not graphic. Strong language features regularly, such as \"c--t\" and variants of \"f--k.\" There are also some racial slurs and derogatory comments made by men about both women and gay people. The story takes place against a backdrop of consumerism: people robbing others for money. Though much of this motivated by greed, there are also minor references to this being done out of necessity, for characters to be able to afford to live. The movie is known as Cash Truck in some countries, the same English-language title of the French 2004 movie of which this movie is a remake.\n|Positive Messages|: The main characters are mostly motivated by either money or vengeance. Others frequently express racist, homophobic, and misogynistic attitudes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Most of the main characters are involved in some kind of criminal activity, such as armed robbery, theft, extortion, and forgery. H is motivated by loyalty to his family, loves his son, and protects colleagues during the course of his work. But because he seems to feel no fear it is debatable whether he shows any actual bravery. Some talk about maintaining mental health, treating PTSD. Diversity among the main cast, but no major roles for women.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Armed robberies involve explosives, smoke grenades, and machine guns. Reference to tearing off someone's arm in a fight. Multiple characters shot and killed in firefights involving pistols and semi-automatic rifles. Bloody injuries and dead bodies shown. Criminal gangs torture their rivals to extract information. Their targets are shown bound and traumatized, with bloody injuries. Bags placed over heads to cause suffocation. Characters attitudes to violence are often nonchalant, desensitized, and seemingly unworried about being in life or death situations.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Nude pin-up taped inside a locker door, shown nude from the back and in a sexually suggestive pose. Crude references to genitalia. Character shown topless lying face down in bed. Reference to a couple having sex, but not shown. Couple lie in bed together clothed.\n|Language|: Language includes \"f--k,\" \"f--king,\" \"damn,\" \"c--k,\" \"bitches,\" \"s--t,\" \"f--kboy,\" \"asshole,\" \"f--knut,\" \"suck my d--k,\" \"c--t,\" and \"motherf----rs.\" References to women as \"bitches\" and wanting them to be subservient to men.

The story is about a \"bad guy\" who deserts his classic arcade game to prove that he's not so bad after all, turning Disney's animated adventure into the tale of an underdog searching for a new identity. The movie is accurate in the way it presents popular games/game genres, so you can expect some action-packed scenes, especially in the parts of the movie that take place in a first-person shooter game (guns, aliens, etc.). Game characters can die, but it's only permanent if it happens outside their home game. In one scene presented comically, someone grabs a zombie's heart out of its chest. There's also a little bit of drinking and kissing -- and a fair amount of potty humor/language (\"butt,\" \"doody,\" etc.) -- amid the movie's deeper messages about identity, compassion, loyalty, and challenging the status quo.\n|Educational Value|: Kids are introduced to tech terms and concepts like game code, consoles, and avatars.\n|Positive Messages|: Characters show integrity and learn to embrace the way they're programmed, rather than change themselves for others. Characters also discover the importance of empathy and walking a mile in someone else's shoes before judging them. Themes of inclusivity/exclusivity and selflessness/selfishness are woven throughout the story in many ways. Teamwork, perseverance, and self-control are additional themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Ralph's quest for peer approval turns into a journey about becoming proud of who he is and what he's able to contribute. He doesn't let his official \"bad guy\" status overshadow the qualities that make him good: He's compassionate, resourceful, and sticks up for the underdog. Despite her potty-mouth insults, Vanellope is a spunky, clever, and determined character. In a game that's stereotypically girly, she challenges the status quo. She finds a way to channel her \"defectiveness\" as a game \"glitch\" into something positive.\n|Violence & Scariness|: In one scene, a first-person shooter video game comes to life. Characters from this game (who are more realistic looking than some of the others) fire big guns at aliens, which end up invading other games. In a brief and comic-toned scene, a character impulsively grabs a zombie's heart out of his chest, but no real damage is done. In another flashback, a character is eaten by an alien bug. Calhoun and Ralph are the most aggressive characters; they occasionally punch others and destroy their surroundings. Cautionary tales about characters' deaths (if a character dies in a game outside of their own, they can't regenerate) and homelessness (games that are put out of order) may be upsetting to younger kids. One character does die, but it's in his own game, so he regenerates.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Two game characters fall in love and get married. They exchange a smooch, as well as a more passionate kiss in another scene. One iconic game character, a male wrestler, wears only his underwear. In one scene, Ralph disrobes an unconscious space commander to steal his suit.\n|Language|: Rude humor and frequent name-calling includes insults like \"I hate you,\" \"shut your chew hole,\" \"brat,\" \"pussy willows,\" \"doody,\" and \"numbskull.\" The song \"Shut Up and Drive\" by Rihanna plays during one scene. Other iffy language includes \"frickishly\" and \"butt load.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Iconic video game characters -- like Pac-Man, Bowser, and Sonic the Hedgehog -- make cameo appearances. There are also many references to candy/cookie/sweets brands (Oreo, Devil Dogs, NesQuick, Laffy Taffy, Mentos, etc.).\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: In one scene, a game character pours himself a martini.

One character is a Holocaust survivor; there's much discussion about tolerance and hatred and prejudice, all in the film's fictional context of \"mutants\" with special abilities appearing in the human population -- and yet, this might provide a great conversation-starter for families.\n|Positive Messages|: The film's messages -- that peaceful co-existence is preferable to conflict, that tolerance is preferable to prejudice, that being different is not in any way bad -- are intrinsic to the film's plot and themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Not only are the heroic characters stalwart, strong and morally upright, but even the ostensible villains of the piece have a certain point to make; X-Men creator Stan Lee has often put forward that the dynamic between the leaders of the opposite sides of the X-Men mythos was inspired by Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, and that dynamic remains in the film.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Largely bloodless violence, some of which involves good old-fashioned fisticuffs and stabbing, some of which involves superhuman abilities like a control of magnetism or the weather, or shooting force-beams from one's eyes. Many of the characters have invulnerability or fast-healing abilities that make their injuries sustainable. A young girl is stabbed accidentally by razor-sharp claws, but her abilities enable her to heal from her wounds. Scary, intense medical imagery.

Although many of the mutants are pretty indestructible, the action in this comic book prequel is still bloodier than in the previous films, thanks to the fact that much of it is carried out with the slashing edge of a claw, talon, or blade. There's also war violence, gunplay, a decapitated animal, and scary/grisly images of medical experiments, as well as kids being taken captive. Also expect mild male nudity (non-sexual shot of bare buttocks), and some drinking and swearing (\"s--t\" is as strong as it gets).\n|Positive Messages|: The messages are a little mixed. Although the film's ultimate message is that mercy is better than vengeance and that human beings and mutants can make the choice not to kill, this realization comes after a lot of people (and mutants) are killed. Teens are taken captive to participate in medical experiments.\n|Positive Role Models|: Wolverine steps up and becomes a leader.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Frequent, brutal comic-book violence, as well as real-world shootings, stabbings, and more. There's not a whole lot of blood (most of the mutants are indestructible), but characters are beaten, blown up, shot in the head, slashed with swords/claws, and impaled with blades/claws.

There's some blood -- as well as guns, stabbing, and hand-to-hand fighting -- though most of the action violence is of the large-scale carnage variety, including explosions and super-powered combat. Skeletons and corpses are seen. One scene shows a man's naked backside after he gets out of bed (a woman is lying next to him), and there's some swearing (one \"f--k,\" plus \"s--t,\" etc. ), drinking (the young professor drinks a lot, with bottles all around), and the \"shooting up\" of a serum that mimics drug use. As with all of the X-Men movies, this one explores issues of identity, fearing what's different, and embracing who you are, as well as the notion that killing isn't the answer to problems.\n|Positive Messages|: A good friendship can withstand most disagreements, especially when both parties can communicate well with each other. Killing isn't the answer to problems; instead friendship, support, unity, and hope can save the day. Also: Don't fear what's different, and embrace who you are.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although there are some clearly evil characters, the young professor is a generous, kind-hearted man who sometimes feels things a little too heavily. He's committed to righting wrongs the right way. Most of the mutants in this film are kind, caring, and compassionate, and demonstrate teamwork to solve problems. Some strong, powerful female characters and a somewhat diverse cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action, including super-powered combat featuring all kinds of unusual powers. Lots of destruction and wreckage. People are thrown, stabbed, and shot at. There's an overwhelming sense of menace. Some scenes include shots of corpses and skeletal remains. Structures explode and get uprooted.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: A man's naked backside is shown after he gets up from bed. There's a woman lying next to him. Some flirting at a bar. One blue, scaly female mutant sometimes walks around nude (though it looks as though she's wearing all-over body armor).\n|Language|: Language includes a few uses of words like \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"hell,\" and \"bloody,\" plus a single \"f--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise, plus some vintage signage for Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and a couple other brands.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Younger Professor X shoots up a serum that dulls his powers and helps him walk and seems to mimic the effect of heroin. Viewers see close-ups of the needle entering the vein. He also drinks a lot when we first see him, with lots of liquor bottles around. Other social drinking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d77688951dd69001fe0dbb8": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/x-men-first-class", "cs_age": 12, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 12+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that X-Men: First Class is an exciting X-Men prequel/origin story has plenty of action as the heroes and villains battle it out using their wide variety of special abilities, many of which can be deadly. Though overall the film has a bit of a retro feel due to the 1960s setting, there are big explosions/attacks, as well as hand-to-hand battles and a few intense death scenes -- including one in which a boy's mother is killed in front of him and another in which a coin becomes a lethal weapon. The threat of nuclear war hangs over most of the movie. Expect moderate drinking and smoking; female characters sometimes appear in their underwear, skimpy costumes, or less, though there's no actual nudity. Language is infrequent but does include one use of \"f--k.\" The movie includes weighty discussions about morality, self-acceptance, and fear of the unknown and -- staying true to the original comic books -- makes comparisons between the Holocaust and how people react to the presence of mutants.\n|Positive Messages|: While many characters embrace the brand-new idea of mutants and humans living together in peace, others can't or won't; there's lots of conflict surrounding the idea of whether mutants should try to \"fit in\" or embrace their differences. But ultimately the message is that it's important to be yourself, whatever that self may be able to do or happens to look like. Still, some of the mutants feel justified in waging war against normal humans, who are afraid of them. And even the heroes feel like outcasts. Though the good guys are willing to protect non-mutants, there\u2019s still a lively debate about why they should.\n|Positive Role Models|: Although some characters are clearly good (Charles Xavier) or clearly evil (Sebastian Shaw), many represent various shades of gray and are pulled in conflicting directions. Erik is driven by revenge and anger, though Charles helps soften some of his edges. Ultimately, the X-Men must take a stand to protect the regular people who fear them, even though they don't show the same willingness to watch the mutants\u2019 backs. The movie has some strong, powerful female characters and a somewhat diverse cast.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Plenty of action, including super-powered combat featuring energy beams, fireballs, whirlwinds, and sonic blasts, as well as super-strength fistfights that send characters flying across the room. A fierce assault pits super villains against normal people, who are easily (and brutally) dispatched. There are major explosions, crashes (plane, submarine, more), gunshots, and several flying blades, and a coin is turned into a lethal weapon, shown in slow-motion close-up as it hits its mark. A boy's mother is killed in front of him, scarring him for life. A man's hand is stabbed through with a knife; people are slashed with knives and swords. Overhanging threat of nuclear war.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Frequent skimpy, Bond Girl-esque outfits and one blue, scaly female mutant who sometimes walks around nude (though it looks as though she's wearing all-over body armor). In one scene, a girl, seemingly naked under the covers, invites a man to join her in bed; other scenes show kissing/groping. One scene includes several women in lingerie who are implied to be call girls/escorts; another is set in what appears to be a strip club, though there's no actual nudity.\n|Language|: One memorable use of \"f--k\"; other language includes infrequent use of \"ass,\" \"hell,\" \"goddamn,\" \"oh my God,\" and \"damn.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: Tie-in to vast quantities of related merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: A few scenes show people drinking, both in rowdy bars and in more quiet moments at home -- sometimes to excess.

The action in the fight scenes is unrelenting and, though cartoonish and rooted in comic books, features moments where the president of the United States is pinned down on his Oval Office desk by a knife-wielding mutant, police officers are burned to a crisp, and soldiers are clawed to death by Wolverine. There's a scene of forced sexual coercion during which Mystique forces herself on a prison guard, where they end up in a bathroom -- the initiation of oral sex is strongly implied. At other moments, characters are kicked, thrown, and shot at. Teens smoke in a mall, and Wolverine is often seen with a cigar in his mouth. There's occasional profanity (\"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"t-t,\" \"d--k,\" \"hell\") and some product placement as characters drink Dr. Pepper and Miller Genuine Draft. On a positive note, the X-Men are brave, devoted to their professor and school, and loyal to one another.\n|Positive Messages|: Like the comic, this film can be seen as a metaphor for those -- young people in particular -- who stand out from the pack because they're different.

When mercenaries discover they have landed in a coca field in Colombia, some of them excitedly start ripping off parts of the coca plant and stuffing it into their pockets. In one scene, a number of people are killed in a particularly heartless fashion, while others watch and make fun of them. There are implied sexual situations, including a character telling his girlfriend to have sex with someone else and a woman given to characters as a sexual favor, but nothing explicit is shown. A character explains his plans for world anarchy in a manner that is worth discussing with teenagers who see the film.\n|Positive Messages|: No positive messages.\n|Positive Role Models|: Triple X is given a chance to do some good rather than go to jail ... that about says it all.

Just be ready for your kids to want their own \"yes day\" after watching. Parents Allison (Jennifer Garner, reteaming here with her Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day director Miguel Arteta) and Carlos (Edgar Ramirez) suffer everything from indigestion and physical injury to jail time and a water-logged car and house over the course of the rule-free family day. But their kids also end the day feeling that their dose of freedom has maybe gone too far, allowing the film to send home the values of responsibility, natural consequences, and healthy limits. Their teenage daughter in particular (Jane the Virgin's Jenna Ortega) learns a scary lesson when she's left alone and loses her phone at a music festival, where a lot of the older concert-goers around her appear to be drunk or high. The younger kids, meanwhile, are surprised by how carelessly their friends treat their home and belongings. Language includes \"sucks,\" \"wuss,\" \"peeing,\" \"poopy-pants,\" \"God,\" and \"skeegy.\" The family in the film is bilingual, and parents and kids switch comfortably between English and Spanish.\n|Educational Value|: Kids can learn to empathize with their parents and grasp why parents place limits and rules on their behavior. They can observe that kids and teens must also take responsibility for themselves and their own actions.\n|Positive Messages|: Getting to do everything you want isn't always as fun as you might imagine. Family members take care of each other. Parents/caregivers usually have kids' best interests in mind when they set rules or aren't permissive. They'll often go to great lengths for kids' happiness and safety. It's important for kids and teens to be responsible for their choices. Communication is important among spouses and between parents/caregivers and kids. It helps foster empathy and understanding.\n|Positive Role Models|: Allison is a strict but dedicated, caring mom. Carlos is caring but has harder time being authority figure at home -- that's his role at work. Teen Katie learns lesson about taking risks that her parents don't think she's ready for. Younger siblings Nando and Ellie find out that having the big party of your dreams can lead to stress, loss of control, destruction.

One couple does flirt and eventually shares a brief kiss, but there's no overt sexuality. The consumerism is also surprisingly mild, with only a few cars as product placements. Amid the silly humor, kids may learn how valuable state and national parks are and why it's fun to explore the outdoors with your family.

You'll see plenty of pratfalls and physical comedy, but nothing that feels \"violent.\" Families looking for something without all the strong stuff will be pleased, since the movie's overall message is quite positive for tweens and teens: You can rise above your high school self (whether you were the bully or the bullied), and it's never too late to say you're sorry -- or to be forgiven.\n|Positive Messages|: In this movie, there's good news for both \"mean girls\" and those who are less than popular -- both rise above their high school stereotypes to become much happier, more fulfilled individuals.

The way she changes her life is admirable, even if she doesn't apologize right away.

Language is mild, but includes homophobic jokes.\n|Positive Messages|: Noisy efforts by children to break up their newly married parents\n|Violence & Scariness|: Antic, comedic violence, as kids, parents, and pets crash, fall, and, on occasion, fight.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Romantic/soon married couple kisses, briefly embraces in bed (cut to bed filled with sleeping children).\n|Language|: One use of \".\"\n|Products & Purchases|: \n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Some drinking by adults at dinner/on dates; one scene of kids (underage) drinking.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5ea7e10926c8340042921960": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/zack-snyders-justice-league", "cs_age": 14, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 14+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Zack Snyder's Justice League is a darker, more somber cut than the original 2017 film, with more (gory) violence and stronger language. Unlike the theatrical release, Snyder's edit is slower and more character driven, with greater focus on the severity of the challenge that the band of superheroes faces. The film does celebrate teamwork and great courage, not only among the superheroes, but also regular people, who put their lives on the line to save others. The violence is ramped up and heightened, with far more death and destruction. There are countless battle sequences and explosions, with far more gore. Kids are threatened at gunpoint, innocent civilians are killed mercilessly, and there are corpses, skulls, burning bodies, and bloodshed. There's also a sinister villain in the form of Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), who could prove too scary for younger viewers. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) remains a strong role model, emphasized when she stops a huge terrorist attack and gives advice to the children she saves. She also defends her family and friends back at home when they're referred to as \"puny.\" The language here is stronger than in the original film, with \"f--k\" said fully -- including by Batman (Ben Affleck) -- rather than bleeped out like before. There's one graphic sexual reference, when a character describes a \"reach around\" when provoking another. Due to the darker tone and increased violence, this version is better suited for older fans.\n|Positive Messages|: Above anything else, the notion of teamwork is celebrated. Courage also prominent. The movie lives by the idea that to defeat a common enemy, you need to put differences aside and unite for the greater good.\n|Positive Role Models|: Though equipped with super powers, the heroes each display courage in the face of a seemingly formidable adversary. Wonder Woman is an inspiring female superhero. In one scene, she defeats a collective of criminals in front of a group of young girls on a school trip, demonstrating that they can be anything they wish to be when they grow up. She also stands up for others, particularly those not as strong as her. Cyborg understands the meaning and importance of family. Bravery extends beyond the heroes too. Cyborg's father helps save the world by refusing to give up information, putting his life at risk in the process. Batman also has to surrender some pride and learn how to take a step back and be a part of a team, rather than go it alone as usual.\n|Violence & Scariness|: This is a far more violent and gory cut than the original. There are countless huge explosions and destruction. Constant battle sequences result in multiple deaths. One character is hit with an axe to the neck. Criminals open fire in a government building and even threaten to kill kids. Characters can be seen digging up a grave, and bloodshed, burnt corpses, and skulls are all depicted. There are occasionally scary sequences too, especially one inside a prison when an inmate is seen laughing manically.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Superheroes are seen shirtless. Characters can be seen kissing. One graphic sexual reference, when a character describes giving another a \"reach around.\"\n|Language|: Some use of \"f--k.\" Also \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bastard,\" and \"d--k.\"\n|Products & Purchases|: One character in particular uses high-tech and extravagant gadgets, including a souped-up car. They also describe their superpower as \"being rich\" and pays people for information. The movie is part of a franchise with an array of tie-in merchandise.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: Occasional shot of adults drinking. Character is seen downing straight liquor, before throwing the empty bottle into the sea.\n[Date:2022-07-28]"}, "plex://movie/5d776ad596b655001fdfb0f3": {"verified": true, "url": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/zootopia", "cs_age": 8, "cs_summary": "[Common Sense Media] age 8+\nWhat Parents Need to Know\nParents need to know that Zootopia is a clever, fast-paced animated Disney film set in a world of walking, talking, clothed animals that live peacefully together, having supposedly evolved past nature's rules of predator versus prey. It's a story about an eager young cop (Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), and her investigation involves chase scenes (one is prolonged and particularly intense) and jump-scare predator attacks, as well as an explosive crash, sneaking around in dark rooms, allusions to mob activity, kidnapping, threatened torture (a crime boss wants to \"ice\" key characters -- i.e. throw them in frozen water to drown), and bullying. No one is seriously hurt, but there are times when it seems that they have been/will be. Expect regular use of insult language like \"stupid,\" \"jerk,\" \"dumb,\" \"butt,\" etc., humor related to \"naturalist\" animals who choose not to wear clothes, and some sexy, sparkly ensembles worn by Gazelle, a pop star voiced by Shakira. There are a lot of jokes for adults that will go way over kids' head (references to The Godfather, the DMV, and Breaking Bad, for instance), but there's plenty for younger audiences to laugh at, too, and it all comes wrapped in great messages about courage, empathy, tolerance, teamwork, and the dangers of reducing others to stereotypes.\n|Educational Value|: Kids will learn about the difference between predator and prey animals and stereotypes about certain animal (i.e. that bunnies are dumb and foxes wily). Kids will also learn the importance of seeing beyond the superficial to what an individual is really like.\n|Positive Messages|: Follow your dreams; anyone can do/be anything if they work hard enough and believe in themselves. Stand up to bullies, and look beyond stereotypes and assumptions to the individuals behind them; folks can surprise you by not being what they seem -- and by changing over time. Individuals from different (and even traditionally opposed) backgrounds can form powerful alliances if they look beyond those differences. Also promotes tolerance, empathy, and multiculturalism -- and everyone's value when it comes to making a difference in society. Courage, integrity, and teamwork are additional themes.\n|Positive Role Models|: Judy is clever and determined, as well as an optimistic dreamer; she firmly believes anyone can do anything. She works hard, uses perseverance, and is extremely disciplined and self-motivated, even though others don't take a \"bunny cop\" seriously at first. Nick starts out as an unrepentant scam artist but, through his relationship with Judy, discovers he can be more than the stereotypical shifty fox, just as Judy decided to be more than a carrot-growing bunny. Characters in positions of power turn out to be less than trustworthy, but they face consequences/learn lessons.\n|Violence & Scariness|: Several scenes of danger, peril, and tension. Predators go savage and try to attack other animals, including an intense chase scene involving the main characters and an out-of-control jaguar. Jump-scare moment when a \"wild\" animal held captive leaps angrily in his cell, scaring Nick and Judy; another upsetting scene when it seems a friend has turned on someone he cares about. Creepy moments in dark places (car lot, buildings) as characters investigate a missing mammal case. Chases and fighting (including on a moving train). Explosion/crash. Mobster has Nick and Judy kidnapped and threatens to \"ice\" them (drown them in frozen water), but he doesn't go through with it. Antagonists with dart guns get ready to shoot Nick and Judy. A young fox bullies a young bunny, shoving her and clawing her across the cheek; in another sad scene, a young fox is bullied by those he thought were friends. Some of the large animals/predators are intimidating.\n|Sex, Romance & Nudity|: Gazelle the singer wears glittery, \"sexy\" clothes; she and her tiger dancers dance somewhat suggestively. A \"naturalist\" club is a place for animals who are \"nudists\" to commune together without clothes (Judy is shocked, but human viewers won't be, as that's how we see animals all the time).\n|Language|: Fairly frequent use of insults/rude words like \"dumb\" \"jerk,\" \"loser,\" \"stupid,\" \"moron,\" \"butt,\" \"shut up,\" \"oh my God,\" etc.\n|Products & Purchases|: Real-world brand names get a Zootopia spin (like Zuber instead of Uber or ZNN instead of CNN). Many offline product tie-ins, from toys to books, games, and more.\n|Drinking, Drugs & Smoking|: \n[Date:2022-07-28]"}}
